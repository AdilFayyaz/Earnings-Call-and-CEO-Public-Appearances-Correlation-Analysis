{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Perfect. Thank you, and good afternoon or good morning, everybody, from wherever
you are. I'm Aaron Rakers. I'm the IT hardware and semiconductor analyst here at
Wells Fargo. I think this is the ﬁrst time we get to host a meeting at Wells Fargo with
NVIDIA. So extremely excited. Obviously, company has been extremely successful,
and looking forward to the conversation. Before we jump to Ian Buck, the Vice
President, General Manager of the Tesla Data Center business, I want to hand it over
real quickly to Simona Jankowski to kind of go through a one-sentence disclaimer.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Thanks, Aaron. As a reminder, this presentation contains forward-looking statements
and investors are advised to read our reports ﬁled with the SEC for information
related to risks and uncertainties facing our business.
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Perfect. Thank you, Simona. So Ian, my pleasure to host this discussion with you.
Maybe just to kick it oﬀ, for those of you -- those in the audience that aren't familiar
with yourself and kind of your role, maybe you can just give a real quick background
of your responsibilities in NVIDIA, and then we can jump right into some questions.
{BIO 18454865 <GO>}
Yes. Sure. Hi. So I am the Vice President and General Manager of our Data Center
GPU business, which focuses on all the GPUs that go into servers, either in the cloud
or on-prem and on-prem data centers. Speciﬁcally, I focus on the hyperscale markets
and AI as well as HPC and scientiﬁc computing and server [ph] computing as a
result. My team focuses on the product lineup, bringing those new products to
market for GPUs, also a lot of the software that goes into making that platform
successful, both in AI as well as more generally accelerated computing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01

(Question And Answer)
Yes. That's perfect. And I mentioned before we started the presentation, I watched
you at the Supercomputing Conference a week or two ago, go through a ton of
details on AI and kind of the strategy around it. But where I wanted to start the
discussion was kind of the latter point you brought up, the software ecosystem, the
importance of that. And I think you were clearly a visionary on CUDA and the
importance of that CUDA ecosystem.
How do you see the landscape evolving around the importance of the software
ecosystem, the stickiness of the CUDA platform? And I asked that a little bit in the
context that we've seen others really validated. We've got Intel moving with oneAPI.
We've got AMD with ROCm and Xilinx with Vitis and so on and so forth. So let's start
there. Let's just talk about the stickiness of what you see at CUDA and the
importance of that.
{BIO 18454865 <GO>}
Yes. I mean this all started probably over 15 years ago, when we recognized that
there's a new kind of computing that was happening in the area. And it started in
computer graphics, which really was a simulation of light in the environment around
us. But it was a diﬀerent kind of computing. We were focused -- back then, NVIDIA
was focused on accelerating computer graphics, literally writing, encouraging
developers, giving them a platform to write a program that determine the color of
every pixel.
If you think about processing at the graphics or at the pixel level, that's 10,000 to 1
million programs all being run in parallel to generate an image. Folks like myself and
others recognize that that computing horsepower could be used for other things,
not just video games. And back in 2004, we started CUDA to build that platform for
accelerated computing, taking the portions of applications, whether they are in HPC
or anywhere, and accelerating those inner loops, those important computational
portions and to get them on this new kind of platforms, new kind of architecture, this
massive parallel processor.
It's been a long journey, 15 years of developing that sort of full-stack, accelerated
computing platform that we are today. We're probably the most complete advanced
and robust platform for it. It's consists of tens of thousands of engineering person
years to create it. We're now on our 11th generation of CUDA. And it's not just the
way of programming GPUs at this point, it's that entire platform.
We have an entire platform of libraries, which we call CUDA-X ranging from signal
processing to numerics to linear algebra, of course, to AI, to machine learning, to
computer vision and image processing as well as audio and other things. And in fact,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 12Q - Aaron Rakers
A - Ian Buck
Q - Aaron Rakers
A - Ian Buckit's expanding now to even vertical workloads in conversational AI, with technologies
like Jarvis, recommender systems with systems like Merlin or video collaboration
platforms like we're doing now with Maxine.
Only through building up that platform have we made it successful and productive
to so many people. At this point, we have over, I think, 18,000 -- 1,800 applications in
our application catalog that have been accelerated and over two million developers
developing on the platform. So I think the -- and that talks to the productivity of what
accelerated computing, what NVIDIA GPUs and what CUDA has brought to that
community. It just takes that -- those applications and make them do something that
they've never even thought possible before because of the computing horsepower
that GPUs oﬀer.
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Yes. And one of the common questions I've gotten from time to time, and it seems to
ebb and ﬂow the stickiness of that. You hear around TensorFlow and PyTorch, and
hey, we write directly on that. I mean, I guess -- I think, you've answered the question
a little bit in the prior answer, which is it's much more than just an application layer
that you write into. It's become verticalized. There's a library depth of it. Do you see
anything that's competitively changing in the context of CUDA and that stickiness?
{BIO 18454865 <GO>}
Well, one of the things that made it really successful and broadly adopted was its
availability. Very early on, we decided as a critical decision, a pivotal decision to
make CUDA enabled and available in every GPU and video produced from then on.
As a result, I think we've shipped over 1 billion CUDA-capable GPUs.
And we recognized early, even though we didn't make it bespoke to one platform or
one product line, I mean, every product line. And that's because that innovation is
happening all over the world in -- from research labs to dorm rooms. In fact, AI, Alex
Krizhevsky, who did sort of the -- wrote the -- literally the ﬁrst AI framework, cuda-
convnet, did it as a student up in Canada, as he saw the stuﬀ that we were doing at
HPC, and he had a gaming GeForce GPU, and he ported it on to it.
So I think the access and availability of the platform, literally being able to consume
and be available in every cloud, every OEM, every data center, every gaming laptop
creates that innovation, makes it possible for us to accelerate so many diﬀerent
workloads. Because people see this opportunity and ﬁgure out how they apply it to
themselves, either programming GPUs directly or using one of the libraries or going
to vertical stacks or using the AI frameworks.
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Yes. Yes.
{BIO 18454865 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 12Q - Aaron Rakers
A - Ian BuckI think that is unmatched. And I think that is something that is truly unique in the
marketplace. And because of its wide availability and the breadth of innovation has
now happened, not just that NVIDIA provides, but now all the other people and
players innovating on top of that platform that makes it so successful, as you say.
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Yes. That's great. And now we're at this point in time where we're tiptoeing towards
another layer of accelerated compute, right? There's this thing that NVIDIA has
driven and a few others, right, around data processing units/SmartNICs. And I guess,
maybe it's a little bit lost on some people is that you're building a similar kind of
software ecosystem stack on top of that DPU strategy, the Mellanox, BlueField. So
can you talk a little bit about DOCA, the importance of DOCA and how you envision
the role of DPUs evolving in a data center?
{BIO 18454865 <GO>}
Yes. So before I explain what it is, there's clearly a trend happening in data center in
general. And it's pivoting around the use of the programmability that we see in the
data center, where it used to be you programmed a single-instance VM or one -- the
CPU, and that was it. And today, the data center itself is being redeﬁned. It's
becoming programmable at many diﬀerent layers. We now program entire helm
charts of concatenated many microservices together to build data center cloud
application, running across many diﬀerent nodes, many diﬀerent instance types.
In addition, we program with GPUs and CPUs. So we have two kinds of computing
platforms inside of the system. And CPU obviously continues to provide a really
important role in that environment. And additionally, we're now connecting the GPU
-- these nodes together in unique and fast and interesting ways with the NIC. And
the NIC is becoming a critical part of that data center and also a more
programmable part. Look at what people are doing by oﬄoading some of the
security operations, some of the virtualization stacks, moving it closer to the network,
where the node connects the rest of the data center to oﬄoad a lot of that
computation or workload or latency operations.
So one thing that we recognize is now, instead of programming just a CPU, the entire
data center is becoming one programmable unit. It's the thing that people program,
it's all aspects of that, whether it's connecting it up with Kubernetes containers by
moving the diﬀerent parts of the applications to the accelerators or accumulate it on
the CPU as well as oﬄoading many of the operational systems, security, virtualization
tasks to the NIC and the networking platform. And even going a step further, we're
starting to see computation happening in network where it -- just because of the way
the traﬃc is ﬂowing, it's the optimal place to do it may be in switch, for example. This
is particularly popular in HPC.
So one of the things that we're doing with the recent acquisition of Mellanox is to
accelerate that -- the networking stack, being able to program and that being a
programmable part of the entire data center. Our solution for that is DOCA, data
center on a chip. And it provides a programming platform for our BlueField-
accelerated networking adapters. That allows people to do that kind of -- to programFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 12Q - Aaron Rakers
A - Ian Buckand develop for that level of oﬄoad, running security on the chip as well as oﬀering
a virtualization oﬄoad onto that processor as well as take advantage of the many
diﬀerent accelerators that we have inside of our BlueField interconnect NICs [ph] to
accelerate data center operations.
So we see that same opportunity that we saw in accelerated computing back when
we started with CUDA, with DOCA but now programming at the data center scale for
optimizing data center communications and data center applications.
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Yes. Yes. That's awesome. Let me take a little bit of a step back, when you think about
the data center business in total and you think about the TAM, the addressability of
NVIDIA's opportunity, right? I think you laid out $50 billion going to $100 billion.
What underpins that? How do you think about the attach rate of GPUs? How do you
think about the evolution of DPUs as far as attach rate evolving when you're talking
about customers? What are you seeing happening on that front? Because clearly,
NVIDIA's data center business is far outpunching the server growth proﬁle that we've
seen just most recently in this last quarter.
{BIO 18454865 <GO>}
Yes. I mean the server and data center market, obviously, is a gigantic market in total.
And actually, we're a fairly small part of that right now. I think what is causing the
nonlinearity is the adoption of applications and use cases that beneﬁt from GPUs
and accelerated computing. Most notably, it started in HPC in simulation, which is a
smaller market, but an important one. And they recognized it ﬁrst, because they saw
the end of Moore's Law before many of you guys thought and were talking about it,
realized they needed an alternative path.
What's caused the growth, obviously, recently is the adoption of AI and more
broadly, machine learning. The beneﬁts that GPUs break from machine learning are
dramatic. And often 1,000 CPU servers can be replaced with a single DGX-based like
system. And that's from not just performance, but also cost, huge TCO savings, 20x
in some cases. And it's because that processor or the GPU is designed to do those
kinds of applications, not be a serial processor of how fast you can execute one
thread of execution, but how fast you can execute 10,000 diﬀerent programs
operating on the entire data set.
AI works by data, ML works on data, and it's designed to do that kind of processing.
And we've been continually optimizing it along the way since we ﬁrst started down
this path. With AI it was the Kepler generation. We're now with Pascal, Volta, Turing
and now Ampere, continue to optimize that from an architecture standpoint. So
what's driving a lot of that growth is the adoption of those techniques for diﬀerent
markets. It obviously started in the hyperscalers, where they had the talent to invent
the technology from the ground up, folks like Google and Amazon and Microsoft
and Alibaba and Baidu, Facebook and then the others, obviously, have the AI talent
themselves.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01

Page 6 of 12Q - Aaron Rakers
A - Ian Buck
Q - Aaron Rakers
A - Ian BuckWhat we're seeing now is them obviously take all that to market and continue to see
the opportunities for AI and grow the use case internally, but also the rest of the
cloud. They all oﬀer public cloud oﬀerings of GPUs. And now we're seeing all of the
consumer Internet companies, the Snapchats and Pinterests and Zooms and Zillows
of the world consume and beneﬁt from AI to improve their recommenders, their
conversational AI agents, their data processing.
And the next wave, I think, is the growth of enterprise in general, bringing more
services and solutions to the enterprise. And they can take advantage of AI, where
they don't necessarily have the AI brain trust that a Google might, but AI is maturing
as a technology and machine learning in general, to see the beneﬁts of GPUs and
being served, either programming directly using -- understanding and using
TensorFlow or Triton for inference serving or using some of the more managed
services for delivering those capabilities.
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Yes. That's -- and how -- I mean do you have any thoughts around attach rate or the
progression of if it's GPU attach rates? I think also on the DPU side, I mean, Jensen
has been pretty clear, like, could we be evolving down a path where almost every or
majority -- the majority of servers actually incorporate some form of DPU or
SmartNICs?
{BIO 18454865 <GO>}
Yes. I think it's early on the DPU. It's early on DPU, but it -- in terms of today's attach
rate. However, we believe every server should have a DPU in it, simply to do the
oﬄoad of the virtualization and security and management tasks that logically should
be happening, not unnecessarily on the CPU, but could be oﬄoaded to the
networking -- to the network and the rest of the system, leaving the rest of the CPU
available to the end application and the user for their performance, what it was
designed to do.
You saw similar experiences with AWS Nitro. They moved the infrastructure support
to a separate processor that lets them free up all the CPU cores and CPU capability
for their end customers. And they can manage the infrastructure themselves. The
same is true for the vast majority of the market, and we believe DOCA and BlueField
can do that.
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Yes. Yes. Talk a little bit more about the system strategy. I mean we've seen NVIDIA
with Selene show up on the top 500 list of supercomputers. The company has
clearly pushed deeper with DGX, I think, recently announcing the DGX Station A100.
So I guess, in your responsibility, how deep does NVIDIA go down the path of a full
system strategy business?
{BIO 18454865 <GO>}
I'm glad you asked that question. A lot of people get confused about why NVIDIA is
also -- is being a system provider. I think it's important to recognize, like I said before,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 12Q - Aaron Rakersthe data center is being reinvented now. And we've -- the business and the
opportunity for accelerated computing has gotten large enough where we can break
traditional molds or boxes, if you will, for where we can design in and really think of
the entire data center as our design, our envisioned canvass [ph].
We did that earlier on by breaking out of the PCIe form factor, building custom
baseboards and solutions that were better optimized to allow our GPUs to talk more
eﬃciently with each other by exploring and leaning into NVLink-connected GPUs
and potentially NVLink-connected nodes and systems as well as the work we're
doing on InﬁniBand to do data center scale interconnects.
So that innovation space is huge now and requires a lot of investment, a lot of
invention. And it's diﬃcult for traditional OEMs to invest the kind of money and
capability in that leading-edge capability that starts with a $0 billion market. It costs -
- it takes a signiﬁcant R&D to think at that scale and invent at that scale. So we take
on that burden ourselves now for two reasons. One, we are our own users. So we
have our own self-driving car initiatives, own products, our DRIVE platform. We have
our own research teams that are ﬁnding diﬀerent ways to apply or innovate on AI in
general for our own products as well as for general-purpose research.
And so our Saturn V infrastructure is used for that. So we optimize it for ourselves
ﬁrst. Then we take those designs and those innovations, and we package them up
into products and bring them to market so that we can meet the tip of the spear for
the rest of the market. Our DGX platforms, our DGX SuperPODs, which Selene is
based on, provides that blueprint, that template for the rest of the market to follow
and clears the way.
We bring it to market completely. So if customers do want to buy it directly and have
that direct relationship with NVIDIA, they can. They're not conﬁgurable. This is the
lighthouse juggernaut oﬀering that helps pave the way for the market. And then we
take diﬀerent components, and we make them available to all our partners. So we
take that same baseboard that's inside DGX or inside of Selene. We give it to HP, we
give it to Dell, we give it to Inspur and the rest of the market. We give it to their cloud
providers and it's the same baseboard that is available in Microsoft and Amazon and
Dell and HP. And our software stack has well been optimized on that. So everyone
gets the beneﬁt of it.
So people could consume our technology however they see ﬁt. My -- I'm -- our goal
is to make it available everywhere, whether it be in the cloud, to rent and the server
to buy or any which way. We do that system business both for ourselves to help lead
the market, but more importantly, to accelerate the innovation in the data center
space.
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Yes. And one question that got e-mailed to me, and I just kind of put it out there. I
mean oftentimes, we're asked a question around the cloud's -- the hyperscale cloud
internal development eﬀorts as a competitor in the realm of AI. And we've seen whatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 12A - Ian Buck
Q - Aaron RakersAWS has done with the Annapurna assets and so on and so forth. So how do you see
the competitive landscape vis-a-vis the cloud customers evolve?
{BIO 18454865 <GO>}
Sure. I think AI, in general, obviously, is a once-in-a-lifetime revolution in computing
in general. I think the world has been able to achieve with AI has far outpaced even
science ﬁction just 20 years ago. And so it makes sense that everyone obviously is
investing in their own AI solutions and capabilities. And the clouds themselves have
to compete. They're going to not only provide a channel for all the diﬀerent options
out there and capabilities, like you have seen, but also try to attempt to diﬀerentiate
from each other. And we've seen that as well.
I think NVIDIA is the only AI company that works with every AI company. And by
doing so, we accelerate all the diﬀerent workloads and diﬀerent capabilities and
helps and improves and advance our platform and is able to innovate at a rate that is
unmatched by any other. And I think you see that speciﬁcally in the results of MLPerf,
the benchmark that was created by Google, to help separate the wheat from the
chaﬀ. There's a lot of claims out there, a lot of start-ups, people saying that they have
more FLOPs and more capabilities. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and
that comes in the form of MLPerf, where they set standard guidelines for
performance and accuracy.
As you see from our results, we've been able to outperform competitive hardware or
just some of the start-ups to still show up. So I think that is an important aspect.
Everyone is going to try to diﬀerentiate or specialize from each other in some ways.
And that's ﬁne. From a NVIDIA standpoint, our standpoint, our strategy doesn't
change. It's to make sure we continue to work with every AI company, every AI
customer. And that gives us the opportunity, the visibility and the capability to
continue to move our platform forward.
Just going from Volta to Ampere, delivered over 20x more performance in AI, and
that's what just over three years. So that comes from that innovation, that
engagement with all those diﬀerent customers, serving all those diﬀerent needs as
well as looking inward to what we can do in our architecture, and more importantly,
in our software, to continue to advance AI for everyone to democratize it everywhere
and keeps us on our toes. It makes my job super-interesting. I'm constantly learning
about new applications of AIs and how to make them faster and have to optimize,
both in the hyperscalers as well as some of the new emerging workloads in the
enterprise.
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Yes. Next question on -- to the extent, you can kind of go in any detail you can share
on the Arm acquisition, the data center piece of Arm. We're still early in it, right, as
Arm truly a competitor in the CPU side of the market. How do you think about the
strategic merits of owning Arm? And whether or not it's all about kind of the better
together, hey, I'm building a system stack strategy, we're optimizing data movement
across CPU, GPU, memory interconnects, et cetera, et cetera. What -- how important
is Arm to what you're doing on the data center side?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 12A - Ian Buck
Q - Aaron Rakers
A - Ian Buck{BIO 18454865 <GO>}
Well, I think Arm is super-exciting. I mean, I think is there's announcements today.
You're seeing people innovate on Arm across the board. Nations are investing in
Arm supercomputers for their computing platform for doing COVID research.
Clouds are investing in delivering Arm capabilities to think of new ways to improve
cost performance or application performance. It provides a rich innovation platform,
people to innovate themselves, whether they leverage Arm IP themselves or design
their own. Super-exciting.
Arm is probably the most ubiquitous CPU platform in the world. I'm surrounded by
Arm devices right now, for sure. I think combining it with NVIDIA as a leading AI
technology platform, yes, there is -- better together. We can advance AI and that CPU
ecosystem dramatically, both on the platforms that already serves today very well as
well as the new opportunities in data center and cloud and computing. In a broader
sense, the data center has three processors: the CPU, a DPU and a GPU. And by
bringing all those three under one roof, we can innovate in new exciting ways.
So that acquisition is still ongoing. We're going to have to wait until that completes
before we can talk more about what we're doing in that space, but that is the
opportunity that we see in front of us. And it goes to the broader innovation that's
happening in the data center as a whole.
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Yes, I appreciate you answering that question. That was very helpful. I know it's
probably a better question for maybe if I had Colette, but I'm just going to ask you
and answer which way you can. The supply-demand balance or getting the supply
relative to demand on what appears to be a very out-of-the-gate-successful A100
Ampere product cycle, how do you think about that? Or how are -- how is NVIDIA
currently thinking about getting supply-demand in balance on the data center side
at this point?
{BIO 18454865 <GO>}
I mean it's going to take several months to catch up some of the demand. I think the
-- what's exciting is the sort of the interest and growth in both training and inference.
We delivered a record number of quarter on T4, for example. And with the -- every
time we introduce a new architecture, it's a game changer, right? So A100 is 20x
better perf than V100, and with that comes a new wave of demand and interest in
our products.
So we're meeting that demand. It's always an exciting time certainly for me to help
bring all those and all those platforms to market, whether they're hyperscalers, who
are just now bringing online all the OEMs as they're launching their products, as well
as the rest of the market. So it will take several months to catch up with the demand,
but it's always an exciting time to have on the platform refreshes that we
experienced when you get the injection of new hardware. In the meantime, we
continue to improve the software, too. So our value proposition doesn't stop when
we launch a new GPU.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 12Q - Aaron Rakers
A - Ian BuckIn fact, we don't even release the ISAs to our GPUs. It's all coming through the
software that we're constantly updating. My team is responsible for delivering the
new containers in TensorFlow and PyTorch from the base frameworks as well as the
inferencing stack with Triton and Jarvis and Merlin and Maxine, and we're pumping
out new versions of that every month. So it's a constantly moving platform, which
makes it fun and exciting for all of our customers and, of course, operationally, to
meet all the demand.
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
In the four minutes I have left because you hinted on it, T4 record quarter on the
inferencing side this last quarter. But one thing with the A100 that you clearly
emphasized is this convergence of training and inferencing. So outside of just T4,
what has been the reaction? And what's been the -- is it harder for us to see what is
inferencing versus training? And how successful has that kind of convergence been
in your mind?
{BIO 18454865 <GO>}
Yes. It's going to get a little trickier just because, for those of you who may not know,
this is our third-generation Tensor Core, Tensor Core being the core that is optimized
for the AI operations. We started it in Volta architecture, which is focused on training.
With the Turing architecture, we add -- we did a version for inference. And in
Ampere, we combine the two, actually added in HPC as well. So we have FP16. That's
intense cores [ph] capable of ﬂoating point calculations for HPC. We have FP16,
Bﬂoat16 and TensorFloat-32 for training as well as FP16 and INT8 for inference all in
its [ph] Tensor Core.
So what we're seeing is a lot of our customers can now take advantage of the
performance and capabilities of an A100, both for training and for inference in the
same instance in the same cloud. So it's hard for us to track how people are using
our A100s in the cloud live. Obviously, it can vary. It can be used both for batch
inference. So I reframe a model. We want to rerun all the inferences again that are
going to use the same A100 as the most cost-eﬀective and pro forma platform to do
so. They can also use it for live inference and inference services. We've developed
technologies like Triton, which allow multiple users, multiple models to be run in
ensembles on that same one A100 GPU to optimize the infrastructure.
We're just rolling that out now. So -- but it's very exciting. If you compare the amount
of inference capability that's now been shipped to the cloud in the form of GPUs,
spanning the Volta, T4 and A100, was a huge boost in inference capability. We now
have more total FLOPs available in the cloud for inference on GPUs than is available
on CPUs for the ﬁrst time. So I think that's an exciting tipping point. And A100 is a
massively powerful inference GPU as well as training. So it's going to be a little bit
tricker.
For sure, people are very excited about those training capabilities, and I expect that
to be its ﬁrst primary use case. And as more people adopt A100 for inference, we'll
see some of those trends continue. I still expect T4 to run on. There's certainly a
market for edge and that kind of server, which wants to accept one or two 70-wattFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01

Q - Aaron RakersGPUs for doing more than just the inference capabilities. They obviously have work
to do on the CPU as well. But that A100, particularly the A100 MIG capabilities, may
change the game a lot. And the more new customers can learn to consolidate and
optimize inference to using less infrastructure, the more they can save money and
get the beneﬁt of A100.
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
The ﬁnal question I was just going to ask you, and this is just kind of a secular
thematical kind of question around -- what really kind of got me extremely excited
about the data center opportunity was this proliferation of complexity in these AI
models, right, Google BERT [ph], NLG for Microsoft, et cetera. Does that slow down?
Does this rate of expansion, parameter expansion, whatever you want to -- however
we want to think about it in these AI models, do you see a part where it slows ever?

Right now, it's a chicken and egg. It's -- they developed the model that the -- to the
size of their infrastructure allows them to build, their customers are willing to buy. If
it's a single GPU instances, a single A100 is all they have, that's what they'll design to.
If they have a DGX-like system or SuperPOD to get bigger, and then you look at
things like GPT-3 [ph] from OpenAI, which requires a massive number of GPUs to
train. So that is the exciting part of this time.
The conversation -- where we're at with AI is the advancements of natural language
processing, computer vision and recommender systems, particularly those last two,
recommender systems and conversational AI. This is true human intelligence. This is
not something as simple as what is this a picture of. Recognizing pictures is
something conceptually humans do, but so can dogs and cats and even insects can
recognize -- have some capability of recognizing what their vision system sees.
Language processing, being able to answer a question, understand not just the
words I'm saying but what I meant and coming up with a sensible answer that
because that helps me ﬁnd the product that I want in the Internet or have that
conversation with a bot that's constructive and helpful, that's really intelligence,
human-level intelligence. And so far, no one has seen an endpoint to that number of
parameters to solve that problem. There's no -- they're not even close to the number
of neurons in our brains. And that will continue to grow for the foreseeable future
until somebody ﬁgures out or gets to that point or builds the infrastructure that can
get there.
A lot of the innovation right now is how to combine all those GPUs together, not just
in a data center and electrically, mechanically and through computer technology, but
also the algorithms and numerics to make it work as one. So it's a really hard
problem. It's super-exciting. We get to work on it here at NVIDIA, but we also get to
work with our partners in Microsoft, OpenAI and others to ﬁgure that out as well.

Q - Aaron RakersAwesome. Ian, we ran out of time. I could continue to go on, but I have to be -- I have
to kind of jump. But I really appreciate it. Thank you so much for letting us host this
conversation. Appreciate it.
{BIO 18454865 <GO>}
Sure. All right [ph].
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Thanks. Thanks so much.
