Presentation
It's my pleasure to kick oﬀ the conference this year by introducing our Chairman and
CEO, Lloyd Blankfein. Lloyd joined Goldman Sachs over 30 years ago in our
commodities division and was named CEO in 2006. Over his time at the ﬁrm he's
run many of our businesses including Fixed Income and Equities and served as COO
prior to becoming CEO. Lloyd is a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law
where he remains active on the Dean's Council and Advisory Board. He also serves
on the Boards of the Weill Medical College and the partnership for New York City.
Lloyd is spending time with many of our technology and internet clients here this
week and it's a pleasure to welcome him to this year's conference. Lloyd?

I won't take so much time because I know why everybody came here so early in the
morning. By the way, no need to change my watch. I think at 10 o'clock this would be
the kind of crowd we'd get in New York at 10 o'clock. Only it's 7 o'clock here. Let me
just thank everybody for coming to this conference. James, you've done and your
team have done a terriﬁc job. This is the biggest, broadest technology conference
we've had yet with the best speakers.
This is my favorite place to go and to see our clients. I would say I'm always in my
position which is that of being a generalist and an advisor and really spending a lot
of time in running our own Company, Goldman Sachs, I engage with a lot of CEOs in
a lot of diﬀerent industries. This of course is the one that provides me with the most
joy. But also the most tension and anxiety and nervousness because this is the place
that no matter when I've last been out here, when I've last focused on it, it's always
something that has changed so radically that I have to do the most homework in
advance of this meeting and I'm always living there in fear that I just completely
screwed it up and I've missed what's happened over the course of the last month
and a half which changed the world.
Let me just move right now and introduce our very important ﬁrst speaker who of
course has been always focused on innovation, strategy. And execution as much asFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-12

Tim Cookanybody in this industry and for quite a long time. It's impossible to introduce Tim
Cook without talking about the fact that Apple has completely revolutionized the
way people all over the world interact with technology, transformed how companies
think about supply chain management. And redeﬁned consumers' retail experience
through almost 400 stores worldwide.
2012 was the ﬁrst full year for Tim as CEO. I'm sure to him it seems a lot longer. But in
that year he's done quite a lot. During the year he presided over revenue growth of
45% and sold over 125 million iPhones and 58 million iPads. To date, Apple has sold
more than 500 million iOS devices which is equal to more than one device for every
person in the US and Brazil combined, has sold more than 25 billion songs through
iTunes. And users have downloaded more than 40 billion apps since the launch of
the App Store. While Tim has served as CEO, Apple has launched some of its most
important innovations, including Siri, iCloud, iPad mini. And two new iPhones. Tim
has also been a leader in working to establish a best in class supply chain that
improves conditions for factory workers through frequent and in-depth audits.
We look forward to a great conversation between Tim and our analyst Bill Shope
about fostering Apple's culture of innovation. It's my pleasure to welcome Tim Cook.

That's right. I know you have to start oﬀ with your forward-looking statements.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
I'm sure you've never heard this before. Some of the comments you will hear me
make during this discussion may include forward-looking statements and actual
results or trends could diﬀer materially from those statements. Information on
potential factors that could aﬀect Apple's ﬁnancial results is included in our public
reports ﬁled with the SEC including our 10K for ﬁscal 2012 and our 10Q for the First
Quarter of ﬁscal 2013.

All right. Let's get started. I want to start oﬀ with a topic that has been top of mind for
investors lately and certainly top of mind for the press. Last week David Einhorn
characterized Apple as having a Depression-era mentality with its cash balance.
What's your reaction to that and is there room for you to get far more aggressive on
this front?
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
You really wanted to get started. Apple doesn't have a Depression-era mentality. If
you look at what -- Apple makes bold and ambitious bets on products and we're
conservative ﬁnancially. But if you really look at what we've done in terms of
investment, last year we invested $10 billion in CapEx. We think we're going to do a
similar amount this year. We're investing in retail stores and distribution around the
world. Most importantly, we're investing in product innovation, in R&D, in new
products. We're investing in supply chain. We're acquiring some companies.
And so I think it's hard or at least my deﬁnition of a Depression-era mentality
wouldn't include a Company that's investing a pair of $10 billion over two years. And
when you add that to the fact that we announced just under a year ago that we're
returning $45 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and
buybacks and we've already completed $10 billion of that, I don't know how a
Company with a Depression-era mindset would've done all of those things.
So now, we do have some cash. But it's a privilege to be in this position. Last quarter
alone the cash ﬂow from operations from Apple was over $23 billion. And so it's an
incredible privilege for us to be in a position that we can seriously consider returning
additional cash to our shareholders. And so the management team and the Board
are in very active discussions and we will do so deliberately and thoughtfully. We'll
evaluate a series of alternatives and I think that's what our shareholders want and
that's what we're going to do.
{BIO 3115871 <GO>}
I'm going to keep digging on that.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
Yes. Great.
{BIO 3115871 <GO>}
So there was a speciﬁc proposal last week from Greenlight on Apple issuing a
perpetual preferred stock. I think it becomes a question around what that is and do
we have examples? I'm sure you've dug into this. What are your thoughts on that
type of security?
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 4 of 17A - Bill Shope
A - Tim CookI think it's creative. And we are going to thoroughly evaluate their current proposal.
We welcome all ideas from all of our shareholders including Greenlight and we're
going to thoroughly consider it.
{BIO 3115871 <GO>}
There was also a lawsuit last week through this same proposal from Greenlight
related to your proxy. How do you think about that lawsuit? Where is the
misunderstanding here?
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
This is a good question because I don't think this is well understood. The
disagreement centers around a proposal on Apple's proxy which we ﬁled our
preliminary proxy back in December. It's called Prop 2. And what this proposal is
about is about the rights of shareholders. And speciﬁcally -- I want to be very clear
on this -- it's not about whether Apple returns additional cash to shareholders. It's
not about how much cash to return to shareholders. It's not about the mechanism to
return it. It's not about any of those things. It's about the rights of shareholders.
Some time ago, early in 2012, we were looking at what things we could do to
improve our governance further. And as a part of that review, one of the items that
came out of that was that we thought we should eliminate a blank check preferred
from Apple's charter. And what that means is not that Apple could not release
common shares or issue or release preferred shares. It just says that if Apple decided
to do it, we'd need to go to our common shareholders to get their approval.
And so frankly I ﬁnd it bizarre that we would ﬁnd ourselves being sued for doing
something that's good for shareholders. But this is the position that we're in. I think
it's a silly sideshow, honestly. And my preference would be that everyone on both
sides of the issue would take the money they're spending on this and donate it to a
worthy cause. I think that would be a much better use of funds. But what we're going
to do -- you're not going to see us do a campaign mailing. We're not doing it. You're
not going to see a Yes On 2 sign in my front yard. This is a waste of shareholder
money and it's a distraction and it's not a seminal issue for Apple.
That said, I support it, Prop 2. I'm personally going to vote for it. I believe it's the right
thing for shareholders to have the right on this particular topic. I encourage others to
vote for it. But it's not something we're going to spend cycles on. And so I think the
serious issue at hand is the return of cash -- how to do it, how much to do. It's that.
And we're very serious about that.
But this Prop 2 thing is a silly sideshow and frankly one of the big reasons I feel like
this is we feel so strongly that for Apple, that shareholders should approve any
issuance of preferred stock because this is something -- we have no preferred stock,
as you know. This isn't a matter of increasing shares. We feel so strongly that
common shareholders would do it, if we decide that this is in the best interest of
shareholders to issue, we would clearly go for a vote regardless of whether our
charter requires it or not. That's the way I see it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-12

When we look outside of distribution of cash to shareholders, your acquisition
strategy pops up quite a bit as well and I think it's a question for many investors. In
the past you've done a handful of deals a year. I'd say relative to your size and your
overall cash balance, they're fairly small. When we look forward and think about
larger acquisitions, is there something in Apple's culture or business model that
turns you against the concept of large acquisitions?
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
If you look at the last three years, we've averaged about an acquisition every other
month. And the kind of companies that we've purchased have been companies
where they have really smart people and-or IP. And generally speaking we've in
many cases taken something that they're working on and moved the scales to work
on something else.
Great example -- we bought a Company called PA Semi back two years ago and we
were in the process of building our capability to make the engines or to design the
engines that are in today's -- all of today's iPhones and iPads and iPod Touches. And
so this was an incredibly skilled group of guys and they could supplement an
incredible group of folks that were already in Apple. And they were working on
Power PC at the time and so we didn't have an interest in that and so we moved the
skills to do the work on our iPhone and iPad and iOS device engines.
That's a great example of what we've done. And we've done many, many others that
are similar in nature to that. We will do more of those. We're constantly looking in the
market for things to do. We really like to control the primary technology behind the
products that we're in. And so we're constantly looking at that.
In terms of large acquisitions, we have looked at large companies. In each case that
we've done that thus far it didn't pass our test. It didn't pass our test for various
reasons and we've looked at more than one. Would we look again? I'm sure we will.
Is there a reason why we couldn't do that? No. I think we have the management
talent and depth to do it but we're disciplined and thoughtful and we don't feel a
pressure to just go out and acquire revenue.
We want to make great products and that's what we're about. So if a large Company
could help us do that even better, than that would be of interest. But again,
deliberate, thoughtful is our mantra. We're not -- there's no -- the cash is not burning
a hole in our pocket.

I'm going to shift oﬀ the balance sheet now.

Over the past decade, Apple's reinvented computing, digital media consumption,
mobile communication. There were many countless innovations in the decades prior
to that. And through this consistent innovation you've obviously built a very loyal
customer base, hundreds of billions of dollars in shareholder value. And a very
powerful global brand. I think a lot of long-term investors ask as we look forward,
how do we think about Apple's culture of innovation today?
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
It's never been stronger. The innovation is so deeply embedded in Apple's culture --
the boldness, the ambition, the belief that there are not limits, the desire among our
people to not just make good products but make the very best products in the
world. It's as strong as ever. It's deeply embedded in the values -- it's in the DNA of
the Company. And so I feel fantastic about it. There's no better place for innovation.
Apple is the center of innovation.
Now, if you look at some essentials for innovation, there's no formula. If there was a
formula there would be a lot of companies that have a lot of money that would've
gone out and bought their ability to innovate. Some of the essentials, without
releasing all the magic for us are skills and leadership. Let's talk about those a little
bit.
If you look at skills, Apple is in a very unique and in my view unrivaled position
because Apple has skills in software, in hardware. And in services. And the reality is
that the model that grew the PC industry where companies specialized in a thing and
then somebody did some integration towards the end -- that model's not working
for what consumers want today.
Consumers want this elegant experience where the technology kind of ﬂoats to the
background and the customer is at the center of that experience. And arguably
where you can innovate in hardware, you can innovate in software. And you can
innovate in services, the real magic happens at the intersection of these. And Apple
has the ability on all three of these spheres to innovate like crazy and really cause
magic. The iPad is very magical and it's exactly because our Company was doing all
of those things.
So for many years, this idea -- some people call this integral integration. I don't really
care what it's called in some ways. But it was out of favor. People thought it was kind
of crazy. We never did. And so through all of those years we continued to build and
these skills -- this isn't something you can just go write a check for. This is something
that you work decades for, building this experience. And so, I think we bring that. I
think we're unique in that. I think we're unrivaled in that. I think there are people
trying desperately to catch up in that and I think they're ﬁnding it's not so easy to do.
Now, in terms of leadership, when I look around the executive team table, I see
superstars. I see people that are at the very top of their game. I see people like
Johnny Ive who I think has the best taste in the world, is the best designer in theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-12

A - Tim Cookworld. He's now bringing his talents to our software as well. I'm just ecstatic about
this. I see people like Bob Mansﬁeld who I think is the top silicon expert in the world
and I see people like Jeﬀ Williams who -- there's nobody better in operations
anywhere and I see Phil and I see Dan and I see Craig. I see all of these guys that are
so focused on products and are at the very top of their game and it's a privilege to
be a part of that.
So I look at Apple and I see culture deeply embedded. I see this incredible blend of
skills that's unprecedented, unrivaled, that can deliver these magical moments and I
see the leadership to pull it oﬀ. I've never been more bullish on innovation at Apple.
{BIO 3115871 <GO>}
We've certainly seen this, as I said, in prior product cycles and over the past several
decades. One of the byproducts, particularly over the past decade of your
innovation and I'd say one of the metrics that investors have appreciated your
innovation through is hefty growth and market share gains. We talked last year about
the inevitable large numbers. You've sold over 0.5 billion iOS devices. I'm pretty sure
we can call that a large number.
But when we look at last quarter, you shipped 48 million iPhones which is an
impressive number by any means. But even adjusting for the 14 week quarter and
the prior year's quarter, it was about in line with market growth. So are we getting to
a point in your most important category, the iPhone category, where you've reached
a natural limit on market share gains in smartphones? And how do you think about
that?
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
There's that word -- limit. We don't have that word in the Apple vocabulary. In all
seriousness, the people I work with don't view that there are limits. It's because of
that that Apple has been able to do so many things for so many years and done
things that people didn't know they ever wanted and now can't live without. We
don't really think of the world as limits.
When I sort of zoom out and look at the smartphone market in particular, what I see
is a market that last year was around 700 million plus or minus. It's projected to
double in the next four years to 1.4 billion. This is a huge market. I believe that more
on a longer-term basis, all phones will be smartphones and there's a lot more
people in the world than 1.4 billion. People love to upgrade their phones fairly
regularly. And so I see a market that is incredible to be in, maybe one of the best
markets of all time.
Apple has enormous momentum. The 500 million that you referenced -- that 500
million was done over the course from 2007 until the end of last year. We clipped
over 500 million. However, over 40% of that happened last year. And so there's
incredible momentum there and across that period of time we built an ecosystem
that is the best customer experience on the planet and in addition it's fueling an
incredible economic gain for developers and so we've already gone over, paying $8
billion now to developers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 8 of 17A - Bill Shope
A - Tim CookIf you look back at the economy of the PC market or look at it today, there's money
ﬂowing to two or three people. But you don't see a large number of people doing
PC apps. I would challenge you to ﬁnd any except the usual suspects now. The
money's all moved. The innovation has all moved to tablets and smartphones. And
so I see momentum. I see an ecosystem. When I look at what Apple has done in
China I think it's hard for anybody to evaluate this and say it's not impressive.
The Company's gone from a few hundred million in revenue one year to $3 billion
plus the next to $13 billion plus the next to $23 billion plus last year and so the last
two years we're adding over $10 billion a year. And I also see in markets where we
haven't done as well -- and I view that as opportunity, not the glass half empty.
So when I string together all of these things from the momentum to the market that
we're in to the ecosystem to the incredible opportunities we have in emerging
markets and I consider that today -- this may surprise you. But iPhone is really only
available to about 50% of the subscribers in the world. There's tons of opportunity to
continue expanding that as well. Frankly speaking I see a wide open ﬁeld. That's the
way I look at it. I don't think about that word called limit.
{BIO 3115871 <GO>}
That's fair. And if we look at the opportunity set that you haven't captured yet in
smartphones, I'd say a common concern would be particularly for prepaid customers
in emerging markets, the iPhone's simply not aﬀordable yet to a large portion of the
world's population. I know in the past you've said you wouldn't just create cheap
products for market share, for revenue's sake. But how do you think about creating a
great customer experience that's also aﬀordable to many of these customers around
the globe that certainly, I would think, want your products.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
This is a popular question. It's important to understand -- to understand Apple, our
North Star is great products. And so when everyone comes to work every day and
leaves work, they're thinking about that, front and center. We wouldn't do anything
that we consider not a great product. It would -- it's just not in us to do that. That's
not why we're on this earth. There are other companies that do that. That's just not
who we are.
That said, if you look at what we've done to try to appeal to people that are more
price sensitive, with iPhone speciﬁcally, we lowered the price of iPhone 4. We
lowered the price of iPhone 4S. We did that in September of last year. And in the
December quarter, the one -- the most recent that we reported, we didn't have
enough supply of iPhone 4 after we cut the price. It surprised us as to the level of
demand that we had for it. So we are making moves -- or have made moves to make
things more aﬀordable.
Also if you look back at Apple's history what you would see is, if you take something
like an iPod, when we came out with iPod it was $399. Where is iPod today? Today
you can go out and buy an iPod Shuﬄe for $49. And so instead of saying -- How can
we cheapen this iPod to get it lower? We said -- How can we do a great product?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 9 of 17A - Bill Shope
A - Tim CookAnd we were able to do that at a cost that enabled us to sell it at a very low price of
$49 and it appealed to a lot more people.
The same thing. But a diﬀerent concept in some ways is for years people said -- Why
don't you have a Mac that's less than $500 or less than $1000 or whatever? Many,
many people asked that and frankly we worked on this. But we concluded we
couldn't do a great product. And so we didn't. But what did we do? We invented
iPad. And now all of a sudden we have an incredible experience and it starts at $329.
So sometimes you can take the issue, if you will, or where you might look at it as an
issue. And you can solve it in diﬀerent ways. But the North Star for us is always great
product. Not how do we hit a price point? That has served us well. I think it will
continue to serve us well. And I think on this one we really have a track record to
show it.
{BIO 3115871 <GO>}
So we shouldn't look at it as a limit? Every year there are pundits that push towards
what they think the greatest new feature should be on a smartphone and in various
consumer electronics products. And in the past it has generally, we can safely say,
been a mistake to question Apple's choices on those fronts. But more recently we've
seen a lot of commentary that consumers want larger screen sizes, for instance, on
iPhones or on smartphones than what Apple oﬀers. You've argued that the iPhone 5
currently has the optimal screen size for your customer base and for most customers.
Can you walk me through how you get to that conclusion and frankly your
conﬁdence in that conclusion?
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
Let me -- nothing I say -- I don't want to say what we will do or won't do. Don't
interpret anything I say along those lines. The truth is that -- let me go back and
compare it to the PC industry for a minute.
The PC industry over the years, the way that companies competed were two things --
specs and price. And so people would want to say -- I've got the largest drive or I've
got the fastest processor. Or in the camera business people began to say -- I've got
the most megapixels. The truth is customers want a great experience and they want
quality and they want that ah-ha moment each time they use the product.
That's rarely a function of any of those things. These are things that technology
companies invent because they can't have a great experience and so they talk about
the spec of something. Do you know the speed of an AX processer? You probably
don't. Does it matter? Does it really matter at the end of the day? You want a
fabulous experience when you open it and use the product.
And so, if you look at displays, if you kind of contrast this to displays, some people
are focused on size. There's a few other things about the display that are important.
Some people use displays like OLED displays -- the color saturation is awful. So if
you ever buy anything online and you want to really know what the color is as manyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 10 of 17A - Bill Shope
A - Tim Cook
A - Bill Shope
A - Tim Cookpeople do, you should really think twice before you depend on the color that -- of
the OLED display. The Retina display is twice as bright as an OLED display.
I only bring these points up to say there are many attributes of a display and what
Apple does is sweat every detail. We care about all of them and we want the best
display. I think we've got it. I feel great about it. I'm not going to comment about
what we're going to do in the future because that releases our magic. I'm not going
to do that. But it's always broader -- the customer experience is always broader than
that which can be deﬁned by a simple number.
{BIO 3115871 <GO>}
That makes sense. I think in the past we've seen -- I think people try and read Apple's
commentary as -- We will never do such-and-such. Or we have a religion against
such-and-such.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
The only thing we'll never do is make a crappy product. We're going to make a great
product. And so that's the only religion that we have is we must do something great,
something bold, something ambitious. We want the customer to be at the center of
it. We want to enrich people's lives. And all of this other stuﬀ is -- we sweat the
details on those. Hopefully we've proven over the years that this is something we can
do.
{BIO 3115871 <GO>}
Looking at the iPad -- we focused a lot on the iPhone. But I want to touch on the iPad
if I could. You shipped 23 million units last quarter. Very strong quarter. That was
despite the iPad mini being in short supply. When you think about the three years
you've been in the tablet business, how do you think about the opportunity set for
Apple going forward at this point now that you've learned more and more about the
industry and how customers respond to your product? And frankly, how do you think
about the future of the broader computer industry as a result of that?
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
I think the tablet market will be huge. It is a huge opportunity for Apple. It's one of
those areas that show what I mentioned earlier of software, hardware. And services
being integrated and creating an experience that is jaw-dropping. I think it's huge.
To put the 23 million in some context, HP who is the world's largest PC seller, in that
same quarter sold 15 million PCs. So 50% plus more iPads were sold in that quarter
than PCs. And in fact, if you look at the full year last year, there were more iPads sold
than HP sold of their entire PC lineup.
And so there has been a sea change here. But I think we're in the early innings of this
game. The tablet market last year, the projections I've seen would indicate there was
about 120 million tablets sold last year. The projection is that this is going to triple --
triple -- in four years. And so when you think about that -- I think the actual number is
375 million. That's more PCs that are being sold today around the world and the PC
growth rate as you know is actually contracting, not growing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 11 of 17A - Bill ShopeSo the tablet is attracting people who have never owned a PC and people who have
owned them but aren't great in the experience. And Apple is at the forefront. The
iPad is absolutely the poster child of the post-PC revolution. So if you look at what
we bring there, we've worked really hard on our ecosystem. There are over 300,000
apps that have been custom made to take advantage of the big, beautiful canvas
that iPad has. The other guys have a few hundred. So we have a signiﬁcant lead in
this area.
Also, I think the tablet, as I mentioned before, you can see the whole of Apple
coming out here. If you look at -- I have no idea what market share is because we're
the only Company that really reports how many units we sell. But if you look at
usage, there are companies out there that have very, very good metrics in usage and
if you look at -- IBM, as an example, did a study on Black Friday. This was shocking. It
was shocking to even us.
On Black Friday, the product that there was the most shopping done on of any
mobile device was iPad. And I don't mean iPad compared to a single brand
somewhere. I mean iPad was twice as much as the total of every Android device.
Every one of them. Every phone, every tablet. Twice as much. And so, why is this? It's
because it's an incredible experience. By the way, iPhone in that same survey was
almost twice as much as all Android devices.
And so we really sweat the details and so we have a greater customer experience
and the data is very clear that customers use them a lot more. They clearly use them
to a much higher degree than whatever our share might be. So I'm not sure what
people are doing with these other tablets. But that's what we care about. We want
people to love our products and use our products -- not just buy them. Our
relationship starts there. It doesn't end there.
The other thing that's so profound about iPad is that in this short period of time, it's
moving and being sold in a large way in all the key markets. So we ﬁnd ourselves in
virtually every Fortune 500 Company, in almost every global 500 Company. We ﬁnd
ourselves in education. And we've put a lot of energy in that area of making it easy
for people to do fantastic textbooks that are incredibly engaging and of course we
ﬁnd ourselves in consumer. But usually it takes a long time for products to engage all
of these markets. We've kind of already done that. But I still think we're in the initial
innings of this.
So this is very exciting. It's very profound for the industry. I think it once again shows
that the age old model of everyone doing a sliver of something and hoping that it
comes together in a product that has a great experience, customers aren't buying it.
They don't like it. They want integration and Apple can do that better than anyone.

Part of the success of the iPad last quarter was the iPad mini. By all accounts it was a
hit over the holiday season. I think this also serves as a unique argument for the ﬂip
side of the question I had earlier on pricing. You started out with the iPad at a very
aggressive price point and then you came out with the iPad mini now which certainlyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 12 of 17A - Tim Cooknot only in form factor but in price I think appeals to a whole new group of
customers.
When you look at that, it did have an impact on iPad ASPs last quarter. It certainly
had an impact on overall gross margins for Apple. From a ﬁnancial perspective and
an innovation perspective, can we use that to help us understand how you think
about the tradeoﬀs of going after market share, the impact on the ﬁnancials perhaps
in the near-term and the overall market opportunity expansion that may trigger?
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
The truth is in diﬀerent ways I've been asked this question for many years. I think the
ﬁrst time I got asked about cannibalization was when Apple came out with the iBook.
And people were deathly worried that it would cannibalize the PowerBook and
portables went on to be the three-quarters or more percentage of the Macs and
Macs hit an all-time record last year. If you looked at -- when we came out with iPad,
what did people worry about? They worried -- Oh, my God! You're going to kill the
Mac! What have you done? You're stupid!
And so, the cannibalization question raises its head a lot. And the truth is we don't
really think about it that much. Our basic belief is that if we don't cannibalize,
someone else will. And in the case of iPad in particular, I would argue that the
Windows PC market is huge and there's a lot more there to cannibalize than there is
of Mac or of iPad as far as that goes relative to iPad mini. And so, I think if a Company
ever begins to use cannibalization as their primary or even a major factor in their
decision making of what products to go into, it's the beginning of the end. Because
there will always be somebody else and so here's the way I see us on iPad mini.
When we looked at iPad, what you would ﬁnd if you looked at some data, you would
ﬁnd that iPad -- that over 50% of the people in countries like China and Brazil that
are buying an iPad don't own an Apple product. So this is a huge thing for us to go
out and show people what Apple is, to introduce them to the Company. And as you
probably know, through the years we've found a very clear correlation between
people getting in and being introduced to Apple and buying their ﬁrst Apple
product and some percentage of them buying other Apple products.
We saw that with iPod creating a halo for the Mac. We've seen that with iPhone
creating a halo for iPad. We've seen that with iPad creating a halo for iPhone. And all
of these things have synergies and stuﬀ. So it's not about just selling a point product.
It's about looking at the total.
And as you can probably tell from my response on the tablet question, I think this is
a huge opportunity. And so it seems perfectly reasonable to me to have an iPad and
the iPad mini. I would argue it probably wouldn't be smart not to. This is one of the --
I think this is going to be the mother of all markets. And so I think we did the right
thing. Of course our customers are voting in their buying. We had a diﬃcult time last
quarter with satisfying everyone. But we're working really hard on that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-12

I think some of these questions are really -- from an investor perspective it's about
the question of whether Apple's balancing revenue growth opportunities with gross
margin preservation. How do you think about -- your gross margins have been well
about your technology peers for many years now and frankly, each notch up it goes,
investors expect more obviously. But how do you think about your longer-term gross
margin trajectory? When you pull all these things together -- you make great
products, you're hitting price points that help consumers get involved in your
platform. How do you think about that trajectory longer-term?
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
I don't want to get into projecting margins beyond what we do in conference calls
and those sorts of things. But here's kind of the way we look at it is that you could
always -- we've done this many times. You could go in and accept a lower margin on
any product at any given time for a strategic reason and that strategic reason may be
our entry into that area. It may be other things. But sort of at the background, we
always know that this halo eﬀect plays. We had conﬁdence in our ability to execute
the supply chain and work down cost curves.
In the area of tablets, we think the market is huge and it makes sense to have
another product there because people wanted a full iPad experience. But in
something smaller and lighter. And because we're not a hardware Company, we
have other ways to make money and reward shareholders. This doesn't get noticed
very much for some reason.
Last quarter, if you looked at our services and software revenues, it was $3.7 billion. I
know some people look at that and say that's $3.7 billion divided by 54 or
something. But if you look at that versus software and services companies, that's an
incredible amount of revenue. And so because we're not a hardware company, there
are other things that we're doing and could do to have revenues and proﬁts ﬂow. So
again, we don't look at the sale of a product as our last part of the relationship with
the customer. It's the ﬁrst.
And our stores do a fantastic job of helping people along their journey get the most
out of their products. We are very focused on that. We're focused on that because
it's great for the customer. But of course there's also ﬁnancial beneﬁt in doing that
although our focus is on the customer.
So being larger than a hardware company aﬀords us the ability to not worry about so
much in the very short-term. We're managing Apple for the long-term. I know
people care about quarters and so forth and we care. But the decisions we make, the
profound decisions we make, are for Apple's long-term health. Not for the short-
term 90 day clock.

A - Tim CookLooking at Apple as a platform Company, not a hardware Company, can you help us
understand some of the diﬀerences between the platform strategy in developed
markets which I think we all understand fairly well and how that may evolve in
emerging markets. If we take China, for example, the App Store, iCloud, are all very
popular with your customer base over there. But in many emerging regions, for
reasons outside of Apple's control, customers can't buy music from iTunes or movies
from iTunes. So there are diﬀerences that you have to contend with. How do you
think about that and how the platform strategy potentially has to evolve with
emerging markets?
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
It's a good question. Last year, we put enormous energy in expanding our ecosystem
geographically. If you now look, our App Store is operating in 155 countries. Our
iTunes store is operating in over 100 countries. Free iBooks are in over 100 countries,
paid iBooks are in over 50 countries. If you look at services like iCloud, iCloud
operates in virtually every country. Messages operates in every country that we can.
There are some government restrictions there. There are government restrictions in
some countries around Apple's sale of movies. But there's only really one major
country where we're not selling movies.
So I really feel like we advanced signiﬁcantly last year in getting our infrastructure
around the world at a diﬀerent level. We've got further to go in some place but we
really advanced the ball. Our intention is to have a great ecosystem everywhere and
have all of our ecosystem everywhere. Not just portions of it. But you're right, in
some cases we're prevented from doing so. But since we don't believe in limits, we
keep knocking at the door and trying to convince people that we conduct ourselves
well and I think we'll eventually -- maybe we'll eventually get in there. But there is
versus last year at this time when we were talking, there's a dramatic diﬀerence in
our ecosystem in emerging markets than now.
{BIO 3115871 <GO>}
I think that's certainly evident. Earlier you were talking about the relationship with the
customer after the product is purchased and you mentioned the retail strategy. So I
want to dig into that a bit if I could. You spend about $1 billion a year on CapEx for
retail. Can you walk us through the state of the retail strategy today and in particular,
your growth plans for retail in emerging markets?
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
There's no better place to discover, explore. And learn about our products than in
retail. Our team members there are the most amazing, awesome, incredible people
on earth. It's the best retail experience. It's a retail experience where you walk in and
you instantly realize this store is not here for the purpose of selling, it's here for the
purpose of serving. The Genius Bar helps you not only with an issue. But it helps you
get more out of your Apple products over the life of them. The store acts as a
gathering place. It's a place that has an important role in the community.
So if you look at an agenda on an Apple store for any given day, you might ﬁnd that
there's a youth program going on where the kids from a local elementary school areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 15 of 17A - Bill Shopecoming in the store as part of a ﬁeld trip. You might ﬁnd that there's a local musician
that's entertaining people in that store that night. It's incredibly exciting what these
stores do. I'm not even sure store is the right word any more. They've taken on a role
much broader than that. They are the face of Apple for almost all of our customers.
People don't think about the Cupertino headquarters. They think about the local
Apple store.
So because we focused on those things, people love them. Last quarter we
welcomed 120 million in our stores. We only have a little over 400. That's almost 10
million people a week. Last year we welcomed 370 million into the stores. This is
huge. And in fact, it's so huge that some of our stores aren't big enough. But this is
sort of like the issue around cash. It's a privilege to have this kind of issue. So what
are we doing? We're closing 20 of our stores and moving them and making them
larger this year. In addition to that 20, we're adding 30 more.
Those 30 will be disproportionally outside the US. We're going to place our ﬁrst
store in Turkey this year. We're super excited about that. That gets us in 13 countries.
We've got a long way to go. 13. There's a lot more countries in the world. We'll never
be in every one of them but we'll certainly be in more. We added 4 stores in Greater
China last quarter. We're really on our way there. We're going to add lots more.
There's an incredible opportunity there and we want to serve our customers there.
One of the things that's probably not understood well about the stores is -- and this
is my opinion. But I don't think we would have been nearly as successful with iPad as
an example if it weren't for our stores. Because here's a product coming out. It's
diﬀerent. People's view of a tablet -- the tablet that was ingrained in their mind was
this heavy thing that the Hertz guy was holding that no one wanted. Nobody would
want one of those. A few hundred thousand sold a year or something.
But our store is a place to go and explore and discover and try it out and see what it
will do. And I don't think that the launch would have been nearly as successful
without stores that welcome people in at 10 million a week and show this. I think it
gives Apple an incredible competitive advantage to have these stores that I think
everybody that's tried it has found out it's not so easy to replicate in order to launch
these products and really educate people about a new category.
So I'm incredibly bullish on the stores. We're going to continue to invest like crazy in
them. Our team members are the best in the world and the ﬁnancial results are
great. The average store last year was over $50 million in revenue. Who would've
thought a store could do that? And so, I think there's no place quite like it. I was
talking to some employees the other day. I don't have very many bad days. I'm very
fortunate from the point of view. But if I ever feel I'm dropping down from an excited
level, I go in a store and it instantly changes. It's like a Prozac or something. I don't
know. It's unbelievable, the energy in our stores and to talk to our team members
and our customers in there. It's a feeling like no other. We're continuing to invest
here.

what are you most proud of?
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
I'm incredibly proud over a lot of things. I'm most proud of our employees. I have
the privilege every day of working with people who want to make the very best
products in the world. They're there to do not only great work. But the best work in
their lives. They're there to do it without limits. They're the most creative people on
earth. It's a privilege of a lifetime for me to be at Apple at this point in time and work
with all these people.
I'm incredibly proud of the products that we have. We have the best smartphone on
the market, we have the best tablet on the market, we have the best PC on the
market, we have the best digital music player on the market. For those things that
we've elected to do. And we continue to focus on a few, they're really great. I'm
incredibly bullish about the future and what Apple can do and more contributions it
can make to the world. I'm very proud that we're out front, that we have a spine on
supply responsibility. I'm incredibly happy that we're changing people's lives, that
we don't care if people are lobbing grenades from the sidelines, that we're going to
do what's right and just in moving the ball forward.
I'm incredibly proud that we're doing heavy lifting with the environment, that we've
designed our products with the environment in mind, that we've done that better
than everyone else, that we've eliminating toxins. I'm proud that we have the largest
private solar farm in -- ever. Of anywhere. That we can run our data centers on 100%
renewable energy. I'm really proud over all these things. I don't mean to gush. But
it's how I feel. And it's both the privilege of a lifetime and humbling to work with the
people that I get to work with. It's pretty incredible.
