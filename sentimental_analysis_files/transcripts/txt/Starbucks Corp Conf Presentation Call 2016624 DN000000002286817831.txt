Good morning, and welcome to BI's Analyst Brieﬁng, Restaurant Winners Eat from
the Big Data Menu. I'm Michael Halen, a Consumer Analyst at Bloomberg
Intelligence, and happy to say that we'll be joined by Mike Lukianoﬀ, Chief Analytics
Oﬃcer of Fishbowl.
So just a few housekeeping notes before we get going here. First of all, the
presentation will be recorded and available for playback. At the bottom of the slide
window, you're going to notice that you can adjust the volume and maximize your
screen, we recommend that you maximize the screen for the best quality. Feel free to
ask questions using the Q&A panel to the right of the slides. We'll set aside some
time for Q&A at the end of the presentation. Copy of the slides will be distributed via
email following the presentation. Any additional questions can be sent to
bievents@bloomberg.net.
So for those of you who are not familiar with Bloomberg Intelligence, this is
Bloomberg's in-house equity research platform, we provide unique analysis and
context on industries, companies, as well as government litigation, economic and
credit factors, and this is all integrated within the Bloomberg Terminal. We have very
broad coverage that spans more than 130 industries and 4,000 companies globally.
It's really data-driven research and we boast more than 300 third-party providers.
Our experienced analysts average more than 20 years of buy and sell-side research
experience and we don't have an axe to grind, there's no buy or sell
recommendations, so we can give our customers a very objective viewpoint.
Restaurant research can be found on BI EATS, E-A-T-S Go [ph]. Terminal users can
explore our analysis for the pressing issues. We have key short and long-term
themes, key indicators, earnings interpretations and industry primers. We have a
dedicated data library from third-party data sources as well as publicly available
data, you can monitor tools for news and data on companies within the industry. My
colleague Jen Bartashus and I cover 25 publicly traded restaurant companies.
And so with that, I'd like to give the formal introduction to Mike Lukianoﬀ, the Chief
Analytics Oﬃcer of Fishbowl. Mike and I met earlier this year and his two restaurantFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-23

Mike Lukianoﬀnerds we hit it oﬀ immediately. You might be familiar with some of his work, he was
the brains behind the Shake Shack site selection research that Bloomberg
Intelligence and Fishbowl did a couple of months back. Mike?
Thanks for having me. You know, excited to be with you today and talk in a little bit
about, you know, what's going on in restaurant technology and data. Little bit of
background. So (Technical Diﬃculty)
We do apologize, ladies and gentlemen. Our speakers will be returning
momentarily. Please do not hang up, they are on their way back. Once again, ladies
and gentlemen, please do not disconnect, our speakers are on their way back.
(Technical Diﬃculty) provider -- currently Fishbowl is the largest provider of -- of
really marketing automation and -- and digital marketing to the restaurant industry.
You know, I -- I joined -- I joined the company a year ago when -- when my company
was purchased. And really for -- for this big vision of understanding, you know, there
is huge sea [ph] change in restaurants right now in terms of how marketing is done,
and how data is becoming a more important part of all the decisions that are being
made. And really Fishbowl was the only company out there in the industry that I saw
had the potential to really lead the charge. So, it's been an exciting year and I think
there's going to be lot more exciting times to come as well.
So -- so what exactly is going on in restaurants? Well, there's major disruption that
we -- that we've been talking about, and it's really led by -- by -- by three -- by three
changes in technology, really mobile, social, and sensors is really changing
everything about how the restaurant industry operates and -- and communicates
with customers. If you think about mobile, really we're only a couple years into this
tipping point where mobile has become really prevalent way the people are -- are
using the -- the Internet, communicating and so on and so forth, really in all -- in all
parts of the economic spectrum.
So, if you think about it in terms of the -- the Internet adoption, really we're in the
very early ages of a revolution that most industries experienced almost 20 years ago.
We're a couple of years into adoption, you know, by an industry that hasn't
traditionally been very technologically savvy. Really you -- you take the mobile
because you know, this is an industry that have -- you have to be present in a certain
location in order to have the experience the social aspect, and then of course
sensors that are going to start making the hyper-local technologies become a lot
more meaningful.
Now, what what's important I think about this is that really the -- the data that it
creates when you -- when you think of the intersection of these new technologies,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-23
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 16that's really the big and the sustainable potential advantage. How are you using that
data to -- to make the messaging more relevant, more timely, more topical and
actually converted into -- into insights that will drive a competitive advantage.
And I'll talk a little bit about what I mean by this. So, one thing that's important to
understand I think about restaurants in general is the buzzwords and the -- you know
the idea of the day, you know, can catch on like wildﬁres as one successful
implementation and something than everybody is talking about the app or the
loyalty program, or the mobile payment solution or what have you.
So, now there are certainly some -- some innovators in the industry latch on to these
things early and know why they're integrating it. But really, if you think about what all
these things having in common is that we're -- we're -- we are now at a point where
we can understand and act on consumer behavior better and that's the true
evolution. It's -- the app is just a means for -- for delivering -- for delivering that
message. So what do I mean by that? So there are a couple of things that are -- that
are really changing -- changing rapidly. One is, how people consume media. And so,
if you think of, you know, just in -- in recent times, you know, what the, you know,
what the big changes are from, you know, from a really the shift from TV to -- to
digital and now -- and now to mobile.
And that's really changing -- changing how we're able to communicate with
customers both in -- in time and a place. So if we think about what that means in
terms of -- of mobile, things are changing very, very quickly. So that blue line is -- is
the amount of time people are spending per day on mobile devices. So if you see
the green line which is TV, it's still the most -- it's still the most, but it's dropping
pretty quickly. And if you compare that against print and radio and -- and -- and
desktop devices, all of them are declining and -- and mobile is continuing to --
continuing to increase.
I expect that we'll see that increasing even faster. So what that really mean -- what
that really is telling us is that the way that we're able to communicate with people
and the eﬀectiveness of -- of messaging is getting much more local. That's really a
important concept, because if you think of how many of the very large brands have
established these brands, it's really driven by TV advertising, mass media, that's very
much a -- a top-down approach to marketing and messaging. But as mobile takes
hold, we're starting to see more smaller and -- and -- and regional change and even
independents starting to really take share away from some of the large change,
because it's easier for them to -- to deploy their message locally.
So as -- so as large TV budgets become less relevant and you know, they certainly
still are relevant, but some of these localized forces are starting to -- are starting to
decrease that. So -- so what else is changing? The way -- the way that people are
making their dining decisions, so -- so when we think about things being contextual,
you know, we think about, say for instance Amazon and what Amazon has done
online. They've got a -- they -- if you go and -- and look at something, they see what
your -- what your search history was, they think about, you know, what other people
have purchased. So, when you buy a pair of hiking boots, and they've suggested,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-23
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 16you buy a pair of socks with that, it doesn't feel like spam, it feels very contextually
relevant to you. What's happening in restaurants is that, we're trying to ﬁgure out
how to actually take that context and deliver it in the time and the place with the
correct message to the right audience.
So if we think about all the diﬀerent ways that, that can be disseminated, you know,
then you start to get into something this context rich. That's going to be extremely
important as these hyper-local technologies start to take hold when -- when you're
able to message people at a very local level speciﬁc in time and message because
when your mobile phone starts to buzz to say there is a message for you, it better be
contextually relevant or you're going to be turned -- or you're going to be turned oﬀ.
Those who can -- who can crack -- crack this code, are going to be very successful at
the -- from the bottom up and that's going to start to trump I think the -- the top-
down approach of the -- of mass media.
So -- so let's think a little bit about, you know, how this ﬁts into, how consumers are
making decisions. I think this is a really important concept, it was really introduced by
McKinsey & Company, I think it was 2008 or 2009. Harvard Business Review did
another -- another iteration of it around 2000 -- just a few months after McKinsey
came and hold it. But basically they did a study exploring how people are -- are
making decisions. It used to be that the theory was that there was a decision spiral
where you basically just go through all the diﬀerent potential options and then you
settle on one once you've done this objective criteria.
What this study said was that, everybody starts with an initial consideration set, but
now the information is more available, consumers are doing this active evaluation
stage. In, you know, decades ago, you might have just done this kind of research on
a car, but now that it's present and it's available in a timely -- timely way, take like a
Yelp for instance in restaurants or any -- any number of -- of -- of mobile apps that
will tell you, you know, what the potential experience rating is. So, this is becoming a
more important part of how people are deciding what their -- what their purchase
decision is going to be.
What's important about this is that, if you understand that people are going to go
through this stage and you target the right types of messaging into -- into the -- into
a purchase catalyst, so for instance when you know people are going to social media
or they're doing some online research, how do you make sure that you're -- you're
catalyzing that purchase in a way that's -- that's relevant.
The point of purchase is becoming more important as well in restaurants, really point
of purchase and that enjoy bond and advocate stage really happen simultaneously.
So in -- right after or during a dining experience, you are most likely to -- to advocate
-- advocate for that -- for that brand. And if -- if it's a positive experience, and -- and
really at the end of the -- at the end of the experience is going to determine whether
you go into this loyalty move or whether you go back into the consideration set.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-23
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 16What's happening right now in the industry is that a lot of -- a lot of the targeted, say
the things that people are calling targeted and localized marketing is really just a
diﬀerent iteration of what their TV and radio and mass media strategy would be just
being pushed out not necessarily being customized at that local level.
Currently about 70% of the marketing spend is going into this initial consideration
set. So when people are talking about, you know, yes we're doing an app, and yes,
we're doing loyalty, and yes, we're doing email and SMS and -- and -- and all of
these new technologies, it's not just whether they've got it, it's whether they're
deploying it correctly.
And in order to deploy it correctly, there needs to be a solid data analysis behind --
behind what's going on. You can't just come out with a shell of an app and just start
disseminating single messaging, the way that you would with mass media. So -- so if
we think about how you put a strategy together behind -- behind a program like this.
So going beyond, say, apps and the technology themselves, but what do you think --
when we think about a total program?
So, yes, our minimum requirements, you know, if you think of -- of -- of an app, really
again going back in time to maybe 1998, when the Internet started to really take
hold, really every business out there started to have to build a -- a webpage of some
sort, right. It was really just the way of getting -- getting in the game and making your
presence known online.
Right now there is a similar thing with apps, right. So -- so you -- you need to -- you
need to be able to have an app, but really it's -- the engine that's behind it, that's
going to decide whether it's sustainable or whether it's just going to have to be
replaced by another app down the road. The minimum requirements really I think for
a successful, say, app, I mean ﬁrst of all, it has to be, you know, the user experience
has to be easy.
There needs to be an ordering component, a payment component, it needs to
enable loyalty, it doesn't necessarily have to have structured loyalty. Loyalty is a huge
buzzword right now. But loyalty in terms of how we thought about it in airlines and
structured programs and so on and so forth, that's traditionally been more a means
of -- of making sure that we get -- we can get information about customers and act
on it. So -- so loyalty, we need to be very careful about how we're using it because it
can -- it can -- it can be a double-edged sword. Also a -- a -- a robust customer table,
right. So once you put all this together, you know, the engine behind it at a minimum
has to be some good solid information about who that customer is.
Now, if you start thinking about really a complete solution, it really gets into -- into
depths of data, being able to not just collect the sign up information the -- the
customers -- that customers had, but actually being able to collect more meaningful
user data, right. Who -- who are those, who are those people who -- who are -- who
are coming in to dine.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-23
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 16Multiple means of future contact, right. So, you know, in a loyalty app for instance if --
if it's just a single purpose, and the only way that you've got to communicate with
people is through that loyalty app, you know, really -- you know, really limiting the --
the -- the potential for -- for how you can target people in -- in diﬀerent stages of the
decision -- of the decision journey.
The data needs to be used to provide insights, this seems obvious, I think for
anybody who does -- who makes database decisions, but an industry that's not
necessarily used to this kind of an approach. A lot of the apps that you'll see there,
out there as you look under the hood, they're not really necessarily using the data in
a meaningful way to help provide more insights and -- and -- and a -- and a better --
and better messaging, many of them are still just single -- are single message across
multiple segments.
Another important part I think is that the consumer data needs to be restaurant-
owned and portable. When you -- when -- when they are building a program, it's an
important question to -- to ask them because there are some solutions out there that
will give you an expensive say, loyalty program or what have you. But if you try and
get out of that long-term contract, you're going to lose that information about your --
about your customers. So that's a really important part in -- in understanding what a -
- what a program should be.
Because a lot of the solutions, if you think back in the -- the migration and the
evolution of, say, really the -- the Internet and online retail and so on and so forth.
The -- the same players and the same solutions that are exist right now are not
necessarily going to be the same ones in ﬁve years. So -- so in order to make this a
dynamic evolving program, it's really important that the restaurant -- the restaurant
company be able to own that -- own that data.
Beacon and WiFi integration, this is really important. This is a little bit -- a little bit of a
fast-forward. Beacon Technology hasn't really taken hold yet in a -- in a meaningful
way, but it's going to become a very important part of the -- of the in-store and
surrounding store experience for restaurants. So -- so solutions that are not able to
integrate Beacon and WiFi are not set up for -- for -- for what -- what the future is
going to -- going to bring.
Time and proximity triggers are beyond important. So if you think of really the -- the
biggest predictors in terms of being able to catalyze a purchase from -- from a
customer, it's -- it's making sure that you are -- that you are -- you're getting them at
the right time, and in the right place.
In restaurants, if the customer is not in a proximity, where they can actually get to
your restaurant at the meal-time, then they're not a viable -- they're not a viable
target. Time is also extremely important, right. You need to understand if your
concept and if your target is making a planned decision a couple of days ahead for
date night or what have you or if it's a spontaneous purchase, they're just going to
purchase a lunch when and where it's available.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-23
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 16Purchase history tracking by customer, also extremely important. There are a lot of
chain restaurants out there, they still don't have uniform point-of-sale systems. They
don't have a uniform PLUs. So it's -- so in order for them to be able to really track
what people have purchased, there are still a long way from being able to -- to
harness that data. This is an extremely important part of making sure that it's -- its --
its part of the -- its part of the plan.
Behavioral segmenting is a lot diﬀerent from say psychographic segmenting. And
most of the industry will talk about segmenting, they'll talk about how they use
diﬀerent psychographic buckets and so forth, which is really a mass media tool.
Behavioral segmenting is much more speciﬁc to understanding how people have
purchased, when they're making decisions, what they like and what's actually and
how they actually use -- use brands.
Very similar in terms of how -- how it can be collected and -- and used, but a very
important distinction. Context relevance is hugely important, as I was talking about
with the -- with the Amazon example. If you're sending people messages that are not
relevant for the time and the place, you're going to be shutdown and you're not
going to have another opportunity to interact with those people.
Message automation is also a really important part of it, not all messages necessarily
need to be automated, but some of -- but if you're able to set a message, so that is
launching to the right group of customers at the right time, then -- then --t then
you're going to have an edge on it, I think most of the -- most of the programs that
are out there. Also in-store ready, we've seen very little so far about how technology
is -- is -- is being deployed inside restaurants, but this is going to become a more
important part, I think as we go forward in terms of making that experience more --
more meaningful and tailored to the customer. So any program that's being
launched needs to make sure that -- that part of the vision and part of the -- the -- the
capabilities to be able to plug in some of the in-store solutions.
So when we just think about a simple app, really that the simpler it is the better. You
know, the -- the -- the crucial components and right now, there's a little bit of a mash-
up that needs to go through, because there are very few companies that are able to
deliver order payment rewards, multiple channels, communication fees and
behavioral analytics. And again, the most important part is in the context marketing
component, it all needs to be able to feed into this data so that you can -- you can
deploy context relevant marketing.
So -- so if we think about a couple of -- of examples in industry, really you can't talk
about technology and particularly loyalty and apps without talking about -- without
talking about Starbucks. Really, you know, they were the ﬁrst successful restaurant
loyalty app. It includes really payment structured rewards, there's surprise and
delight sort of component, as well as -- as well as stored value. What's -- what's
important to -- to know about Starbucks, it's not just what they are doing, but also
how other concepts you'd really use them is the gold standard, just sort of follow
what they're doing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-23
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 16But they need to be extremely cautious on this, because Starbucks is a little bit
diﬀerent, it's a extremely high frequency business. So -- so some of the loyalty --
loyalty components make a lot of -- a lot of sense.
There's also I think a misconception that -- that -- that people are signing up just for
the loyalty program in those structured rewards. If you think about how the -- the
Starbucks app has actually played into making that experience more -- more
palatable for -- for most customers, that's really the big advantage that we see with --
with what Starbucks have.
So -- so I think that -- so -- so when we think about also, you know, in the past few
months when -- when Starbucks said okay, well, we sort of have to walk back that
structured rewards component, right. That speaks volumes about, you know, how
they originally started up say this loyalty program, put into structured rewards,
because if this -- because -- and I think for future adopters, it really -- it really tells us
about what those future -- if it's -- to take another -- another look at whether the
structured rewards and the loyalty type of program is ﬁrst of all necessary, but also
what the potential economic consequences are of say, making a reward that's too
rich, because then you may be just giving stuﬀ away for free the people who are
going to come in anyway. Along those lines, you know, Chili's and you know, they --
they say that -- that the -- you know, their app and their -- I guess their loyalty
program is actually, they've got lots of sign-ups and they are very happy with what
the progress is.
But recall back in August 15, they attributed almost a point in -- in sales drop to their
loyalty rollout. They gave a number of diﬀerent reasons, some of it was that it took
attention away from -- from upselling inside the restaurant, some of it had to do with
roll -- pulling back on some other types of -- of rewards and discounting that they
were doing simultaneously. But it all speaks to making sure that when a company is
announcing that they're going to be doing a new app or rolling out a new
technology that they've done the math to understand what the potential
consequences are.
What I've seen in a lot of loyalty rollouts is that there is this assumption that loyalty,
that they do a loyalty that means they can stop doing other channels. But the truth is,
that there's only a certain fraction of your customers who are going to opt into a
loyalty program. There are some people who want to be communicated through text
messaging and some who would hate that. There are some who want to be
contacted through email. So -- so it's really important to understand that when you --
when you start looking at these new paradigm -- this new paradigm, that you're
thinking about it in terms of multiple channel and not making the assumption that
one of these channels can replace the others.
I think you know, yet -- yet to be seen is -- is what -- what KFC is going to be coming
up with, but from -- from what they've been saying about what their approach is, I
think it's -- I think it's encouraging. When Chris Caldwell in -- in a -- in an article
recently was -- was -- was stating that, you know, what I see with a lot of QSRs is this
me too, meaning that, you know, they see -- they see an app that works or a programFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-23
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 16that works for somebody else and then they just adopt it and assume that is right for
their customers. And designing the technology that the customer experience and
not the other way around is an extremely important part of -- of making sure that this
is -- that any program is -- is successful and future-proof.
I'll be interested to see what their program is as -- as they -- as they start to get more
speciﬁc about it, but I think as they talk about, you know, identifying what those
speciﬁc pain points are for their customers and not just say as -- as you said a ﬂash, I
think that's going to be a really important part in -- in deﬁning what a successful
program is. So -- so really just to -- to -- to summarize what -- what we've been talking
about is that companies that are going to leverage the data, right, not just
implement a new technology, but companies that implement the data and leverage
that to understand their customers are going to be the ones that -- that are really
adapting to a changing customer experience.
I would also say that a longer view on how to continually improve and act on the
data is going to be really the diﬀerence between what sustainable and what's short-
term. If you're just implementing an app and it's not tied into the data, then -- then
you're missing -- you're missing a ton of opportunity to really learn more about your
customer and how to better compete against -- against an industry that's pretty
saturated right now.
I would also say be weary of -- of homegrown solutions, that's not to say that, you
know, that they can't be successful. Certainly, you know, Starbucks homegrown
solution, you know, proved to be one of -- one of the best that are out there. But
when you think about smaller chains, you don't have the kind of funding that the
Starbucks does to be able to grow and support and really create something from
scratch, that's not something the most of the industry can actually do on their own.
So, be cautious about which -- which of these companies that say that they're going
to grow their own solution and then support it, once they invest in that, let's not
forget about how they're going to need to fast-forward and -- and -- and -- and adapt
to evolving -- evolving programs.
And speaking of evolving, I love this quote from -- from Darwin, and I think it's
extremely relevant in where we are with restaurants right now. "It's not the strongest
of species that survives, not the most intelligent that survives, it's the -- it's the one
that is the most adaptable to change". What we are seeing in restaurant and
restaurant technology and restaurant marketing is really a sea change in how people
use restaurants, and how restaurants are able to -- are -- are able to compete.
The whole -- the whole practice of -- of marketing and in a lot of ways operations is --
is -- is changing -- is changing very, very rapidly. So this is not a question right now
of, you know, if you will adopt a new approach, it's really a question of when they will
adopt, because if they don't -- if they don't do it themselves, they'll eventually be
forced.

Thanks, Mike. That was great. Now we're going to move on to the Q&A portion.
Please ask questions using the Q&A panel to the right of the slides. And we'll just
jump right in while -- while we're waiting for some questions to come in. I'll start with
a couple of my own. So ﬁrst, Mike, how -- how many restaurant -- restaurant apps will
the average person download? And can casual chain, dining chains like Chili's
overcome the inherent advantage that high frequency chains likes Starbucks and
Dunkin' Donuts have?
Yes. So, I think there's been a lot of diﬀerent research studies on how many apps,
and I think the -- the -- the range that we're seeing is somewhere between three and
ﬁve are actually going to get used after the -- after they're downloaded. So -- so I
think that -- that -- that speaks, you know, volumes about how -- how all of this is
going to -- is going to evolve, because if -- if everybody is ﬁghting for those three to
ﬁve apps, then there might be -- there must -- there needs to be something very
special in that to -- to make sure that it's -- that it's worthy of downloading a music.
I think it also tells us that what's going to happen is that all of these programs are
going to eventually have to have the ability to work interchangeably with -- with
other mobile channels. So whether there is integratability with more used apps, you
know, like Facebook, you know, and some of the other most used apps that are on
people's mobile devices in order to be able to communicate with them better.
I would say that, you know, casual dining I think is in a little bit of a -- of a conundrum.
One of the reasons is that there's been so much focus on -- there's been so much
focus on discounting. And if you're just using your app and you're just using this
technology to push out more discounts, then you're really missing this contextual
point of -- of being able to get to a broader audience who is actually looking for
something to enhance their experience and looking for a message that's actually
something that's targeted towards the app.
On -- on average, you know, we see that, you know, maybe 10% of -- of customers
are really in that high responsiveness to -- to discount in -- in -- in the restaurant
industry. So I think that, you know, casual diners really need to think more about what
are those other attributes that people are thinking about their brand and choosing
on to be able to message them in the right -- in the right time, in the right place.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Great. Thanks. Also it seems to be pretty important for restaurants to know their
customers and to use that knowledge for targeted marketing and menu
construction. So what -- what change can you point to that seem to be doing this
well right now?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-23

Page 11 of 16A - Michael Halen
A - Mike LukianoﬀI think that there are, you know, certainly, you know, certainly Starbucks, I think is, you
know, is one of those that, you know, as -- as we talked about a little bit that, you
know, has gotten the best app. What I don't know and I don't have a visibility into is
how well they are using the data, you know, I don't -- as somebody who has the app,
I don't necessarily see that the oﬀers that I'm getting are -- are particularly relevant,
right. I'd say the same with Panera, great app and I think a great -- great idea around
how it enhances the -- the experience, but in terms of what those oﬀers are that
actually end up, you know, being put into, say the loyalty program, it tells me that
maybe the data is not being used as well as it should.
I think what's -- what's interesting about, you know, and this is I think a really
important point in how people use -- use the technology that's relevant for who they
are. If you take a Panera and you say, okay, I can skip the cashier and I can skip that
cattle -- cattle call and go sit down at my table and place an order and it will come to
me, I've just enhanced my customer experience and I potentially even increased my
-- my pricing power by having a better experience.
You take the exact same thing and you put it into casual dining, Bar and Grill, and
you haven't actually enhanced the experience necessarily, you know, you've got a
diﬀerent experience and you've been paying a little bit more to walk in and to be
waited on.
So when you start to think about how the technology is working if you're just using it
to decrease the number of waiters you've got on -- on the ﬂoor, then you may have
actually severeded [ph] yourself and just commoditized yourself down to, you know,
really the level of -- of a -- of a fast casual.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yes, great. So what have been the most eﬀective uses of technology and social
media that have basically generated restaurant traﬃc or created, you know, a large
response by consumers?
That's a good question. I think that -- and maybe I'll answer it a little bit diﬀerently. I
mean, we see how important social media is becoming. And -- and -- and the reason
is being -- is being -- becoming important is that, you used to be able to just put a
brand name on a business. If you go back to the early days of say branding in -- in --
in restaurants, only the ﬁrst real successful brand with Howard Johnson's, and you
know, coast-to-coast what they were known for was a clean bathroom, right. And that
was suﬃcient, you know, in the 1970s to be able to get people to come in and say I'm
driving a cross country and I know that there is going to be a clean bathroom, right,
and that was meaningful enough.
And you could put all of your brand power, you know, brand might behind that, you
know, that it's going to -- that that's going to catalyze the behavior. You know,
McDonald's then started getting, you know, really more sophisticated thing. We got
the exact same product, you know, and it's not going to -- it's not -- you're not going
to get food poisoning, it's not going to make you ill, it's going to be the sameFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-23

meaningful in being able to make brands worth their salt. What we're seeing now is
that people aren't looking to the advertisement to say, this is a brand that has
meaning, they're looking to social -- social and reviews and all these other inputs to
help them make a decision on what local -- what local chain or what the -- what the
local options are that are actually going to be the -- the -- the best for you.
Not a lot of people stand outside of the Chili's, open up their -- the Yelp app and try -
- to see what the -- what the rating of that Chili's are. They are more apt to be looking
and saying well what's the local joint that's actually going to give me a better
experience that might -- that I might enjoy more for the same price or even more.

Great. You've [ph] to see if the restaurants full without actually drive and a walk-in

Absolutely, absolutely.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
So what kind of ROI is typical of these technology product -- projects which
companies -- and which companies have the biggest head-start and which are
maybe the biggest laggers right now?
I would say that, you know, certainly the ones that have the head-start, right, you look
at the Panera's, and you look at the Starbucks, and -- but I -- I would not -- I would not
discount the ones that have nothing out there yet, because I think that the -- the
pioneers in this area created a good user experience, but aren't necessarily creating
something that's going to be easily adaptable to new technologies.
So I think that some of the -- some of the players out there who actually have not
rolled out anything yet have the opportunity to leapfrog into a new generation.
Beacon is going to be an extremely important, Beacon and WiFi to get this hyper-
local component. It is going to be extremely important and we're going to see that
the next generation of, say, you know, apps and programs and technology is -- that's
going to be an embedded -- an embedded component.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yes. And the ROI piece, you're speaking before, I mean, how much of it is to actually
generate an ROI versus, you know, we need to do this to -- to survive?
Yes. That's a great question. I think that the mentality of restaurants has always been
the technology is something to reduce cost. And that's a really dangerous place toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-23

A - Mike Lukianoﬀcome from right now, because really these new technologies are about driving
demand, right, expanding who your audiences and who your potential audience can
be.
It's -- it's kind of funny because the same people who are talking about, you know,
tell me what your ROI on your mobile app program or what your loyalty or what have
you. They never really ask what's your ROI on your -- on your TV set, right. And a lot
of them don't have any idea of what that ROI is. I know, because we do a lot of -- lot
of that work for a lot of chains. But -- but I think that -- and that's not to say that you
don't need to have a long-term ROI, but the truth is, if you don't have a workable
program, you're going to be a relevant in -- in -- in a matter -- in a matter of -- of
years. Your -- you know the way that you do things now is going to steadily [ph]
become less eﬀective. So you either need to ﬁgure out what your strategy is to get
into the fold or you're going to be dragged there, kicking and screaming and you're
going to ﬁnd yourself at a -- at a real severe disadvantage.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yes. So like a restaurant remodel, you know, it's nice to have an ROI, but its cost of
doing business at this point?
Absolutely.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Can you speak to the strengths and weaknesses of behavioral targeting versus
psychographic targeting, any best practices in behavioral targeting you like to speak
up?
Yes, absolutely. I think, you know, psychographic targeting if you really think of the
basis for it, right. If you go back to -- it's -- it's -- it's really formulated in -- in the idea
of, I've got TV or radio, so and making a single message is extremely expensive. So
I'd better make sure that whenever message that goes on air can target my top call
it, you know, one, two, ﬁve buckets of people, right, and that's how I'm going to
create my creative, that's how I'm going to make sure that I'm on the right shows and
so on and so forth.
Now -- and it's -- it's extremely valuable in -- in that context of being able to really
roll-up and target a few number of -- of -- of types of customers. Where it starts to fall
apart is when you say, okay, well, what if I don't, what if tailored messaging is not
really the big expense, right. What if I can develop 20 diﬀerent messages or 40
diﬀerent messages for diﬀerent -- diﬀerent types of buckets, then how the
psychographic messaging actually help me do that?
And the answer is it becomes a lot less meaningful. When we talk about behavioral
targeting, this requires purchase data, right. So you're actually looking at how peopleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-23

A - Mike Lukianoﬀhave purchased things, you're -- you're using multiple means to collect information
about who they are, you know, where they live, what are the types of brands they're -
- they're frequenting, and what sorts of products they like, right, both from their
actual purchase behavior, also from any kinds of surveys that they would ﬁll out,
through integration with social media as well, by you know, tracking -- you know,
tracking their likes and dislikes on Yelp and -- and so forth.
So these -- these ways of actually knowing what your customer is actually likes and
has purchased, that's going to be a much more meaningful than just knowing that,
you know, they are in a bucket of, you know, grandma's with shock guns and pick-up
trucks.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
All right, Great. Can you comment on the strategy Chipotle is using presently? And
do you have a point of view on their loyalty their apps strategies and -- and likely
successes?
Yes, I don't really have any -- any insight into -- into Chipotle.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Okay. So next one, why would a consumer need an app for a lower frequency
purchase restaurant not Starbucks? So, don't you think an aggregator app like Yelp
or GrubHub will win the whole market all the time?
You know, I think that -- this is a really good question, because I think that it's -- it's
pretty loaded. I think it comes back to understanding what the experience is, right.
So for a lower frequency depending on -- on how low frequency, you need to make
sure that state that whether we call it an app or the technology and to me this gets
into less about the actual app, right, and more into the technology and the -- and --
and the means for collecting customer information.
We work with some ﬁne dining restaurants and the way that -- that -- that they are
using this is not say structured loyalty, but to actually know that this type of customer
or this speciﬁc customer when they come and they love this bottle of wine, they
always buy this bottle of wine, right, or they come in for the chef's tasting meal.
When you then message them and say well we've got a special event with the
celebrity chef, we'd love for you to come, right, or even a celebrity chef inspired,
we're doing a, you know, this is the ﬁrst time, we're going to roll-out our potential,
you know, new menu roll-out for the spring, you know, we're saving you a spot at the
chef's table, right.
That's the -- the -- the other spectrum, but it speaks to -- to a diﬀerent type of a
customer. You know, the -- the problem with adopting a Starbucks like app if it's not
appropriate for your -- for your situation is that I think exactly to the point now you'veFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-23

A - Michael Halengot something that's not going to -- not going to make sense. In aggregator app, I
think is a -- I think that I agree with the premise, I'm not necessarily sure that an
aggregator app, because this needs to be in two directions.
Right now restaurants want their own app, they don't like being bucketed with a
bunch of -- with a bunch of others. You know, if we think of a GrubHub the dollars
and cents that the restaurants have to pay to GrubHub, is a detractor for a lot of the
larger chains to be able to get on-board. So I think that we're going to see this in
some of the business models are either going to change or there's going to be
some new players start to emerge that will allow the restaurant to both have their
own proprietary app for a small percentage of their customers who will actually use
it, but it's integratable, we will say a -- a broader, you know, call it aggregator app
that, you know, that -- that actually has more potential breadth.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Great. And any recommendations on how to stay on top of the most powerful trends
and evolutions in the industry, so Darwin will be proud?
Yes. Data, data, and data. You know, it's, you know, great that, you know, that people
can roll-out, you know, it's actually full-featured apps and you know, in-store, you
know, table-side technology and that kind of stuﬀ. But I want to know what they are
doing with the data because at the end of the day as the actual front-end technology
well either integrates into an aggregator or merges into some other apps where the
next customer facing technology takes -- takes hold.
The one thing that's sustainable is the knowledge of who your customer is and if the
whole program is built around with understanding of who that customer is, how to
target them and making that richer over time, then you've got something that's --
something that's sustainable.
