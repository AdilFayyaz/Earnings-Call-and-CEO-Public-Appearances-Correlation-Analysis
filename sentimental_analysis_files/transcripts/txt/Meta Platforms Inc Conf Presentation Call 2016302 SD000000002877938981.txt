Presentation
Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our keynote presentations on
Wednesday of the conference here. Before we get started, I have a series of risk
disclosures I have to read through. Please note that important disclosures, including
my personal holdings disclosures and Morgan Stanley disclosures, all appear as a
handout available in the registration area and on the Morgan Stanley public website.
We have Facebook here, which we are delighted about. But before we get started,
on behalf of Facebook, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that
during the course of this conversation, David or Dan may make forward-looking
statements regarding future events and the business strategy and prospects of
Facebook.
Facebook cautions you to consider the important risk factors that could cause actual
results to diﬀer materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These risk
factors are described under the caption Risk Factors in Facebook's annual report on
Form 10-K ﬁled with the SEC on January 28, 2016.
In addition, please note that any forward-looking statements that David or Dan make
are based on assumptions as of today. And Facebook undertakes no obligation to
update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
We are delighted to have Facebook with us today. We have both the CFO, David
Wehner, as well as Dan Rose, the Vice President of Partnerships. First on David, prior
to becoming the CFO in June of 2014, Dave served as Facebook's Vice President of
Corporate Finance and Business Planning. Before joining Facebook, he was also the
CFO of Zynga and prior to that he was also a managing director at Allen & Company,
an investment bank focused on media and tech. Thank you. So much for joining us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-02

Dan RoseDan is the Vice President of Business Development and Monetization at Facebook.
He's responsible for Facebook's worldwide strategic partnerships and M&A. As head
of product marketing for the Company's monetization eﬀorts, Dan also leads
marketing strategy for all of the advertising products that you see on Facebook.
He joined Facebook in 2006 after seven years at Amazon.com where he worked on
a lot of diﬀerent projects in business development including where he helped to
incubate and develop the Amazon Kindle. He earned a bachelor degree at Harvard
University and also attended the University of Michigan for one year and I'm very
happy about that as a fellow Wolverine.
{BIO 16500367 <GO>}
Before I dropped out.
Before he dropped out he was also a Wolverine. Thanks for joining us both you guys.
This is great.
{BIO 16500367 <GO>}
Thanks for having us.
So I want to start with you, Dan. So you are Head of Partnerships, Head of
Operations. I guess a couple questions. What does that mean? What do you do?
Then how does your team help build the overall Facebook platform and where it's
going for the next three to ﬁve years?
{BIO 16500367 <GO>}
Sure. So there's kind of three functional roles here. There is the partnership function
which I will describe in a second, M&A and then operations is the word we use to
describe our customer support team, which is very diﬀerent from the other two
functions. But also an interesting challenge when you have over 1.5 billion customers
that you are supporting.
I like to kind of describe what we do in the lens of our framework around our core
business, some of the new businesses that we are building and then the long-term
innovation eﬀorts that we have.
The core business which is the Facebook app itself, there's a few diﬀerent ways that
we contribute to that through our partnership eﬀorts. One is our media partners who
publish content to Facebook, whether that is videos or news articles or celebrities
who are publishing into Facebook.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-02
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)

Dan RoseWe also distribute our app through mobile platforms obviously. That's the way most
people get our application. And so our relationship with mobile companies, whether
it is the carriers or the manufacturers, or the companies that build the operating
systems, those are all really important partnerships to us as well. Then we have a
developer ecosystem that we also manage around the partnership function.
In addition, obviously, the customer support piece of the Facebook application
where we have so many people using the app and at times needing help is another
really important part of what we do.
In terms of our next generation of products, these are new services like Instagram,
our messaging products, WhatsApp and Messenger. Some of our nascent new areas
that we are investing in like video or Facebook at Work, many of those have
components that will rely on media partnerships. Instagram, for example, a lot of the
content there comes from public ﬁgures and so we work to help them with that.
We support some of the work they are doing in commerce, some of the very early
work there around our messaging eﬀorts and our partnerships with payment
companies. And Facebook at Work is a very new product that we are just investing in
now. But my team is the team that's out talking to companies about adopting
Facebook at Work. And if there is anyone here that's interested, let me know. It's a
really exciting new product that we're building.
Then lastly on our long-term innovation eﬀorts, we have three pillars there. We have
our eﬀort to connect everyone in the world through Internet.org. And that's very
much a mobile partnership-centric eﬀort for us. We were just in Barcelona last week
at the Mobile World Congress talking to all of the global operators about that; our
eﬀort to understand the world through AI. And then our investments in VR and AR.
And across all of these, obviously, we've done diﬀerent M&A that supports each of
the diﬀerent stages of growth of the diﬀerent businesses that we are in. But that's
kind of a way to think about what my team is responsible for.
You are a very busy man. One of the speciﬁc products you mentioned that we get a
lot of questions around is video. So can you just kind of talk about Facebook's video
strategy. And how do partnerships kind of play a role in bringing more and more
video consumption on the platform?
{BIO 16500367 <GO>}
Sure. Video is really exciting. I'm a surfer. So I love to talk about this through the lens
of surﬁng. And I'm not a great surfer, I'm an amateur. But I know -- one thing about
great surfers if you watch or surf yourself is that they do two things really well.
Obviously, the ﬁrst is that they ride a wave exceptionally well. But the other thing
that's not as obvious is that they're really good at picking which wave to ride. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-02
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)
Page 4 of 18Unidentiﬁed Participant
Dan Rosethe best surfers who win the competitions wait for the right waves and then get up
on those.
And I think for Facebook, the story of the last few years has very much been about us
riding the wave of mobile and smartphones. And we were a little bit late actually to
identifying that wave kind of famously. But once we got up on it, I think we have
been riding it very well.
And video we think is another really big wave that's coming. And it's early still. But
we are investing a lot into it. We think it could be almost as big as the mobile wave
that we've been on for the last few years. There is obviously a lot happening around
video and the convergence of video in mobile devices.
So you are seeing this already in just the amount of video content that is showing up
in people's News Feeds now, as we've kind of evolved as a service from starting out
as a text-based service to photos being the predominant media type, to now video
becoming much more of a predominant media type.
And we are investing in new ways for people to consume video like our suggested
videos tests that we are running, which we can get into more. We are also
experimenting with some new formats around video like Live, which we are also
really excited about and we can talk about more as well. But in general, video is
deﬁnitely a big wave and we are focused on really taking advantage of it.
Then kind of the partnerships with content players or celebrities, how do you think
about the video product evolving over time; whether it is Live or even just the
standard streaming product?
{BIO 16500367 <GO>}
So I think one of the big innovations that we've done over the last year in audio is
autoplay and News Feed and this idea that when you are scrolling through your feed
and a video appears, that it can just start playing in line without having to click play.
And that has really led to an explosion in the amount of video that people are
consuming. And as a result, people who create video content have taken notice of
that.
And the video contact that we see in News Feed today is video that for the most part,
people want to get out to a large audience. Facebook has a huge customer base
and they want people to see what they are producing. And typically, the motivation
for that is going to be that you have something that you want people to see because
it is going to lead to some other behavior than you can ultimately make money from
or get some other result from.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-02

Dan RoseSo Jimmy Fallon publishes his clips from his show because they want people to tune
into The Tonight Show. The NBA publishes highlights from their games because they
want people to go to the games or watch the games. Celebrities might publish
because they want to build a big following so that when they get endorsements,
they can sell that social media following to their sponsor.
So News Feed, there is a really nice alignment of incentives where great content
comes in. Consumers love that because they love to consume that content. I mean
some of the best content we have seen recently has been around the election from
the candidates. They have obviously motivations for wanting that to be seen by a lot
of people. Then Facebook beneﬁts because people spend more time in News Feed
consuming that.
The thing we have heard and that we are starting to experiment now is that in
addition to getting their content in front of a lot of people, many of these media
partners would like to be able to make money on Facebook. And we are just now
starting to experiment with nascent ideas for how we could do that.
The two that we have done so far publicly are instant articles, where publishers can
have their content hosted on Facebook. That enables us to load the articles more
quickly, which eliminates one of the big friction points on mobile. Then they can sell
the ads into the content and keep the revenue, or they can use Facebook Audience
Network and share their revenue with us.
Then secondly, we have suggested videos where it's just a feed of videos. So if
you're in your News Feed, you're seeing videos along with photos and other things.
But if you just want to consume video, we have a new surface and suggested videos
where you can just watch videos. And there's ads there and we share some of the
revenue there with our partners who publish into that.
So historically, we have had a really nice alignment around News Feed. And now we
are exploring new ways to drive alignment around monetization as well.
Got it. This is probably a question for either one of you. I know you mentioned M&A,
are involved in M&A. And M&A has certainly been kind of part of the way you've
been riding those waves. It's almost like you've been opportunistically strategic in
some of the M&A that you have done.
At a high level, talk about how Facebook analyzes M&A; what characteristics do you
look for as you look at potential M&A candidates?
{BIO 16500367 <GO>}
I'll give you kind of the framework that Dave and I and the rest of the corp dev team
use when we think about buying companies, which is kind of these four diﬀerentFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-02
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)
Page 6 of 18Unidentiﬁed Participant
David Wehnerpieces that all really need to be in place for us to feel good about an acquisition.
The ﬁrst is rationale. And this is really the critical piece of getting everybody
internally on our side aligned on why we are doing the deal. And it seems obvious.
But sometimes diﬀerent people think we are buying a company for diﬀerent reasons.
And if you don't have that alignment, it can be set up to not be successful.
The second piece is alignment with the target. And here when we are talking about
large M&A, for us it means really Mark being aligned with the CEO of the Company
we are acquiring on why it makes sense for them to join us and what the vision is for
when they are part of Facebook.
Probably the best example is WhatsApp where Jan, the founder and CEO of that
company, really didn't want to sell it. And ultimately, the reason he chose to sell to
Facebook was because he has a vision of everybody in the world connecting
through his product. And we have a mission of connecting everybody in the world.
And he and Mark really got aligned on that and realized that -- Jan realized that he
could achieve that better as part of Facebook than on his own.
The third is integration, which is kind of the least sexy part but often the most
important. And we try to strike a balance with giving companies autonomy to
continue to operate, companies like Instagram or WhatsApp or Oculus. It's really
important, these are companies that have had success before they became part of
Facebook. And the last thing we want to do is slow them down or become a barrier
to their continued success, while at the same time taking advantage of all of the
assets and the things that we can bring to help amplify their growth and success.
Then the last is the price. And that's the one that sometimes gets the most attention.
Dave certainly pays a lot of attention to it. And we all care and make sure that -- we
need to make sure that when we buy a company, we believe that there is going to be
a good ROI story behind why we would be willing to pay that price and what it's
worth. But that kind of comes last. And the other three are very important as well.
One of the bigger M&A -- I guess not even size-wise but certainly impact-wise -- has
been Instagram. Dave, where are you now in kind of the Instagram monetization
story? And I guess when you talk to advertisers or as advertisers look at the core
business versus Instagram, how are they diﬀerentiating advertising objectives
between the two of them? Then the big question is always incremental versus
substitutive ad spend.
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Yes, I would start with what Instagram brings to the table from an audience
perspective. So we've got 400 million people on Instagram that complements the 1.5
billion people on Facebook. Obviously there's overlap there. But with those, we've
got the two most important mobile audiences on the planet and I think advertisersFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-02
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)
Page 7 of 18Unidentiﬁed Participantrealize that and they've come to Facebook for good opportunities to reach those
large audiences.
They are also slightly diﬀerent in terms of how people use the product. So you are
using Facebook to connect with people that you care about the content that you
care about with public ﬁgures that you care about.
Then with Instagram, you're using it to connect but there's also visual inspiration
there. So there's a slight diﬀerence in the character of the product and we see
marketers using that when they develop content and advertisements speciﬁcally for
Instagram. So we have seen a lot of that where marketers are working within the
character and feel of Instagram and have been very successful. So we are excited to
see that.
But importantly we are also operating these on a common (ads) infrastructure. So a
marketer can come and use the same objectives. You can target website conversions
or app installs or video views across Facebook and Instagram in a consistent way
and in a measurable way that they can use the measurement across those platforms.
And that provides a great deal of leverage for those marketers.
And so, we've seen 98 of the top 100 advertisers on Facebook are advertising on
Instagram. We have got 200,000 advertisers on Instagram and now 3 million on
Facebook. We would've never gotten to that level had we not been able to leverage
the demand that we have on Facebook and brought that to Instagram.
So I think it's been really complementary and we're seeing both use cases where
people are using very speciﬁc targeting on Facebook or Instagram and where they
are going across both -- and good success across both of those. Advertisers like
Microsoft have used kind of cross-platform Shutterﬂy, a lot of good success. So we
are really liking where we are with that.
Now the question I think you had at the end was the substitution or the
(incrementality). Whenever we look at the (ads) business in terms of whether it's
bringing new demand to the ads business like video or bringing news supply to the
ads business like Instagram or Audience Network, there's always going to be some
amount of substitution eﬀect, some amount of incrementality.
So you've always got to look at that and balance that out. So there's no doubt that
when you -- especially in the near-term when you bring a bunch of supply on from
something like Instagram, some of the demand is going to shift from Facebook to
Instagram. And that's how we look at the business and model the business.
The other sizable M&A was really around WhatsApp. How does WhatsApp kind of ﬁt
into the core Facebook use case over the next two to three years? And I guess at aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-02
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)
Page 8 of 18David Wehner
Dan Rosehigh level what's the diﬀerence in the core use case between Facebook Messenger
and what you are seeing on WhatsApp?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Yes, I think there's a lot of alignment with the messaging products. But also there are
diﬀerences. In terms of what it brings to the table I would go back to what was Dan
was talking about with M&A and alignment. It's clear, when we look at the mission of
Facebook to bring people the power to connect and share, that sharing is not just
going to happen in one type of application like News Feed. It's also happening via
messaging.
And messaging platforms are core to sharing whether it's one-to-one messaging or
group messaging. And WhatsApp is very much aligned against that. So to really fulﬁll
the mission, having the best messaging products out there is really critical and we
think both WhatsApp and Messenger help us do that.
WhatsApp -- the team is squarely focused on growth. When we made the acquisition
we were very clear that the goal number one was get to 1 billion users and
WhatsApp and the team have delivered there and we're really pleased with the
results. But the focus is still on growing that user base.
Ultimately these are very large reach platforms, 1 billion on WhatsApp, 800 million
on Messenger. There is incredible distribution opportunities there, there's incredible
utility values there. So we think there's a real potential to monetize these platforms in
the long run.
How we are approaching it is looking at some of the same things we did with News
Feed, which is connecting people with businesses via News Feed liking and
following pages, connecting people with businesses in Messenger. And once we
have those organic relationships and that utility built through those platforms, we
think there is commercial opportunities that can build on that. But that's the initial
focus. We are still very early and then as we experiment and learn we will be
updating everyone on what we are ﬁnding out.
{BIO 16500367 <GO>}
I would just add to that. And this is just kind of interesting. Messenger has more of a
Facebook network in terms of who you are messaging. It is most of your Facebook
friends. WhatsApp tends to be more like SMS in your phonebook. So they're
diﬀerent in that respect.
And another way that they are diﬀerent is WhatsApp from a product perspective is
very utilitarian. There's not a lot of features. It's really just about sending messages,
whereas the Messenger team has taken an approach of adding a lot of features and
making it a more robust experience for people. So it's an interesting opportunity.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-02

David WehnerWe didn't really design it this way. But it turns out we have an opportunity to
experiment with both of these approaches and see which one long-term people
really respond to. And I think they are both growing and they are both doing well.
But it isn't yet entirely clear which of these two approaches is the right long-term
approach for this type of a product.
I know you mentioned early days in Messenger monetization and testing and things.
But do those diﬀerences in use case, does that impact at all how you think about
monetizing the two platforms long-term or (multiple speakers)?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
I will say we are certainly working on experimenting in Messenger ﬁrst. Part of the
advantage of doing that is you already have 50 million businesses connected to
Facebook and the Facebook graph. And so that very naturally ﬁts with the
Messenger product. So I think we've got some early advantage to doing
experimentation and work there on Facebook Messenger.
We do see people using WhatsApp to communicate, businesses to consumers. So
that's happening and there are some things going on there that are interesting. But I
think Messenger is the one that we are going to be focused on sooner because of
that base of small businesses that are already connected to the Facebook graph via
the big page presence that they have.
Coming oﬀ of super Tuesday and even you mentioned the elections earlier, if we
step back, what's changed from four years ago to 2016 in how the politicians --
Donald Trump has changed things -- (multiple speakers). How has it changed over
the last four years? Can you just talk about ways in which the politicians and the
super PACs are using Facebook, both earned media and paid media, what they're
doing now versus what they weren't doing? How has the product evolved?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Well I think it's very exciting, the election, certainly from Facebook's perspective
because there's lots of interesting content being generated and shared on
Facebook. It's an incredible platform for people to connect and they are connecting
with politicians. There's conversations going on amongst friends about the election
and so there's tons of interactions.
We have seen I think it's 75 million, 76 million people interact on Facebook around
the election. So there's an incredible amount of engagement going on. And we think
of Facebook as being the new Town Hall where this kind of conversation, this type of
activity is taking place. And I think we really just advanced a long way from 2012 toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-02

Dan Rose2016. We have got a lot more authentic raw content coming from the candidates on
Facebook and I think it's very powerful and quite interesting and engaging.
On the ad side, I think it's -- we just have a very diversiﬁed business from an ads
perspective. So no one vertical, whether that be politics, is going to drive the
business. But I think on an engagement side we are really excited about what we are
seeing. And Dan, (multiple speakers) you work with a lot of the public ﬁgures.
{BIO 16500367 <GO>}
Yes. It's interesting, there's no question that this election cycle, the candidates have
really taken to Facebook as a way to reach their constituents. It's also the case that
outside of the US this has been happening for a while. And even in the last cycle
Obama was famously very social media savvy and used social media better than his
opponents.
But in India, Prime Minister Modi has been connecting with his constituents and told
us that that was a key part of his election. And in Indonesia we saw the same thing.
It's been happening around the world.
One of the things that's diﬀerent about 2016 is that this new video product that
we've launched just in the last few months, the live video product where you can
broadcast out to an audience real-time via your phone and video has really taken oﬀ
with candidates and they love it.
And it's not just the candidates who are talking to their audience before they go on
stage at a debate or afterwards. It's also the pundits. You've got Newt Gingrich who's
basically got his own cable network on Facebook. He is going on after every single
debate giving his real-time analysis. You have the Univision Jorge Ramos who is
doing this from all of the diﬀerent states.
Before Super Tuesday, you had Hillary's team using Facebook live to explain to
people in caucus states how to caucus. It's a really powerful thing to be able to pull
your phone out, turn it on and immediately reach people real-time via video. And I
think that's one of the things that's really -- we launched that just as the election cycle
heated up and the convergence of those is an interesting new trend.
Yes. It's kind of like this is the -- the live this year's Ice Bucket Challenge of a year and
a half ago.
{BIO 16500367 <GO>}
In some ways, although that was a really interesting moment and it certainly
happened around the launch of autoplay. So that was something I think autoplayFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-02

Unidentiﬁed Participantvideo really exploded with the Ice Bucket Challenge. But it was also something that
peaked and then went away and other things took its place.
I think what's happening with the elections now and live and the ability to reach an
audience in real-time; I expect that that's something that will continue to expand in
other elections in other countries around the world. I think that product really lends
itself to this type of format.
As we are watching Donald Trump go state-by-state through Facebook live, how do
you think about monetizing that? Is it a standard pre-roll, post-roll? How do you think
about monetizing that?
{BIO 16500367 <GO>}
I think it is really early and we'll ﬁgure that out later. The model we've taken from the
very beginning --
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
(Multiple speakers) Jeb Bush buying ads for that (multiple speakers).
{BIO 16500367 <GO>}
That model didn't work so we'll try something else. We've always focused ﬁrst on
building these consumer products and getting them to scale and then start to think
about how we make money from them. Dave was talking about our approach to
monetizing. Our messaging products -- and that's very much kind of the mode we're
in.
We've been focused on ﬁrst building them to 1 billion users and then you think
about okay, well how do you incorporate businesses and how do you make money
from it. And that's what we did with Facebook in the early days of Facebook.
Live is -- in some respects it's just video content. And so that's something I think is
relatively well understood from a monetization perspective. On the other hand it's
diﬀerent. People tend to watch it for longer periods of time. It's real time. So there's
new aspects of it that we'll have to think about.
But we are not thinking about that right now. Right now we're just really investing in
the consumer product and making it useful to people. And if we can get that to scale
then we'll start exploring how we can monetize it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-02

Page 12 of 18David WehnerKeep investing ?; investment is always a big theme at Facebook, Dave. You laid out
OpEx and some guidance and CapEx guidance for this year. Just talk about some of
the key investment areas for Facebook as we go into 2016 and just kind of even
longer-term areas where the capital is going to be deployed.
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Yes, I think the two big areas are R&D and there it's a lot of -- it's hiring on the R&D
front and CapEx and scaling the infrastructure to support the growth of mobile and
video. So those are the two big themes. On the R&D side, it is what we've been
talking about which is a big bulk of the investment is going to grow the core
business which is funding all the teams that support the growth, the engagement,
the monetization of the core platform.
There's lots of work we can do to make our ads more eﬀective, better measurement,
bringing more advertisers into the system, continuing to invest in the News Feed
product to drive more time spent. So there's lots of investment areas and big teams
that we have working on those to just drive the core business.
So I think that's -- when we look at our R&D dollars, that's where the bulk of it's
going. Then we've got the next generation of services with Instagram which has
obviously got a lot that we are pushing on there. We've got WhatsApp, we've got
Messenger. We are building out obviously our video and search capabilities as well.
Those all take signiﬁcant investments to drive the outcomes we want to drive there.
So that's the second big chunk of investments that we have. Then ﬁnally, we've got
the longer-term investments that we are making. We are putting a lot of weight
behind those so that's Internet.org and the connectivity (labs) eﬀorts, it's Oculus and
VR and then ﬁnally it is our AI eﬀort. So we sort of look at the full spectrum of what
we are investing against those buckets on the RD side.
On the capital side, which we are seeing a big ramp up in the capital expenditure
next year -- or this year, sorry, we've got a number of data centers that we are putting
-- either expanding or bringing online. So we have got Fort Worth being built today.
We're just starting underway on our data center in Clonee, Ireland. We are
continuing to expand the data centers that we have and the footprints that those
have, bringing more servers in to place.
Then the networking investments that we are making are pretty substantial given the
amount of video that we are now moving around and things like Live and other
video products certainly bring necessity to put more bandwidth into play. So there's
big investments going on there.
So when you kind of put everything across, it is a substantial investment program.
We are very excited about the investments we are making across the core, the
medium-term and the long-term. And we think we are doing the right thing by
investing in our infrastructure to be able to handle the potential growth that we see
out there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-02

Dan RoseSo we've got a big investment program. But we are excited about it. And also we've
got a business that really puts us in a position to make those aggressive investments.
The more live -- it just takes a lot more bandwidth in the data center for all the live
video. I have a few more questions. We are going to open it up to audience Q&A
after my couple more. So if you have questions feel free to raise your hand and there
are mic runners who can bring you a mic as well.
We talked about the evolution of the platform and how there was no video and then
there was the Ice Bucket Challenge and now we're watching live videos and what
Hillary is up to today. Virtual reality is ? it's an area of investment, even Dave said it.
How does virtual-reality kind of take the platform to the next level? What does the
Facebook platform look like three years, four years down the road once we bring in
VR?

I think it is more than four years. I think VR is the kind of thing that we are investing in
on a 10-year time horizon, that's why we include it in our long-term innovation eﬀorts.
It's very, very early days. But we are investing in it. We think there are a couple of
trends that point to VR being something that will be big in the future.
One is this trend from media type text to photo to video to kind of more immersive
video like 360 video which we see on Facebook itself and we are already seeing
more and more 360 video being uploaded to the platform and that obviously in a
VR environment becomes very immersive and very engaging.
Also from a computing perspective, computers -- the sort of big long-term trend
over many decades is computers getting smaller and moving closer to our bodies. If
you think about the mainframe moving to the PC to the laptop to the cell phone.
Sort of the next logical extension of that is a computer that's actually like on your
face maybe in front of your eyes that you don't even have to pull out of your pocket.
Again, it's early days and this is something that will take many, many years if not
decades to become mainstream. But we want to invest ahead of that. We think that
this type of experience is naturally a very social one because the ability to feel like
you're in the same room with somebody who may be half a world away is very
possible with VR. And so Facebook understands social applications and we think we
can bring social experiences to that type of a platform.
And so, we bought Oculus. We have a team that is building some early VR hardware
and software. We have a PC product called the (RITH) that's going to be shipping
soon that plugs into your computer. And we have a mobile product that we
partnered with Samsung on called Gear VR.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-02

early and we're just getting started. It's probably like the Palm Treo stage, if you will,
of the mobile smartphone evolution for VR.
That's a great reference. Any questions at all. Raise your hand if you have a -- a
question in the front.
Questions And Answers
A question on video, that's clearly a focus. It seems to me that the video taking
process actually hasn't been solved yet. It's still very diﬃcult to take videos from a
just lighting and sound and then also get the relevant stuﬀ uploaded so people can
quickly see it.
All these things seem still fairly diﬃcult as just an average user as opposed to the
picture, which I think has been solved. How do you guys think about that? Is that
inhibiting the growth or you think that what we have right now in terms of hardware
and solutions for video taking is enough to make that --?
{BIO 16500367 <GO>}
Yes, I think the fact that we can launch a product like Live and already have the
amount of engagement we do is because everybody is basically now walking
around with a video camera in their pocket, which just wasn't the case a few years
ago. So from that perspective, it has come a long way and it's good enough for a lot
of people to feel comfortable posting videos to their friends or to larger audiences.
That said, absolutely there's going to be a lot of innovation and improvement there.
And to some extent I think the motivation for the manufacturers to make their
cameras better, cameras that are integrated into the phones better, is the fact that
there's now real demand for it.
When you have people like Newt Gingrich who is virtually basically now running his
own cable television show through his iPhone, he wants it to look really good and
that just wasn't necessarily a need before, to have professional grade video quality
from an iPhone.
So I think you're going to see a lot more innovation around that and we are certainly
motivated to want to encourage and support that as well. But it is at a level right now
where it's good enough for a lot of this to be happening.
Maybe another question on video, which is just the completion rates of your video in
autoplay. Is that a metric that you are optimizing towards or are you trying to maybeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-02

{BIO 16500367 <GO>}
We do publish it so we give people a sense of how far their audience is getting into
their video so that they can think about as they create new videos how to do it in
such a way that if they want people to watch for longer they can aﬀect that outcome.
That said, it is a new format and what's interesting about it is the sound isn't on when
somebody starts watching at ﬁrst when it autoplays. And a lot of times people are
watching videos for a short amount of time. And so it's almost requiring creators to
rethink what it means to produce video for this environment. And a lot of them are
getting really smart about producing shorter videos that don't require the sound to
be on to get the message across.
You have things like subtitles; you have things like really pulling the highlight of the
clip into the beginning. If you think about a movie trailer, the ﬁrst thing you see on a
movie trailer is the green screen with the ratings. Somebody sees that in their News
Feed they're just going to skip right past it. So a lot of creators are rethinking video
for this environment and we are seeing some very new cool innovative content
being created.
Can you comment on how Facebook Messenger for business is working both as a
proposition for businesses and for Facebook, the timing on which that's going to be
a meaningful part of service and support interaction between businesses and
customers?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Yes, I think we are really -- I'd characterize it as we are experimenting today on that. I
think there's some really interesting work going on there. But I think it's too early to
say when that's going to be a big impactful part of the business. There's just a lot of
utility we think we can bring to businesses.
People don't talk on the phone anymore, they connect via text. There's not a great
way for businesses and consumers to chat eﬀectively and communicate eﬀectively
and we think messaging is a great way to do that. But there's lots of work that needs
to be done there. The APIs don't exist there on the business side to be able to
connect with consumers.
So we are doing a lot of work to build and look at what we can do to be eﬀective
with establishing good connections between businesses and consumers. But it's a
lot of work. So we've got to do it, we've got to experiment with it. Like I mentioned
earlier, one of the big assets we bring to bear is we already have a lot of businesses
connected via Facebook and we see that as being an intrinsic asset for us to be able
to bring to bear to help solve that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-02

A - Dan RoseSo that's what we are doing. I think it's too early for us to kind of update on
timeframes on when there might be an impact from that. But as we learn more we
will certainly share it.
{BIO 16500367 <GO>}
I would just add quickly, I've been at Facebook for 10 years and before we had
Facebook pages we had businesses creating proﬁles and hitting a 5,000 friend limit.
And so we built a product to solve for that. And Dave mentioned earlier you have
businesses on -- especially on WhatsApp today who are kind of connecting with
consumers. But that's not really what the product was built for.
So a lot of this work is really just to enable some of the emerging use cases that are
happening and make it a better experience for people. And that obviously has a
path to being a business someday. But we are starting with how do we serve the
needs that people are expressing they want to have.
Yes. Two questions. So WhatsApp was developed in part to get around censorship in
parts of the world. So the ﬁrst is what % of the world is non-accessible to you guys
because of censorship? And because of this beginning does it mean that the
opportunity to monetize the messaging is possibly bigger than many would believe?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Obviously the biggest country where we are not -- that we are not in is China, by far
the biggest. So I think it's pretty much China, Iran and North Korea or something like
that. So China is the big part of the world that we're not connecting via the platform
today. And there there's no visibility on when it might be possible for us to be there.
But it's something that obviously -- to fulﬁll our ultimate mission we'd love to be able
to connect to people in China.
{BIO 16500367 <GO>}
In terms of the relative size of the businesses, I think what we believe, like Dave said
earlier, there's kind of this spectrum of people wanting to share. Some of it is going
to be through public posting, some of it's going to be through group, some of it's
going to be through one-to-one sharing.
Part of the reason we bought WhatsApp is we want to be able to plan all of those
and we are investing in Messenger as well for the same reason. I think it's hard to say
which of those use cases long-term is going to be bigger.
I think we're seeing a lot of growth in the core use case that Facebook has a good
position with public and group posting. And you are seeing overlap there with
group messages and the type of functionality that WhatsApp and Messenger enable
there. Then obviously there's one-to-one which is much more in the camp of
messaging platforms.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-02

and something that's going to continue to grow and we want to serve all of those
needs through the products that we can oﬀer.
I was surprised to hear you mention search is one of the investment areas. Can you
talk about your ambitions and what you're trying to do there? Thank you.
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Sure, I'll take that. Search is really about how do we enable people to discover the
content that's been shared on Facebook? The content that's been shared publicly by
everyone and then the content that's been shared by people that they are
connected with and friends they are connected with. So I think it's really about how
do we open up another avenue of engagement on Facebook.
If you can ﬁnd content that you are interested in you can use search to discover it.
Today the vast majority of what we are seeing people search for, as you would
expect, is people. That's what they're using it for. But also using that to ﬁnd content
that you care about from the people that you are connected with.
And that's going to open up another opportunity we think for just people spending
more time eﬀectively in News Feed discovering content. So it's really about how do
we just drive more engagement and utility from Facebook than it's about a search
business in how we would think traditionally about a search business.
With that, I think we are against the clock. So thank you so much, Facebook, for
coming. You guys are great, Dan, Dave.
