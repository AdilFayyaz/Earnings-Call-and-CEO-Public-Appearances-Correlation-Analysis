Good morning, everyone. It's wonderful to see all of you. On behalf of our Board of
Directors and senior management team, thank you for joining us either in person or
via webcast for PepsiCo's 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
To everyone here in New Bern, thank you for showing us once again such a gracious

Robert Pohlad, Darren Walker and Alberto Weisser. One of our board members, Dan
Vasella, is unable to be here today. And I'd be remiss if I didn't say a word about
Lloyd Trotter who is now retired from our board. Lloyd has not only been a wise
counselor during his nearly 10 years on our board, he's also been a dear friend. And
on behalf of the entire company, I want to thank him for all that he's done for
PepsiCo.
With me on stage is Tony West, Executive Vice President, Government Aﬀairs,
General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. And let me also introduce the other

to be working for all of them.
And let me also say what a privilege it is to be joined once again by Jan Calloway,
whose late husband, Wayne, a proud son of North Carolina, brought me to PepsiCo
back in the 1990s when he was CEO of PepsiCo. Jan Calloway, welcome. Thank you
for coming.
It's also wonderful to be joined again by Paul Finney, CEO of Pepsi Bottling Ventures,
our largest bottling partner in North America, as well as Jeﬀ Minges and his sons,
Miles and Landon. Jeﬀ, as you know, runs the Minges Bottling Group, our bottling
partner here in New Bern and across eastern North Carolina. Jeﬀ and Landon and
Miles, welcome. Thank you. Thank you for everything you do for our partnership.
And thanks to all of you, our shareholders, for being here and for the conﬁdence
you've placed in us with your investment. We don't take that conﬁdence for granted.
We value the chance to come here and talk about what we're doing day in and day
out to earn that conﬁdence and to meet the responsibilities to all of you.
And this gathering is particularly meaningful to me because we're here to talk about
our performance in 2016, which happens to be my 10th year as CEO. I must say it'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 12been a rather eventful decade. We've faced a range of challenges from changing
consumer preferences, to the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, to growing volatility and
uncertainty in key markets around the world. But you know what? As I reﬂect on the
past 10 years, I couldn't be prouder of what we've accomplished. We've made a
great company even greater, delivering performance that surpassed the S&P 500.
And we built that successful performance last year. We built on that successful
performance last year, once again meeting or exceeding our ﬁnancial targets.
Speciﬁcally, organic revenue grew 3.7%, in line with our goal of approximately 4%.
Core gross margins improved by 50 basis points while core operating margin
improved by 80 basis points. Core net return on invested capital improved by 190
basis points to 21.5%. Core constant currency earnings per share grew 9% and free
cash ﬂow, excluding certain items, was strong at $7.8 billion.
PepsiCo increased its annualized dividend for the 45th consecutive year beginning
with our June 2017 payment and returned $7 billion to our shareholders through
share repurchases and dividends. Our spending on advertising and marketing as a
percentage of sales increased by 40 basis points. We steadily increased our R&D
investment for more than 10 years and in 2016, R&D spending was up 45% since
2011. 2016 also marked the fourth consecutive year innovation accounted for at least
8% of our net revenue.
You know what, I'm proud of these results and I'm even prouder of the way we
delivered them, by embracing an approach we call Performance with Purpose, an
approach, a governing philosophy that guides every decision we make. At its heart,
Performance with Purpose is about securing healthy ﬁnancial returns for our
shareholders by building a healthier future for all our stakeholders. It's about
transforming our portfolio so we can oﬀer more of the healthier options consumers
want. It's about making PepsiCo more environmentally sustainable so we can lower
our energy and packaging costs but more importantly, get a license to operate in
markets around the world. And it's also about promoting a healthier planet along the
way. It's about recruiting and retaining world-class talent by fostering a healthier
workplace and building goodwill in the communities we serve by lifting people up
and lending a hand wherever we can.
Put another way, these 4 priorities: performance, our products, the planet and
people, form a kind of virtuous circle because by making healthier products,
promoting a healthier planet and investing in our people and communities, we can
continue to deliver healthy performance.
And by continuing to deliver healthy performance, we can continue to make the
investments we need to build a healthier future for all our stakeholders.
This is the approach we've taken over the past 10 years. And it has enabled us to
deliver signiﬁcant value for our shareholders just as we've been doing for decades.
In an era of accelerating change, we continue to oﬀer steady, consistent leadership
and steady, consistent returns.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 4 of 12Tony WestTo cite one example, our annualized total shareholder return since 1990 has been
11.4%. Since 2000, it's been 9.1% and since 2010, it's been 11.2%. In fact, if you've
invested -- if you had invested $100 in PepsiCo at the start of the new millennium, it
would be worth $439 today, more than twice as much as $100 invested in the S&P
500, more than twice as much as $100 invested in the S&P 500. And all of us know
that it's not just about dollars and cents, it's about lives and livelihoods. Some years
ago, we received a letter from a ﬁnancial adviser who represented a couple with
some PepsiCo stock. I'd like to read you a brief excerpt.
"To whom it may concern," the letter begins, "I believe I have an interesting story for
Pepsi, which dates back to 1958. My clients, Mr. and Mrs. Z, invested $2,413.44 in 100
shares of Pepsi on October 29, 1958, October 29, 1958. Today, the original investment
is worth $1,273,838, plus Mr. and Mrs. Z took the dividends all these years, Mr. and
Mrs. Z are still here going strong at 91 and 93.
By focusing on the business and the value of the stock, their grandchildren have
their college and future education secured."
That story captures why we do what we do at PepsiCo, the people, the shareholders,
those interests we are ﬁghting to advance each and every day. And yet, the value we
generate extends beyond the rise in our stock price. It can be measured in the
production lines of our bottlers, the orange groves and potato ﬁelds of our farmers
and growers and the shelves of our retail partners. It can be felt in the lives of the
more than 200,000 men and women I'm proud to call fellow associates who live and
work here in North Carolina, across all 50 states in our country and more than 200
countries and territories we serve around the world.
Simply put, the value we generate can be felt in the neighborhoods we call home.
You see, you're not just our shareholders, you're our neighbors, you're our friends,
you're our family. Your communities are our communities and we want to make sure
all of us can thrive. I'm proud to say that that's a standard we have felt in 2016 also.
And we've already gotten to work making sure we build on our progress in 2017.
So with these opening comments, let me turn it over to Tony West. Tony?

We have 6 agenda items this morning. The ﬁrst is the election of directors; the
second is the ratiﬁcation of the appointment of KPMG LLP as the company's
independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for ﬁscal year 2017; the third is the
advisory approval of executive compensation; the fourth is the advisory vote on the

In proceeding with the meeting, we will introduce all agenda items and then we will
open the ﬂoor to questions relating to the agenda items only. I ask you to hold all
questions on our agenda items until we actually open the ﬂoor. And please direct
your questions only to me.
The proponents of the shareholder proposals or their representatives will have 5
minutes to present each shareholder proposal. After 5 minutes, you will hear this
chime. And that's your indication the time is up.
Because we did not receive notice in accordance with our bylaws of any additional

this meeting.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 12Christopher DemetropoulosAfter we address any questions regarding the agenda items, we will collect all the
ballots and then ask our inspectors of election to tabulate the voting results. At the
end of the meeting, we will open the ﬂoor to general questions. You should have a
copy of the rules of procedure that we will follow in the conduct of this meeting. And
we appreciate your cooperation. I have asked Mr. West to address any issues that
arise under those rules.
So let's begin with our ﬁrst agenda item, which is the election of directors. I place
before the meeting, to serve as directors for the upcoming year, the 14 individuals
whose names and biographies appear in our proxy statement. Our board
recommends a vote for each of the nominees for Director.
Our second agenda item, the ratiﬁcation of the appointment of KPMG as the
company's independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for 2017, which I place
before the meeting. Doug Ruud is here with us, representing KPMG. And will be
available to answer questions or make a statement if he would like to do so later in
the meeting.
Our board recommends a vote for the ratiﬁcation and appointment of KPMG as
PepsiCo's independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for 2017.
The third agenda item is the advisory vote to approve the compensation of the
named executive oﬃcers identiﬁed in our proxy statement, which I place before the
meeting. Our board recommends a vote for the advisory resolution to approve
executive compensation.
The fourth agenda item is the advisory vote on the frequency of future shareholder
advisory approvals of executive compensation, which I place before the meeting.
Our board recommends a vote of every one year with respect to how frequently a
shareholder advisory approval of the compensation of named executive oﬃcers
should occur.
We'll now move on to the shareholder proposals in the order that they appear on
the agenda. Each of the shareholders or their representatives will present their
respective proposals.
Now we turn to our ﬁrst shareholder proposal submitted by Trillium Asset
Management LLC on behalf of Susan Meade; The Sustainability Group on behalf of
the William B. Perkins Trust; Domini Social Investments LLC on behalf of Domini
Social Equity Fund; The School Sisters of Notre Dame Cooperative Investment Fund;
The Benedictine Sisters of Baltimore; and Benedictine Sisters of Mount Saint

himself and the proposal. Chris?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 7 of 12Good morning, Ms. Chair, members of the board and fellow shareowners. My name
is Chris Demetropoulos with Trillium Asset Management, which along with The
Sustainability Group of Loring, Wolcott & Coolidge, The Benedictine Sisters of
Baltimore, The Benedictine Sisters of Mount St. Scholastica, Domini Impact
Investments and School Sisters of Notre Dame Cooperative Investments Fund, ﬁled
proxy item 5.
Representing asset owners with a commitment to integrate environmental, social
and governance issues into our stock selection process, we applaud Pepsi's
commitment to sustainable business practices and are pleased to be shareowners.
However, we believe the company has not adequately addressed the impacts that
pesticide use in the supply chain can have on humans and health of the pollinators.
Because of this deﬁciency in Pepsi's actions and reporting, I hereby move this
proposal, which asks the company to report on strategies and options they can take
to protect against risk by tracking and reducing the amount of pesticides used in its
supply chain.
We believe taking such action would serve the long-term interest for the company,
including business risks associated with potential disruption of food supply chain
due to the loss of pollinators as well as competitive reputational risks. These and
other pollinators play a signiﬁcant role in global food systems and face well-
documented risks from pesticide usage.
Approximately 1 of every 3 bites we eat comes from plants pollinated by honeybees.
Further, Pepsi is a major purchaser of crops which are highly dependent on
pollinators. As a result, the sharp declines in the number of pollinators recorded in
the U.S. and Europe pose risks to Pepsi's supply chain. This is the third year a
proposal on this topic has been ﬁled. In that time, scientiﬁc and consumer concern
continues to grow and peer companies have responded. Unfortunately, Pepsi has
not. Its reporting on its pesticide use more broadly is out of step with the rising
concerns from consumers and health professionals regarding the use and exposure
to such chemicals.
According to a 2015 consumer report survey, 89% of people think it is critical to
protect the environment from chemicals and 86% think it is critical to reduce
pesticide exposure and support fair working conditions. And in July 2016, prominent
health providers and scientists released a scientiﬁc consensus statement calling for a
signiﬁcant reduction in exposures to harmful chemicals. The group cited linkage
between neurodevelopmental disorders in children and exposures to
organophosphate pesticides, in particular, used in food production. Several of
Pepsi's peers which are mentioned in the shareholder proposal are disclosing
strategies to improve programs and some have begun to describe plans to improve
pollinator health. As investors, we're concerned that Pepsi's inaction could pose
business and reputational risks. Pepsi's sustainable farming initiative has the
potential to provide a framework to address this issue but currently, it does not.
Unilever, in contrast, disclosed its results related to a sustainable agricultural code in
this way. Unilever expects growers to implement practices to reduce pesticide use. InFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 8 of 12Indra K. Nooyi2012, Unilever began collecting data from farmers, including pesticide use metrics.
And found that farms that implemented integrated pest management and other pest
-- integrated pest management programs reported using 1 kilogram less pesticide
per ton of crop than those that did not, with no loss in crop yields.
In closing, widespread public and scientiﬁc concern about environmental and public
health impacts from bee-harming pesticides and other pesticides pose risks to our
company's food supply chain. Company peers are providing much more disclosure
on strategies and actions. We would like Pepsi to do the same. Thank you for your
time and consideration.
{BIO 1404395 <GO>}
Thank you, Chris. Thank you for coming to our meeting. As we discussed last year,
we recognize that pesticides is an important issue within PepsiCo's supply chain, no
question about that. That's why as a company, we are focused on promoting
sustainable agriculture, including the responsible use of agrochemicals and
expanding our sustainable farming initiative. And through our policies and initiatives,
we aim to optimize the use of pesticides, nutrients and other agrochemicals and
support sustainable practices that substitute natural controls for some agrochemicals
and foster overall ecosystem balance.
In addition, pesticide use is regulated by agencies responsible for ensuring public
safety. And we require that all of our suppliers comply with all laws and regulations
applicable to their operations. And our sustainable agricultural policy sets standards
of performance and expectations for our growers across our diverse global supply
chain, including compliance with governmental laws, regulations and industry
standards. And this policy also includes a broad-based objective speciﬁcally
addressing agrochemical and nutrient management.
We've also developed sustainable farming initiatives to be a comprehensive
framework to gauge environmental, social and economic impacts associated with
our agricultural supply chain. And through this initiative, as a company, we're taking
a holistic approach that addresses a wide variety of interconnected issues, including
the one you raised today.
Agrochemicals are one of the 16 indicators in the SFI framework through which we
gather information on pesticide management and application, including measures
to enable safe, legal and responsible use while minimizing agriculture application.
I must say, we are proud of our consistent public disclosure on a wide range of
critical environmental, social and governance issues impacting our business. Our
sustainability disclosures are designed to be interconnected, something that we feel
is very important to ensure a holistic approach to sustainable agriculture and avoid
the unintended consequences of focusing on any one issue in isolation. And we
believe our resources will be better used in the continuation of our current policies
and practices regarding our supply chain impact. And we believe these policies andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-03

Page 9 of 12Robert Thomaspractices address the concerns that you raised in your proposal. For these reasons,
we recommend that shareholders do not support this proposal.
The second shareholder proposal on the ballot was submitted by Holy Land
Principles Inc. Would Robert Thomas, the representative of the proponent, please
introduce himself and the proposal?
{BIO 19619802 <GO>}
Good morning, Madam Chairman and everyone else here. I rise to move the
resolution on the Holy Land Principles. My name is Robert Thomas from
Fredericksburg, Virginia. The Holy Land Principles are pro-Jewish, pro-Palestinian and
pro-Pepsi. The Principles do not call for quotas, reverse discrimination, divestment,
disinvestment or boycotts. The Principles do not take any position on solutions to the
Israeli-Palestinian issue. The Principles do not try to tell the Palestinians or the Israelis
what to do. The Holy Land Principles only call for fair employment by American
companies in Palestine-Israel. Let me repeat that. The Holy Land Principles only call
for fair employment by Pepsi and the other 547 American companies doing business
in the Holy Land.
Irrespective of what Americans think about the Palestine-Israel issue, one thing is
certain. Americans expect American companies in the Holy Land to practice fair
employment. Yet, incredibly, before The Holy Land Principles were launched in 2012,
the issue had never been brought before Pepsi or any other of the 542 American
companies doing business in Israel-Palestine.
Our resolution calls on Pepsi for the second time to set the standard by signing and
implementing The Holy Land Principles which are based on the very eﬀective
MacBride Principles for Northern Ireland.
Initially, American companies resisted the MacBride Principles in Northern Ireland.
But now, 116 companies have signed on to these principles. So why would Pepsi or
any American company refuse to sign The Holy Land Principles?
In 2015, GE, Corning and Intel tried to get the SEC to exclude The Holy Land
Principles resolution from their 2015 proxy materials. However, the SEC ruled in favor
of The Holy Land Principles. Therefore, you may know The Holy Land Principles are
intrinsically valid, inherently fair and reasonable and in the best American tradition.
Furthermore, The Holy Land Principles are fully consistent with ESG issues and are a
practical and particularized application of the Ruggie principles.
Fair employment by the company is not only morally right but makes good
economic sense, good for the company, enhancing its reputation and making it
more proﬁtable for its investors. Signing The Holy Land Principles will send out the
very strong message that Pepsi is, in principle and in practice, committed to
American fairness in its operations in the Holy Land. Who could be opposed to that?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-03

{BIO 1404395 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr. Thomas. And thank you for coming to our shareholder meeting. As
we discussed last year, PepsiCo already has robust and comprehensive policies and
procedures that promote equal and fair employment practices, diversity and
inclusion and respect in the workplace. Our global antiharassment,
antidiscrimination policy sets forth a zero-tolerance policy towards any type of
harassment or discrimination. PepsiCo's values and global code of conduct reinforce
this policy. Our code prohibits discrimination or unfair treatment in matters that
involve any term or condition of employment and provides that employment
decisions must always be made based on merit, qualiﬁcations and job-related
performance. Our code also prohibits harassment or conduct of any kind that
creates an intimidating, oﬀensive or hostile work environment. Respecting human
rights is fundamental to PepsiCo's values, policies and business strategy. It's
fundamental to us. As a signatory to the UN Global Compact, our policies,
operations and strategies support universally accepted principles, including those
for human rights and labor standards.
Our new Performance with Purpose 2025 goals include advancing respect for
human rights. We believe PepsiCo's global policies and practices in the areas of
equal opportunity, human rights and diversity already address the goals of this
proposal and that our policies work best when they're applied in a consistent
manner across each of the markets in which PepsiCo operates. Therefore, the board
recommends that shareholders do not support this proposal.
Are there any questions about any of the agenda items we just reviewed?
We will open the ﬂoor to general questions on other topics at the end of the
meeting. As a reminder, in order to accommodate all of you who wish to pose a
question, each shareholder will be limited to 3 minutes for questions or comments.
And after 3 minutes, you will hear the chime indicating that your time is up.
Has everyone who wishes to vote done so? Are there any outstanding ballots at this
time? Please raise your hand and we'll collect them. And I'll remind you to vote again
on every item.
We're okay? Okay. We now seem to have all the ballots. And since all those desiring
to vote have done so, I will ask our inspector of elections to close the polls. Ms.
Vanderbeck and Mr. Stapleton?
I now declare the polls closed.

With respect to the nominees for Director, I'd like to report that all Director nominees

Ballot item #2, the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public
accounting ﬁrm for 2017, that has been ratiﬁed by the aﬃrmative vote of
approximately 98% of the votes cast.
Ballot item #3, the advisory vote on executive compensation, that has been
approved on an advisory basis by the aﬃrmative vote of approximately 94% of the
votes cast.
Ballot item #4, regarding the advisory vote on the frequency of future shareholder
advisory approval of executive compensation, the frequency option of every one
year received the most votes, representing approximately 90% of the votes cast.
Ballot item #5, a shareholder proposal regarding pesticide pollution, that has
received the support of approximately 9% of the votes cast and thus, did not receive
enough votes to pass.
Ballot item #6, a shareholder proposal regarding the implementation of the Holy
Land Principles, that has received the support of approximately 3% of the votes cast.
And thus, did not receive enough votes to pass.
Again, I remind you that these are preliminary voting results. And ﬁnal results will be
available after the votes have been certiﬁed by our inspectors of election. The ﬁnal
results will be disclosed on a Form 8-K that will be ﬁled with the U.S. Securities and
