{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us on
today's call on short notice.
With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Executive
Oﬃcer. And David Shannon, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative
Oﬃcer.
We'll begin with a summary of our ﬁling with the International Trade Commission
and US District Court of Delaware. And discuss our decision to take legal action to
protect our intellectual property. We will discuss the possible next steps in this
process.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-04

today's actions. We ask that you limit the questions to the matters of today's ﬁlings.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on
NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. And is also being recorded. The replay of the
webcast will be available until September 18th, 2014.
The content of today's conference call is NVIDIA's property and cannot be
reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.
During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on
current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of
signiﬁcant risks and uncertainties. And our actual results may diﬀer materially.
For a discussion of factors that could aﬀect our current ﬁnancial results and business,
please refer to the disclosure in our 10-Q for the quarterly period ended July 27th,
2014. And the reports we may ﬁle from time to time on Form 8-K with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
All of our statements are made of today, September 4, 2014, based on information
available to us today. And except as required by law we assume no obligation to
update any such statements.
Today we ﬁled complaints against Samsung and Qualcomm in the International
Trade Commission and US District Court in Delaware for using our GPU patents
without a license in Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets. This is the ﬁrst time in
NVIDIA's history we have initiated patent infringement claims against another
company.
NVIDIA is the world's leader in visual computing. And has invented the GPU and
technologies that are vital to mobile computing. We have the richest portfolio of
computer graphics IP in the world, with 7,000 patents granted and pending, created
by the world's best graphic engineers. And backed by more than $9 billion in R&D.
Our strategy is to continue to lead in visual computing technologies. And to seek
return on our investments, by serving markets where inventions make a contribution.
Our business model is selling processors to OEMs and licensing our GPU cores and
patents.
This powerful and rich graphic experience mobile users demand is enabled by
NVIDIA's patented inventions. Our patented inventions are used in billions of mobile
devices each year, including the millions of smart devices sold with our Tegra
processor incorporated.
Our Tegra processor sales are accelerating, with four consecutive quarters of
revenue growth. Our newest processor, the Tegra K-1, features the Xiaomi Mi Pad, theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-04

A - Jen-Hsun Huangrecently announced Acer Chromebook 13. And our new SHIELD tablet. Samsung and
Qualcomm have also relied on our powerful inventions for their mobile success.
There are hundreds of millions of mobile processors, phones. And tablets
manufactured by Samsung and Qualcomm with rich graphics powered by our
patented GPU technologies. These patents include programmable shading, uniﬁed
shaders. And multi-threaded parallel processing.
In terms of next steps, a decision will be issued by the ITC with 30 calendar days as
to whether to open an investigation. If this proceeds, a relatively quick discovery
process begins, leading a trial that would likely occur around mid-2015, with an initial
decision a few months thereafter.
In regards to the complaint with the District Court of Delaware, a scheduling
conference would likely occur within the next 60 to 90 days to set up trial dates.
We'd expect a trial to be scheduled two or three years from now.
Our IP provides signiﬁcant value to mobile devices. Licensing our GPU core and
patents is an important element of our strategy. We are asking the courts to
determine infringement of NVIDIA's patents by all graphic architectures used by
Samsung's mobile products. And to establish the value of our GPU patents.
Operator, we will now open it up for questions.
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions) And our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with
Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my question. Colette, I'm curious of the decision to sue speciﬁc
Samsung products, because I assume that many other handset makers probably use
that same Qualcomm Snapdragon chip. And probably many others use a similar
ARM or Imagination GPU IP. So why single out speciﬁc Samsung products, or is the
goal eventually to go and negotiate with other handset customers, also?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yes, Vivek. First of all, thanks for the question. I'll take it for you. First of all, well,
Samsung is one of the largest mobile device makers in the world. And they ship
hundreds of millions of mobile devices every year. All of them, we believe, infringe
on the GPU patents that we've invented. And so, it stands to reason that they'd be
the ﬁrst company we would engage in discussions with. And we've been in
discussions with them for a couple of years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-04
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 15Q - Vivek Arya
A - Jen-Hsun Huang
Q - Vivek Arya
A - Jen-Hsun HuangThere's another reason, which is that Samsung, because of their volumes. And
because of their breadth of product portfolio, includes all three GPU architectures
that are available to mobile devices, outside of ourselves. Qualcomm, of course, is
one of the major ones. But they're not the only one. They also use ARM and
Imagination Technologies.
And so, those are the reasons why we decided to engage discussions with Samsung
ﬁrst.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
So is the goal, Jen-Hsun, then -- then why are you going after Samsung? That's what
I'm curious about. So I understand they are large. But the -- this allegation of
infringement is really on the GPU side. So it's more with ARM and Imagination, rather
than with Samsung. Or is it Samsung, just because they are the ones who are
deploying that technology?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Well Samsung, because they're including the technology in their products. And
they're the ones that choose what architecture they ultimately use. We also named
Qualcomm in the suit because the GPU is included in Qualcomm's chips.
In the case of ARM and Imagination, they design cores. Now, neither of their GPU
architectures are licensed to our patents. However, their cores are included in
Samsung chips. And so, again, the two companies that are involved in this suit,
therefore, is Samsung and Qualcomm.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Just a last question. Apple also uses Imagination's GPU IP. And they're also a large
customer. So can they also be the subject of this kind of litigation in the future?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Well today we're focused on Samsung and Qualcomm. And we continue to have
productive conversations with a lot of other companies out there. But I think you
highlight a very important point, which is NVIDIA has been very inventive in this
space. We are the world leader in visual computing. We've invested a great deal
over the years in this one specialty and one speciﬁc ﬁeld.
We've been very inventive in it. We invented the GPU. We have the world's largest
portfolio of graphics patents. And now, with billions of mobile devices being
shipped each year and tens of billions being expected to ship in the coming years, it
stands to reason that this is an important area for us.
I've also told you, quite several times now, over the last several years, that IP
licensing and core is an important part of our overall strategy. And so, today's action
is really just a conﬁrmation of that strategy.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-04

Okay. And lastly, any litigation expenses we should be aware of? Thank you. That was
the last.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
We're not talking about expenses today. We'll report on that at our next earnings
call. But the important thing to really focus on is that we have such a large portfolio
of rich graphics patents and that the mobile market is going to have billions and
billions of devices. And they incorporate our technology in them today.
So this is an important part of our strategy. And it's a very serious part of our strategy,
as I've said before. We're very serious about our IP, our IP licensing strategy. And so, I
think the size of the opportunity for us is quite important for us to go after it.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Thank you.
And our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity.
Please go ahead.
{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two.
I guess, Jen-Hsun, just to sort of build on the last question, I mean, there's an OEM
here in the suit. And also a chipset provider in the suit. As devices are deployed in
the ﬁeld, are you guys making sort of any claims, or maybe you could give your
thoughts about where you think the real value extraction lies, with the chipset
provider that sells the deriving chipset revenue or with sort of the ecosystem that's
built on the device? And I think where do you think you'll be most successful in sort
of getting a royalty in the long term? Thanks.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Ultimately, we have to decide on a case-by-case basis. And in the case of Samsung
and Qualcomm, this is very clear, all right?. But we have to look at it on a case-by-
case basis.
All three architectures that we've mentioned, Qualcomm, ARM. And Imagination's
GPU architectures, we believe, infringe on some very important patents. And some
very important inventions that we've created over the years. And in each one of
those cases, the way they get to market is a little bit diﬀerent.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-04
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 15Q - Matt Ramsay
A - Jen-Hsun HuangThere are some OEMs that are vertically integrated and they design their own
phones or devices. And chips. There are some that buy chips from other people.
There are some that license this technology from other people. And so, there's a
whole lot of diﬀerent types of business models. And we'll deal with each one of
them on a one-on-one basis.
{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
All right. Thanks for that. And maybe just taking a little bit of a diﬀerent angle here,
because, obviously, there's a lot of questions that I think all of us could ask that you
guys probably wouldn't be able to answer today. But on more of a strategic angle,
Jen-Hsun, you've spoken a lot in the past about being pretty excited about Android
as a gaming platform, going forward. And I think it's interesting that, perhaps, the
largest shipper of GPUs into Android devices and also the largest OEM shipper of
Android devices are the two folks that you've named here in the suit.
Maybe you could talk about it from a strategic angle, broader than just extracting
royalties from handsets. But also from an overall strategic angle of how you guys
approach the market for Android GPUs in general. Thanks.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yes. Well you know we're a technology company. And we're a visual computing
technologies company. And visual computing is used in all kinds of markets.
Android is one of the most successful operating systems in the history of mankind. It
is synonymous with mobile cloud. And mobile cloud is going to be the computing
model of almost every computing device in the world, some day. It doesn't matter
whether it's initially started with phones and tablets. But it'll be in computers. And it'll
be in cars. And it'll be in TVs. And game consoles. And all kinds.
The entire world of computing will be mobile cloud, some day. And our strategy is to
focus on the markets whereby we can add the most value with products. Gaming is
one of them. Design is another, as you've heard me talk about, in the area of
enterprise. High-performance computing is an important market for us. Automotive
is an important market for us. Mobile is also an important market for us.
And in each one of these markets, we may choose to design an entire system. We
could sell a chip, which is essentially a one-time license use for an OEM, or we could
license GPU cores, if they would like to build their own vertically integrated or
proprietary solutions, or we could license patents for them to use in any designs or
products that they would like to create.
And so, we're a visual computing technology company at the core. And we have a
business model that starts from creating technology, inventing technology. And we
oﬀer it to the customers and oﬀer it to the marketplace in a whole lot of diﬀerent
form factors that suits their needs. And so, I think that this strategy allows us to stay
very, very focused on being the world's leading in visual computing. And yet beingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-04

speciﬁc to our core, whether it's gaming or automotive or design or otherwise.
{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
All right. Thank you.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Thanks a lot.
And our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman, with RBC Capital
Markets. Please go ahead.
{BIO 6507613 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys.
Jen-Hsun, if you could, should we -- if we were to look at your existing royalty stream,
especially the deal that you've cut with Intel, that is, I believe, a broad cross-license
that gives them complete access. Should we look at that as setting some precedent
to the value of the IP portfolio that you are trying to license, or is there, in this case,
limited in some way? Can you sort of, maybe, compare and contrast for us. So we
maybe we can get an idea of sort of the value potential here?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Well ultimately, we're asking the courts to help us establish the value of our patents.
But I think there's a lot of diﬀerent ways to think about the size of the market for us
with respect to IP licensing. With every major revolution of computing whether it was
client server, mainframe before it, the PC after client server. And now mobile
computing, the size of the marketplace has become larger and larger. And the
reason for that, of course, is because the nature of the technology can reach more
people. And become valuable to more people.
And in every one of those cases, every one of the succeeding generations, the
computer graphics part of it has been important. And in the last 21 years, we've
generated and contributed more to modern computer graphics than just about any
single company.
And so mobile computing is an important opportunity. And a good-sized market for
us -- and maybe put your phone on mute -- and then. And then those -- in this new
market of mobile computing, it goes into a lot of diﬀerent verticals. In some of the
verticals we may choose to design chips. In some of the verticals, we may choose to
license our patents. In some of the verticals we may decide to choose our cores. And
every combination.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-04

billions of devices that will be shipped in the future, GPU is such a vital part of its
experience. And our invention is so important to it, that this is -- should be an
important part of our strategy.
{BIO 6507613 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks a lot, Doug.
And our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna, with JMP Securities.
Please go ahead.
{BIO 3038925 <GO>}
Jen-Hsun, if I heard you correctly, you said you had been in talks with Samsung for a
number of years. I'm wondering, did something change recently, or why now in
terms of bringing the lawsuit?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Well we just made no progress. And they've not put a real oﬀer on the table. We've
spent quite a bit of time working with them. We've shared a lot of our claims. And
claim charts. And we've made every eﬀort to have a negotiated outcome. But
sometimes when you've been using technology for free for a long time, I guess it's
hard to sign up for a large and signiﬁcant license agreement.
But the fact of the matter is, they're using our technology for free in their devices
today. And they're shipping an enormous number of devices. And so, this is
something that's really important to us. And we need to resolve it. And that's -- after
working at it for a couple of years, we came to the conclusion that we just weren't
going to make any more progress. And so we decided to ask the courts for their
help.
{BIO 3038925 <GO>}
Okay. Then to follow up on Doug's question, I'm wondering, the dispute you had
with Intel, I'm assuming, that resulted in a cross-license, I'm assuming it's more in the
PC realm. Is there a diﬀerence in terms of the way the IP is deployed in a mobile
sense, or because it's being used with Android, or would you say that the position
that led you to such a favorable outcome with Intel is similar with what's going on
with Samsung and Qualcomm? Thank you.

Q - Hans Mosesmann
A - Jen-Hsun HuangWell I -- Intel ships about 300 million PC chips a year. And the mobile industry is
quite a bit larger than that. And visual computing is, arguably, even more important
in mobile computing than it is in computing and PCs before it. And so, I believe that
mobile devices, which really brings joy to people, when they're beautiful and
interactive. And can serve up all kinds of rich content for consumers, largely, it
beneﬁts greatly from the GPU that's inside it. And so, I think there's one part of it,
which is the size of the use of our technology is much, much larger in mobile market.
In terms of the actual agreements, it could be a license of IP. It could be a license of
our core. It could be a cross-license. It can come in a whole lot of diﬀerent ways.
And so this is a strategy, this is an important strategy of our Company. And -- but
each one of the customers will have their own speciﬁc needs. And we'll sit down and
talk to them.
{BIO 3038925 <GO>}
All right. Thank you.
And our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond
James. Please go ahead.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Thanks, Jen-Hsun, just to follow up on the series of questions, I think Colette
mentioned up front that Samsung, or maybe in the PR, that Samsung had indicated
that it wasn't their issue, it was their vendors' or suppliers' issue. By saying that, is
Samsung saying that there is validity to your patents. But it's not their problem? Is
that how they're positioning this?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Well I'd really like not to -- not to repeat conversations today. And, surely, they'll have
an opportunity to address some of these questions themselves.
But Samsung chooses what technology they incorporate in their phone, in their
smartphones. And tablets. And other devices. So ultimately, Samsung is culpable for
infringing our patents.
However, Qualcomm also infringes on our patents, because they incorporate our
GPUs inside their chips, our GPU patented technologies inside their chip. And their
chips are used by Samsung. And so, we decided to name both of them today. And
by doing so, we are focusing on two very large companies that have a large business
incorporating our GPUs and using them for free. And also, it allows us to engage all
three architectures in the marketplace at one time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-04

Securities. Please go ahead.
{BIO 6078412 <GO>}
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions.
Jen-Hsun, with over 7,000 patents, you chose just seven. And I was wondering if you
guys could give us a little more details behind why those seven patents were chosen,
given all the patents that you guys hold?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Well there's a -- it's a balance of making sure that we choose patents that we have
very high conﬁdence reads on their products. We've spent a lot of time analyzing
their products. And you're right, we have 7,000 issued and pending patents in this
one ﬁeld, in this very important ﬁeld. However, we have to ﬁnd a balance between
very high conﬁdence patents that reads on their products, as well as eﬃciency for
the courts.
Ultimately, it's -- we want to ﬁnd the balance of high-conﬁdence of winning. And the
most eﬃcient way of getting through the courts.
{BIO 6078412 <GO>}
Fair enough. Then, I know you didn't want to talk about expenses. But we're -- I
guess we can assume that the expenses, the litigation expenses, at least in the near
term, have already been factored in to the guidance that you guys have provided us.
And there isn't anything in addition that we should expect. And then you'll address
future OpEx litigation issues as we move forward. Is that a fair way to look at things?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Well we'll have an opportunity for Colette and I to talk about OpEx at the next
earnings call. But I think at the highest level, Betsy, I think that the important thing to
realize is IP licensing, IP is a very important part of our strategy. We are the world
leader in visual computing. We invented the GPU. We've contributed more to
modern visual computing than just about any company in the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-04

Page 11 of 15Q - Betsy Van Hees
A - Jen-Hsun HuangWe're singularly focused in this one important ﬁeld. We're incredibly inventive, over
the years. And we're still very, very inventive. And this technology is vital to the
growth and to the vibrancy of large markets, including the mobile computing
market, smartphones and devices.
So this is an important part of our overall company strategy. IP license -- creating --
inventing technology, IP licensing. And licensing, then, to OEMs and other
companies that are using it or would beneﬁt from it. And in this case, these two
companies are using our technology freely, without a license. And we would like the
courts to help us establish the validity of our patents, the infringement. And also the
value of the patents we should derive.
{BIO 6078412 <GO>}
Helpful.
You've been talking about this for a couple of years now. And you had that
presentation that you put together last summer, when you discussed in terms of the
monetization of your IP, that you guys would be working very judiciously in making
sure that that happened. And so, it appears as if you guys reached an impasse with
both Samsung and Qualcomm, which led you to take this action to protect your IP.
So -- and you said you were in discussions with other people. So we can, I guess,
look at this as -- for those other individuals that you guys are currently in negotiations
with and talking to, it's a pretty big shot over the bow, warning signal over the bow,
that you're not afraid to step into -- I mean, because you've taken on some pretty big
boys here, some pretty big players.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Well the courts don't really care how big or small a company is. All they care about is
whether a patent has been infringed.
And so, the courts will have to evaluate and assess this particular case on the merits
of this case. And we believe that -- and we're all experts in this ﬁeld. And we have a
lot of competitors. But we really have no peers. This is something that we deeply
care about. And technology is core to this Company. It's at the foundation of this
Company.
We've said. And I've said, that we are serious about IP licensing. And today's action
makes it very clear, indeed, that I am very serious about IP licensing. And so, it is a --
we've invested a great deal in getting here. We've invested $9 billion in a singular
ﬁeld of computing.
We have the richest portfolio of computing patents, graphics computing patents, in
the world. And so, it's -- we have to make sure that we're compensated fairly for the
use of our patents.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-04

Just, if you could describe the remedies that you're seeking from the court in these

Please go ahead.
{BIO 6967467 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks. Hi. Jen-Hsun, I was wondering if you could, perhaps, give us a sense of if
there's anything diﬀerent about your IP position now versus, say, ﬁve years ago. Is
there something new that's in your IP that makes it very clear that these other uses
are infringing? Is it something that clearly deﬁnes use of NVIDIA's new technology
versus, say, AMD's contribution to those areas of shaded technology, et cetera?
Anything that would limit the litigation to those relatively current generation of
products versus having it be applicable to older generations?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yes, I would say three things.
One, AMD should decide on the merits and the value of their patents.
Two, the last ﬁve years have been a quite important ﬁve years. And the reason for
that is mobile computing has exploded. The mobile computing world today, versus
ﬁve years ago, is utterly diﬀerent. And today, the rich displays and the importance of
rich graphics applications all over the web is more important than ever. And
obviously, it is also larger than ever.
We've also invested, in the last ﬁve years, in adapting our cores so that they're
mobile friendly. Because of the eﬀorts of Tegra, all of our GPUs today are mobile-
ready. The energy eﬃciency is fantastic, like the TK-1, Tegra K-1. And, yet, the
architecture is identical to the architecture that we use in high-performance PCs and
work stations.
And so, we have more ability to license our GPU cores to OEMs and technology
companies than ever before. And it wouldn't have been possible, if not for our focus
in the mobile market.
Then, lastly, I guess I would just add and reiterate that it does take some time in
engaging discussions with these companies on something this signiﬁcant. We're
talking about a very large number of devices. We are talking about technology that
we have invented. And so, the impact to them is, of course, not insigniﬁcant. And so,
these conversations do take time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-04

OperatorBut these factors all played into it. Okay?
{BIO 6967467 <GO>}
Yes. That's very helpful.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
All right. So --
{BIO 6967467 <GO>}
Thanks, Jen-Hsun. Can I get a follow-up in there, just brieﬂy?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Sure. Sure.
{BIO 6967467 <GO>}
I'm just wondering -- you don't want to talk about OpEx. That's understandable. I'm
just wondering, though, to prepare these two ﬁlings, did you need to go to outside
counsel to do that, or are you doing that entirely internally?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
We always have some outside counsel working with us, because our internal legal
department is not the size of all of the various legal work that we have to do. And we
have a lot of world experts that are working with us, from a lot of diﬀerent places.
So okay, thank you very much, JoAnne. I really appreciate it.
Hi. everybody, thank you for joining us today. Today's action was a very important
new chapter for our IP licensing strategy. We have the world's largest and the most --
the richest collection of graphics IP in the world. And IP licensing is a very important
part of our strategy. And I look forward to reporting on our progress as we go
forward.
Thank you very much for joining us.
Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. We thank
you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.
