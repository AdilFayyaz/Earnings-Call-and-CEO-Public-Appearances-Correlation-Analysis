{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Okay. Good morning, everyone. I am Mark Murphy, Software Analyst with J.P.
Morgan. And it is an absolute pleasure to be here this morning with Rajesh Jha, who
is EVP of Oﬃce Products Group with Microsoft. Rajesh, thank you so much for
making the trip and being here with us.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Well, thanks for having me.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So, perhaps we can start by trying to put Oﬃce in a high-level perspective. There
have been many junctures we've lived through in the last 10 to 20 years. People
would basically assume that Oﬃce was pretty penetrated, right, pretty saturated. We
look at it today, it's a $45 billion business. It's growing in the low-teens. If you think
about the perspective on that. It's larger than Oracle, it's larger than all of SAP, it's
growing faster. So what do you view as the key ingredients? Or what do you think as
the broader phenomena that are kind of driving this Oﬃce business to deliver such
durable growth?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
I mean, our technology has evolved, but more importantly, the scenarios that we
have focused on as we're working with our customers, taking a look at the trends,
that has evolved over the years as well. Ten years, 12 years ago, when we started
Oﬃce 365. Our vision was -- this way before the pandemic, our vision at that time
was to allow people to work from anywhere, any place, at any time. While delivering
productivity in communications and collaborations solutions, but at enterprise-grade
security and compliance.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

Page 2 of 13Mark MurphyAnd I think the thing that we got right early was really trying to work with our
customers and get them to make transition to the cloud on their terms. And some
choose to go all in into the cloud, a decade ago. For the others, it was more of a
hybrid set-up. Whether, it's some users moved to the cloud, some stayed on PRAM
or there was [ph] some workloads are moved to the cloud. And then about ﬁve years
ago, we really took a step back and we felt -- by the way, the one thing that the cloud
did was not just economies of scale, it was economies of skills.
Because as Microsoft, we took it upon ourselves to actually keep our customer
updated and integrated and that because we got all the customers in the same
version of all our products, it enabled a lot of new scenarios. And that is what
allowed us create something like Microsoft Teams. We would never have been able
to create something like Microsoft Teams in a classic on-premises world. But in a
cloud, all our customers were in the same base line of the diﬀerent infrastructure. So
with Teams, we took a step back and we said, it's not about the apps, it's not about
the devices, it's about people and groups and how do you bring sync and async
communication collab together.
And then security and compliance, we knew it was an area we needed to investment
in. And as systems of record, and systems for engagement started to come together,
we knew we had to invest in automation and so you have the power platform. So I
guess I would say, Mark, the thing was we taken -- we've stayed with the word
productivity, but we've taken a broader and broader perspective of that in Oﬃce.
It was initially were information workers and even in information workers, you go
back to Oﬃce way back when. And people thought we were saturated because
Oﬃce was all about creation. Word, Excel are [ph], but then it was about creation, it
about collaboration and communication and security and compliance and
automation. And then we didn't stop any information workers. 80% of the workers
on the planet are ﬁrst-line workers, are front-line workers. And as companies go
through digital transformation front-line workers are incredibly important for
productivity.
So we've gone from information workers, knowledge workers, the front-line workers,
small businesses, and then the TAMs. One of the things on productivity, I think is the
addressable market. We continue to grow the addressable market where creation
tools, the collaboration tools, the security, the compliance, and now we think about
employee experience and productivity, especially in our hybrid world, how to those
come together. So I'm incredibly excited to stay, you know on this journey to deﬁne
productivity at the individual level, at the team level, at the org level.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
It's an amazing vision. Rajesh, when we look back on the March quarter. In aggregate
for Microsoft, a very solid quarter. We came out of that, we raised our forecast for
Oﬃce. In contrast, there were many software companies who saw a slowdown. And
investors now are concerned that perhaps this whole demand environment was
moving forward during the pandemic. We get these questions, if reopening causedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 13Rajesh Jha
Mark MurphyZoom to slow down, right? Why didn't it cause Teams to slow down, for instance?
From your perspective, what impact did the pandemic and the lockdowns have and
as well as the pivot to remote work on this whole Oﬃce business?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah. In the pandemic, it deﬁnitely accelerated the move to the cloud for many of
our costumers. I mean, the growth that we saw in Oﬃce 365 and Microsoft Teams,
even small businesses, they had to really reinvent a new way of working. And so, we
brought forward a lot of people moving to the cloud that were perhaps on the
sidelines, and perhaps not fully using the cloud. And so, we created things like trials
to let them get onboard really quickly. We created speciﬁc small business oﬀerings
like Teams essentials, aﬀordable collaboration, meeting tools, but our usage has
never been higher.
Even coming out of the pandemic, it's never been higher. And so when people think,
why is that the case? Well, with Teams it's multimodal. Teams is not just meeting
solution. With Teams, what we said was, hey, how do a group of people collaborate?
Whether it'd be you know, a project team or in the board room, or a ﬁrst-line worker
working with their managers, how are they work? It's synchronous and
asynchronous, it's across diﬀerent times zones, at diﬀerent shifts. It's about people
being either face-to-face or being distributed. And so, even if the actual number of
minutes in meetings goes down, collaboration, especially when you're trying to go
through a digital transformation, you're digitizing business processes. The need for
collaboration has never been greater. And so, usage of Teams continues to grow, but
it's not just Teams and Oﬃce 365.
If I take a look at the usage today in Oﬃce 365, it's never been higher from other
modules. Our customer that would use four of modules, now maybe using six of our
modules. But it's not just the number of modules, the depth of usage of these
modules continues to grow. And so, if you wonder why, I do think in a hybrid world,
digital tools are -- is where work will have to get represented, work will have to get
done, that's how collaboration happens. That's how you work ﬂexibly across diﬀerent
time zones, and across base and time.
So you know, and I think now that we have a strong base line, and a growing base
line of the usage and consumption, we continue to grow our -- the scenarios that we
want to serve our customers with, whether it'd be the phone system in Teams,
whether it'd be house space for -- whether it'd be a focus room, or open
collaboration space, a conference room, small-medium-large at diﬀerent jobs, how
we should that involve with Teams. We thought about employee experience in Viva,
how you balance productivity, wellness, learning, knowledge. And then devices
become incredibly important, and we try to virtualize devices with Windows 365. So
the usage has never been higher, and I'm excited about how we can continue to
serve our customers in this hybrid world.

Page 4 of 13Rajesh Jha
Mark Murphy
Rajesh JhaSo, great to hear that usage has never been higher, and I want to come back and
touch on many of the products you just mentioned...
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Including Phone Teams and devices. Let's start with an assumption for a moment that
remote work and hybrid work are permanent societal shifts, and this is going to be
with us for a while. What are these types of diﬀerentiated experiences that you are
creating currently that, perhaps, maybe we're not even considering yet, right? As you
try to help workers connect and collaborate the world?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, a couple of things I would note. Just a couple of things I would note
here. First, I do think this hybrid work, where individuals one of the things that we
recently released was our latest work trend index. And so we interviewed 30,000
information workers and ﬁrst-line workers across 30 diﬀerent countries. And then the
other thing that we have with Microsoft 365 or Oﬃce 366 is massive amount of the
signal. So we can see a lot of the data and the usage patterns and the
communication patterns.
And so you would have heard us talk about this thing called a hybrid paradox, where
three-fourth of the employees, they want ﬂexibility in how they work. Whether they
work in their oﬃce space or they work elsewhere, but at the same time two-thirds of
these employees they also want more face-to-face time with their colleagues. So this
the paradox. Three-fourth, they want ﬂexibility. Two-third, the same two-third they say
hey I want to be face-to-face and build oﬀ the energy.
The other thing that I'll just say that was striking to me, even though intuitively [ph] as
I reﬂect on it, makes sense is; remote work, hybrid work tends to make strong ties
stronger, and weak ties weaker. And that is important, then why is that. So when you
are not -- and the serendipity, the water cooler, you're coming out of a conference
room, meeting talking to somebody who is not in your immediate work group, an
immediate work group being a strong tie. But no matter how an organization sets up
the org structure, what is not always done in a hierarchical manner, work has to
transcend these boundaries, that's all weak ties.
So what we are thinking about here is, let's just take Microsoft Viva, for example, it's
an application that's built on Microsoft Teams. Because Teams is about putting [ph]
groups at the center, people at the center, and bringing the right apps, the right
data, the right AI, the right automation to people. So the Viva, and hybrid work,
you've heard about the triple bump of the day where people took three peeks, one
before lunch, one after lunch and one in the evening before going to bed. It's like
productivity has to be balanced with their well-being.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

Rajesh JhaAt Microsoft alone, a third of our employees started during pandemic. How does in a
world where our costumers have higher attrition, new people joining, remote work;
how does the knowledge gets discovered? And how do you create knowledge?
How does that get discovered? How do you balance wellness eﬀectively? How does
learning take places in the ﬂow of work? How do diﬀerent teams align on their core
mission? And these that the things, how does a front-line worker connect to their
leadership?
So these of the things that we think broadly of employee experience for this world
where strong ties tend to get stronger, weak ties tend to get weaker. With these
things have to come into the ﬂow, so I would say Microsoft Teams and Viva, but there
are other things we are thinking about. Documents today a super monolithic. How
do you get the documents to be the ﬂow of communications, but also hand together
as a document with things like Microsoft Loop? So we got lots of things we gotten to
do and we are going to learn, and we're going to iterate [ph].
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
You mentioned Loop at the end, correct?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
I just want to make sure. It's okay. We'll come back to that as well.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah, okay.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So Oﬃce 365 Commercial is the bulk of the business. We recently ran a survey and it
was showing us that O365 is going to exceed 60% penetration of all corporate
employees, right, in the coming years, which is a very high number. You've had this
seat count growth running around 16% for that in recent quarters, and then you had
shared that this had hit 345 billion seats of Oﬃce 365, so let me begin with a very
simple question, how much runway do you see now for a seat growth?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, I just as [ph] growth, we think about it in three diﬀerent dimensions. So
we can think about it in three diﬀerent dimensions. The ﬁrst, let's talk about what you
said. Seat growth. The seat growth, there are a billion information workers, the
projections is about 2025 information and knowledge workers; there are a couple of
billion more ﬁrst-line workers that are on the front-lines of this transformation ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 13Mark Murphy
Rajesh Jha
Mark Murphybusiness processes. There are small businesses, there is industry-speciﬁc role
oﬀerings, there is education. So we think broadly that we have lots to room here to
grow the seats with Oﬃce 365.
Then the other dimension is the addressable market. So, with Oﬃce 365, it's not just
about creation tools, or collaboration tools, or communication tools. It's about
security and compliance, it's about employee experience, it's about learning, it's
about knowledge management, it's about content management, and you know it's
about how even industries like phone systems, how do they involve for the future,
how does space evolve to allow hybrid work.
So if we think of our addressable market it is pretty broad. I mean, that's a great thing
productivity. It is like it is what is the heart of the modern economy. And so, we
always start to take a step back and take an inclusively look at the productivity. But
that ﬁnal item I'd just say, I talked about usage and our usage has never been higher,
and the more usage there is, the more our customers, you see that they opted
renewals, lesser discounting, and then we have things like E5 it's the premier tier,
where we bring it all together for our customers and very early days of seeing that
play out for our installed base.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So your aperture is broader than a billion information workers, right? It goes well
beyond that. You just mentioned E5, and I wanted to just touch on that for a moment.
There is a sense of, there is so much value packed in to these SKUs E3, E5. There has
been speculation on E7 coming at some point, where do you think you are in the
process of packing in more value into the SKUs and monetizing it?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
I'd just say, you know last year, we said 8% of our installed base, our commercial
oﬃces were installed base had moved to E5, and are like, this is still early. And
remember, you know, this is, we are talking information workers. But we have, like I
said, we aim to go broader with SMB in ﬁrst-line worker, and industry-speciﬁc role
oﬀerings, and so the mix of how E5 plays out over time depends on the more FLWs
we have, they are probably not E5 users. Information workers quite, early still in the --
in that cycle.
The value, in terms of the value of E5, I agree with you. I mean there is a lot for our
customers there. Now our customers can choose to get not the bundle, they can
choose to get just the security oﬀering, or the compliance oﬀering, or the phone
system oﬀering, or the analytics oﬀering, they can choose to get out each of these
separately. But we think the value taken together for our customer with all of the E5
SKUs, and many of them actually want to get the entire suite, it's incredible value.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So Rajesh. Teams, is a part of that incredible value.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

Rajesh Jha{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
A couple of years ago, Satya described Teams, I believe he said it's the fastest
growing app I have seen. We step back, and we were thinking about that. It's a pretty
big statement, right, because Oﬃce grew quickly, Loop [ph] grew quickly, Exchange
grew quickly. Earlier this year, I believe you had said Teams had crossed 270 million
monthly actives, right. So it's not too far behind the Oﬃce 365 commercial seats.
How do you view the signiﬁcance of Teams? If we step back and say, put this us in a
historical context for us, and what is it about that, that Teams experience that you
would say is fundamentally diﬀerent than other competing products of the world.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
It's a great question, Mark. I mean, I've been in the Oﬃce in and around the Oﬃce
business a long time, and I would just say Teams is remarkable. But I do think the
fundamental -- even you said what makes it diﬀerent? What makes it diﬀerent is the
fact that it's multimodal. So it's not about one modality of a meeting, or one modality
of a chat, or one modality of creation. It's -- with Teams, we take a step back and we
said, whatif we didn't start with tool ﬁrst, what we started with people ﬁrst and
groups ﬁrst. And then when people congregate together, whether in a informal chat
or a formal group or a channel, how do we bring the right modalities of chat and
meetings and the phone system and documents and ﬁles and dashboards and
business automation, how do we bring all of that together.
So the tools ﬁnd you, you didn't go from tool-to-tool to your job, and if there is
group, a work group of 20 people and they are all independently seek diﬀerent
tools, that's not going to work. And so with Teams, what is remarkable is that we see
it as relevant in the board rooms, for a CEO and their leadership team taking a look
at business performance and have a shared context as it is on the shop ﬂoor, and we
are seeing success, a broad success. Recent CIO survey showed 50% of the CIOs are
standardizing on Microsoft Teams, and with three years that number was projected
to get to about two-thirds. But what is really remarkable with Teams is not the
multimodality application, the usage, is the fact that it's a platform. That it's a
platform in an ecosystem that transcends a given device. So if you are an ISV or even
Microsoft, like we're creating things like Microsoft Viva as applications and team.
If you write an application for Microsoft Teams, your application runs on the
Windows, on the Mac, on the web, on the mobile devices, iOS or Angular. And so we
have ServiceNow and Workday and Adobe and Monday.com and lots and lots of
other ISVs. In fact, if you take a look at the number of third-party and custom
applications that have been built on Microsoft Teams, two years ago to now, it has
grown 10x. And so, the ecosystem is the real diﬀerentiation with Teams. And an
ecosystem also plays out in the devices side. We have Poly, and Logitech, and Zebra,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 13Mark Murphy
Rajesh Jha
Mark Murphy
Rajesh Jhaand all these folks were building devices that are optimized for Microsoft Teams. We
have tel-co operators that are connecting their backplane into the Microsoft
backplane. So a customer that wants Microsoft Teams phone or collaboration or
conferencing has no conﬁguration to go to.
And then I feel this is just the base line, and then we have diﬀerentiated point of view
on how space, companies' space evolves with Team rooms, how their phone system
evolves, how employee experience evolves, and so yeah Teams is truly special.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So you said the tools ﬁnd you.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
And Teams Phone has been ﬁnding a lot of people. Can you help us understand the
strategy there? How far are your ambitions stretching out with Teams Phone and how
would you think about the scale of that speciﬁc opportunity?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah, you know, I mean, see it's a very interesting. It seems obvious now, but the
phone course makes no sense to be anchored to a desk anymore. Especially in a
hybrid work, the phones got to be around the individual, it's got to be around the
person, and not are on the desk. And so a lot of customers do want to get from their
legacy PBX systems to something that is much more person-centric setup for the
hydro world. The one thing about phone is, it's -- people don't -- when you work with
somebody, like three of are in a chat, you want to escalate that quickly to a phone
call. Quickly to a synchronous modality, and go back to the asynchronous modality.
And so, there has to be a continuum between the phone system and collaboration.
Even when you start with a phone call you want to bring a whiteboard in, you want to
be able to bring a shared -- screen sharing, so you can actually communicate quickly.
So we think there is a blending of a phone oﬀering that is person-centric and
whether it'd be VoIP-based or PSTN-based. Whether it'd be inside of an
organization, whether it'd be across organization. And so we see broad demand for
phones across diﬀerent industries of all shapes and sizes. And so, we have over 80
million people that use Teams phones in all of these diﬀerent ﬂavours. The thing that
is exciting to me is the time to value for customers.
Once they decide to get oﬀ their legacy PBXs on to the phone system, the time to
value is in weeks. In weeks they can get conﬁgured. Because again the backplane is
the same. Teams is multimodal, you're conﬁgured for Teams, you're conﬁgured in
your directory to add the phone is a question of weeks, it's not years in the making.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 13Mark Murphy
Rajesh JhaSo hugely cost eﬀective, ﬂexible, multimodal. And so I think we have a real
diﬀerentiated perspective regarding [ph] phones.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So when we look at how Oﬃce 365 is being purchased, 45% of that is purchase
through Microsoft 365. And I think most people in the audience would probably
think of Microsoft 365 as the set of very ﬁnished applications and services. But I have
heard you refer to this as a -- basically a rich developer platform. You've alluded to
some of that foundation underneath it, Microsoft Graph the ﬂuid framework. Is there
any way you can help make that tangible for this kind of non-technical audience, and
we try to explain some of the diﬀerentiation.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
I think this is a really important point, Mark. I mean, Microsoft 365 is a set of ﬁnished
services for sure. The time-to-value for customers, whether it being creativity or
solution or productivity or collab. We want to get the time-to-value to be really quick.
But ﬁrst and foremost, it's also a platform. Because Microsoft sounds on [ph] build
every single productivity application, and project management application.
So Teams is set up as a platform like I had earlier talked about. You'll ﬁnd Zoom in
the Teams store, you'll ﬁnd RingCentral in the Teams store. You are going to ﬁnd all
sorts of project management and whiteboard companies in the Teams store. So at
the UX layer alone the UI layer, we are a platform where people can plug-in. Because
this is really our customers' choice in the end of the day on how they plug-in. But
even below the UX layer Teams as a platform had the data layer, and we call the data
layer, the Microsoft Graph. And Satya once said this, and I think it's the right
characterization.
The Microsoft Graph is the most important database for any company. Because that
database has all the companies' employees who they work with, the meetings they
are in, the documents that are shared, the documents that are trending. You know
the projects and the deadlines of diﬀerent people. And this is the database on which
Microsoft can run a massive amount of AI to give you both insights, deep insights
and the right recommendation in the ﬂow of work. And then Microsoft Graph is an
extensible platform. So each one of Microsoft 365 applications writes to the graph,
gets some value from the graph, but we allow third parties to also write to the graph
and get value from the graph. The graph of course is owned by the customer, and
the right permissions have to exist, and the right IT controls exists.
The other part of Microsoft 365 that is a platform, is you know how the user
experience can be composable. And so, we've done that ourselves today with
Microsoft Loop, we talked about Microsoft Loop, I'm really excited Microsoft Loop,
but documents have tended to be somewhat monolithic and users go to documents,
of course with Teams you can hang all the documents around a group, but with
Microsoft Loop we allow documents to be decomposed. So for example, I've got a
project update and there is a table that a bunch of us need to update. Instead of
telling everybody, hey can you go update the table, I can take that table, that snippetFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 13Mark Murphy

Mark Murphyof the document from that in chat or email and send it out. And as people started to
ﬁll it, it's always live. And when I go back to the document, it shows the same state. If
I am in chat it shows the same state, in email it shows the same state.
If I were to take that component and put it in a word document, it is always live and
connected. Now this is extensible so third parties can participate in that too. So with
Microsoft 365, ﬁnished services, focus on time-to-value, but we want to make it
extensible and we have made it a platform both at the UX layer and the data layer.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So with this canvas in the surface area that you have, and you're describing to us the
Graph data, the AI, you seem to have an advertising opportunity and you had made
this comment in January. The advertising business is over 10 billion in trailing 12-
months revenue, that was an incredible stat. You're investing in this area, can you
share with us how you think about your strategy in advertising?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah. As you know, it's a large market and I think we are well positioned to play in
this market. So a couple of things. Let's start with LinkedIn. LinkedIn Marketing
Solutions. Now LinkedIn is like the highest trusted social network. And for customers,
for advertisers, B2B advertisers, it's -- they have a really large engaged audience.
Now let's take a look at Windows, 1.4 billion active devices. With Edge, we have
started to gain share and now we have more room there to grow.
And then with Microsoft Start, it's like this personalized feed that is used by about
half a billion people. And so, you have curated content and content consumption,
commerce, now we got this lively [ph] going. We are investing in scenarios. What do
people do in the PCs. The PCs have never been more relevant. People do shopping,
they do learning, they do gaming, they do browsing. So we are investing in those
scenarios, both in Windows and with Edge.
And then, as you know, we recently completed our acquisition of Xandr. And then
you take the deep audience intelligence that we have, and the Xandr data-driven
platforms we think we can accelerate this even more. So these are the main
mainstream things, but we are also exploring advertising in other surfaces like
outlook.com, our consumer mail oﬀering or gaming. Gaming is high engagement,
and we think it's really interesting to see their new business models possible with
gaming. So yeah, I think we are well positioned here.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So new business models. You had mentioned the theme of citizen developers using
Teams and power platform at one of the recent build conferences. Personally, I've
been a bit of a skeptic on this whole topic and citizen developers, I'd say for most of
my career, right, because we've we never saw convincing signs and traction from any
other software company.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 13Rajesh JhaAnd that is until now, right. So with the power platform that has been ranking
number two in our product momentum Microsoft partner survey work, right, that
we've been conducting. The signs are very clear, can you put that into context, why is
there so much momentum and do you think that you ﬁnally cracked the code on this
trend with the power platform?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah, you know, I mean yesterday it was Microsoft build, and some really exciting
announcements on our platform, on Azure, Data and AI infrastructure. But even on
Microsoft Teams, yesterday we announced multiplayer sharing. Today if somebody
shares an Excel ﬁle with you or a video with you, you're passively consuming it. Now
we've got true multiplayer gaming like sharing going on as core platform, and other
things in Microsoft Teams. If you are an ISV write an application for Teams, it also runs
in Outlook in Oﬃce.
New tooling, individual studio to create Teams apps. But let's talk about power
platform. Very exciting announcement yesterday where -- today power platform has
an ability to you can analyze with Power BI, so people can drive data-driven, you
connect to all the business data through connectors and drive insights with Power BI,
you can create new application, and act on it through power apps.
Yesterday, we announced that now it's even simpler to create a power app. You can
just point it to a image of how the app should look. And it will, the AI will do most of
the work of creating that for you, the application for you. We have automation, the
way to making business process automation. And then we announced a new
member yesterday called Power Pages, which is a business-centric data-driven way
to create a website. Now look, why is this resonating Mark you had said?
It's simply. No, I mean I saw some staggering statistics, which is there is an
expectation as customers go through digital transformation. That in the next ﬁve
years, 500 million new applications are going to get created. That's more than in the
last 40 years. So where are these developers are going to create this half a billion
applications. IDC says today, there is a shortage of four million developers. So the
idea behind a power platform is digital transformation is happening. These
applications have to be low code -- no code with power platform. We the build all
the connectors to all the systems of record databases.
So a business person, who is closest to the business process can create, draw
insights, create his applications, create this power pages, automate business
processes. I mean I'm very, very bullish about how Power Platform can help our
customers with the digital transformation. And understand that these power apps
again -- you know [ph] Teams is an extensible platform. You can write a business
process in Power Apps, and consume it right in the ﬂow.
There is an update on your business process, it's posted in the chat of inside the
Teams. You can consume that on your phone or on the desktop.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

So in the very ﬁnal moment here, maybe we can do a lightning round question. And I
wanted to touch on the topic of security...
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
...to make sure we kind of wove this in. It is itself interwoven up and down the whole
product stack. We see incredible momentum, security ranked number one in our
partner survey work. So it's actually above Azure, and it's above Teams which is
interesting. Can you explain to us what is diﬀerentiating this Microsoft security
solution versus the other products in the market.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah, I could go on, but you said lightning rounds. So with Microsoft, we are -- our
security cloud works on multiple clouds, not just in Azure but GCP and AWS. Our
defender product works not just on Windows, but on all mobile platforms, and all
other desktop platforms. So we are multi-cloud, multi-platform, multi device, but the
real diﬀerentiation is how end-to-end it is. It talks about -- our security cloud
addresses identity, compliance, privacy, security. And I would say if you double click
a level, what's the diﬀerentiation? The diﬀerentiation is scale. We have 24 trillion
signals every single day coming to our security cloud on which we can run AI and we
can help our customers with these threats. And the threats have never been more.
Today Microsoft tracks 40 plus state actors, 140 diﬀerent persistence threat actors.
And you know, just a couple of years ago, it was an handful. So the level of scale, the
level of insights, the trust that we have in the security cloud with over 785,000
customers betting on the Microsoft Security Cloud. So I would just say end-to-end
trust, insights, scale. And one last comment I'll make, people think end-to-end means
integration. And yes, but with our Microsoft Security Cloud, the individual
components are also best-of-breed. We work to be both best-of-breed, and best-of-
suite.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Rajesh, thank you so much for being here with us and sharing all these wonderful
insights, can't thank you enough for the time.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Well, thank you, Mark. It's great to be here. Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
