Welcome. Welcome to the Cybertruck Delivery Event. So I'm going to do it from the
back of the truck here.
So, once in a while, once in -- once in a long while, a product comes along that is
rare, that is once in -- once every ﬁve years to 10 years, something really special, a
really unusual product comes along. And we'll remember those special moments
when -- indeed. Special moments. So -- but these things are rare. It's very rare that a
product comes along that is seemingly impossible, that people said was impossible,
that experts said was impossible. And this is one of those times. We have a car here
that experts said was impossible, that experts said would never be made, that it
really is the most -- I think it's our best product. I think it's the most unique thing on
the road. And ﬁnally, the future will look like the future.
So -- so what we're aiming for here is something that has -- that's more truck than
truck.
(inaudible)
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks, bro. That's literally my brother there.
So -- and so, what we have here is something that is a better truck than a truck, while
also being a better sports car than a sports car in the same package.
So, ﬁrst of all, let's -- you know, let's talk about how, you know, trucks are tough.
That's one of the deﬁning characteristics of a truck. So, how tough is this truck? Let's
ﬁnd out. So we actually had to come up with a special, ultra strong, Tesla-designedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-30

Elon Musksteel alloy. So this alloy -- this metal did not exist before. We needed something that
you could actually manufacture, but that would be -- have basically no corrosion, that
didn't need paint, but you can still make it in volume. And part of the reason that it
has this angular shape is you can't actually stamp these body panels. The body
panels would break the stamping machine.
So -- oh, and I should say also the -- because of the steel exoskeleton, it actually has
more torsional rigidity than a sports car. It has more torsional stiﬀness than a
McLaren P1. So it's -- that's very -- is a big deal.
Now, you may remember an incident four years ago. Didn't quite go as planned.
And Franz, maybe we should try it again.
Harder.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. Yeah. Great. I mean, I think you could -- we could probably have a pro pitcher
(inaudible). It could [ph] still work. So anyway, it's -- the glass is tough, basically.
That's what we're saying. So you don't have to worry about, like, rocks hitting the
glass and cracking the glass. This glass is basically rock proof. It's also makes the car
very quiet. So it's -- the thing that you'll appreciate when you drive the car is that is
how smooth and quiet it is. It doesn't -- it feels -- it doesn't feel like a normal truck.
It's smooth as silk and silent when you drive it. And yeah -- so, tough -- in terms of
toughness.
And then things like roll over. Because the center of gravity is so low, it doesn't roll
over. And if you're ever in an argument with another car, you will win.
Yeah. So -- in movies, you sometimes see the hero or heroine hiding behind the car
door while being shot with bullets. That doesn't actually work unless you're driving a
Cybertruck. So if Al Capone showed up with a Tommy gun and emptied the entire
magazine into the car door, you would still be alive.
So, you know, people say like, well, you know, why'd you make it bulletproof? I'm
like, why not? Do you want to -- how tough is your truck? Because the other trucks,
the bullets go through both sides. So, you shoot a bullet, it goes through both sides
of the car. And you just never know. I mean, sometimes you get these like, late
civilization vibes. Yeah, you never know when the -- the apocalypse could come
along at any moment. And at -- here at Tesla, we have the ﬁnest in apocalypse
technology.
I was on the Joe Rogan show, and Joe bet me a dollar that his armor-piercing
steelhead arrow would go through the car. It -- he -- now he owes me a dollar.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-30

Page 3 of 4Now, what about utility? So, strength is great, but is this a -- you know, perhaps just a
show truck, just a showpiece, or that can't do actual work? How does it work as a real
everyday truck? Well, here we have the future towing the future. So, basically, if you
can ﬁt any cargo in the trunk or in the bed, you can basically move it around. So it's
got over a ton of payload capability, but you could really put more than that in it. You
can tow over 11,000 pounds, and it's got a super tough composite bed, no liner
needed. The bed is six-foot long, four-foot wide, and you can ﬁt four-by-eight pieces
of plywood in with the back down.
So for those who are really into the truck world, there's something in the truck world
called a truck pull. This is really the key test of how much power does your truck
actually have. So you have to pull this 40,000 pound sled. And when we went to the
track, we said, well, what's the best that you've seen? They said, well, it's -- it'd be the
Ford F-350 diesel. It was like, well, let's put our truck up against that. The guy who
runs the truck pull said that there's no way. There's no way. I said, well, let's try it.
Let's see what happens.
We actually had to slightly turn the car at the end so it didn't hit the wall. So this, you
have here a car that is, you know, bullet tough. You know, like that phrase TM [ph],
and can out-pull an F-350 diesel, has a massive towing capacity, massive bed. It's
basically an incredibly useful truck. It's not just some grandstanding showpiece like
me. It's actually very useful.
Now, what about performance? So this -- I should say, it has an adaptive air
suspension. So, no matter what the load is, you -- it will -- you can always have the -- it
can set the right height at any -- at low, high, anything. It'll automatically adjust the
damping according to how much load it's carrying and the road conditions. Has a 17-
inch ground clearance. That's a true 17 inches. The -- with a -- typically, with a truck,
you'll get the diﬀerential hanging down low, the rear diﬀerential, and that's what
you'll high-side on a rock. But this is -- this has a completely ﬂat bed. So, you could
drive over basically anything. We actually took the cybertruck on a Baja rally drive.
So this is insane oﬀ-road capability. It has locking diﬀerentials, rear torque vectoring.
And the crazy thing is, it'll do this all in comfort. It has steer-by-wire, which is -- it's
one of the things where -- most people don't know what that means, but it's what --
it's how modern jets are designed, the steer-by-wire, which gives you variable gain.
So if you turn the wheel, a small -- the steering yoke a small amount in the parking
lot, it will turn the wheels a lot. But if you turn it on a highway, it turns the wheels a
small amount. So it dynamically adjusts how much the wheels turn according to what
your speed is. And this actually makes it very easy to drive. It actually -- and it has a
turning circle less than a Model S. So this thing can practically turn it -- you know,
rotate on a, you know, dime, basically. It has incredible low speed maneuverability.
And then there's a lot of advanced details under the skin. It's the ﬁrst time that a car
is moving to a 48-volt low voltage architecture from 12 volts, which has been around
for 100 years. We have Ethernet comms, distributed controllers, allows for 70% less
wire in the car. And it's really -- the internals are as advanced as the externals. It's a
whole new step change in the technology.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-30

Page 4 of 4So let's take it to the racetrack and see how does the Cybertruck perform against a
Porsche 911. And I should say, this is an actual Porsche. It's -- we literally just got it
from the dealer, 2023 Porsche 911. But wait, there's more. So the -- it can tow a
Porsche 911 across a quarter mile faster than the Porsche 911 can go by itself. I should
say tougher than bullets, tow pretty much anything, faster than a 911 while towing a
911.
So -- and deliveries begin now. Thank you.
So -- just, these are the actual owners. We're handing over production Cybertrucks to
their actual owners. Thank you for buying Cybertruck.
All right. Thank you, everyone. Thanks for coming to this Cybertruck delivery event
and your witness to -- what? Oh, one more? Okay. Sorry.
All right. Thanks, everyone, for coming to this delivery event and appreciate your
support. And this is really going to, like, change the look of the roads, and ﬁnally, the
future will look like the future, and it's really going to be something special. Thank
you.
