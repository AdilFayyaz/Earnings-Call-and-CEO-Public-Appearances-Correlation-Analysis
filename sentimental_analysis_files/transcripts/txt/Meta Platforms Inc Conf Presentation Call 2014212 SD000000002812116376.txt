Okay, I think we are ready to get started. We are cognizant that we are your last
presentation before dinners or cocktails. So we will try and make this as good as
possible and as informative as possible. But we couldn't be happier to introduce for
the last session of the day the dynamic duo of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg, David
Ebersman. Thank you. So much for agreeing to be with us this afternoon. We really
appreciate your time.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
Happy to be here.
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you for having us.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
David, you guys just ﬁnished a remarkable year, 10-year anniversary. If you look out
over the next 10 years, what's in store for us as users of Facebook and investors in
Facebook?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
Yes. As you mentioned, earlier this month we had the 10th anniversary of the
founding of the Company. So that was an exciting milestone for us. And looking
back over our ﬁrst 10 years, clearly the most important thing that we accomplished
was connecting and building this network of over 1 billion people who use FacebookFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-12

Page 2 of 20Heather Bellinito share and interact with one another. And the way we think about it, this is just the
beginning. This is the foundation for us to build on looking forward.
You asked about the next 10 years. And let me sort of work my way out there starting
with a slightly shorter-term timeframe and working out to ten.
Over the next few years, probably the most important thing we need to deliver is to
build tools to help you to share all kinds of diﬀerent content with the audience that
you're interested in sharing it with. So if you think about the types of content that you
might want to share, it can range from a short message to a song to a video or a
photo or a link to an interesting news story. And if you think about the audience you
might want to share with, it can range from a private conversation with 1 person to a
small group of friends to a larger community of people, or to the general public at
large.
And what we want to do is build products and improve the existing products that we
have that make it really easy and rewarding for you to share any kind of content with
whatever audience you're interested in sharing with. And you should see us really
focusing on that and trying to make progress in that regard over the next few years.
If you look out a little further, say a 5-year time horizon, one of the most important
things we want to deliver is to improve and increase the usefulness, the value that
you get from the time that you spend with Facebook. And an example of what we're
trying to do here is graph search, which is a product that enables you to tap into the
social graph and all the information that's residence there to discover and learn
more about people and places and products that you might be interested in through
the eyes of people you're connected with on Facebook.
And this use case is already happening on Facebook today. People are going in and
making posts to ask about what the best local restaurant is or where to go on
vacation. But we think we can make it much better and easier for you to ﬁnd that
kind of information. And this is a really big technical challenge because of the
amount of data we have available and it's going to take time for us to do. But it's a
very important eﬀort for us.
If you look all the way out over the 10-year period you asked about, probably the
most important thing we can do is to contribute to wiring up the 3 billion to 4 billion
people in the world who aren't connected to the internet today. So we're working on
initiatives like internet.org and partnerships with other company to try and make the
technology and the data available and aﬀordable to people around the world. This is
a big challenge and it's also a huge opportunity for us and a really important priority.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
All right. And I would be remiss -- I was so excited to introduce them that I did not
read the safe harbor. So Deborah Crawford, I do not want to have her upset with me.
So I will just very brieﬂy say that Sheryl and David may make forward-looking
statements on future events.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-12

I may already have.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
He may have already.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
It's a retroactive statement.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
But this is retroactive, as well as the business strategy or prospects of Facebook.
Facebook cautions you to consider the important risk factors that can cause results
to diﬀer materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These risk factors
are described under the caption Risk Factors on Facebook's annual report on Form
10-K ﬁled on January 31 of this year.
And in addition please note that any forward-looking statements that Sheryl or David
makes are based on assumptions as of today. And they undertaken no obligation to
update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
So I apologize. My excitement got the best of me.
So Sheryl, switching to you, the Company has pivoted to mobile I think faster than
anyone would have thought, except maybe you guys. Can you talk about how you
see the opportunity unfolding over the next few years?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
Mobile is and has been a great opportunity for us. And I think when you think about
it, every person in this room, each of us has a phone that has the computing power
probably 100 times the computer that sent a man to the moon not so long ago. And
it's an incredibly social device.
So we're going from a world where people were interacting with Facebook a
number of years ago mostly on desktop to people carrying around this incredibly
mobile and social device all day long. And that's a big opportunity for us. We go
from getting 1 in 7 minutes in the US on the desktop to 1 in 5 minutes on the mobile
phone. And so we're just much more a part of peoples' lives.
And as we focus on transitioning our product and building our business, we've had 3
core things we focused on to make the mobile business transition.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-12
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 4 of 20Heather Bellini
David EbersmanThe ﬁrst is really capitalizing on that transition. We had opportunities over the last 6
quarters to prioritize ads that were going into newsfeeds or ads that would be on the
right-hand side. And we've prioritized the ads that were going into mobile so that we
were really doubling down on the future of our business, even at the expense in
some ways of the current things we were doing.
The second thing we've really focused on is increasing our advertiser base. Our
ability to show you an ad that's relevant, that's meaningful for you is greatly
increased by how many advertisers we have and how many ads they're running. And
so we've worked with all of our brands, all of our marketing segments from brands,
to DR, to our response, to developers, to SMB, small-to-medium sized businesses, to
build our business with them so we have the demand we need for the inventory we
have.
Then the third is really investing in our ad products. Three things within that,
targeting, make the ads more relevant, measurement so that people could measure
not just the clicks they were getting right from an ad but returns to in-store sales
based on seeing our ads. And ease of use, making our ads easier to buy, easier to
understand, easier to use.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
David, there's been a lot of focus on ad load. What's the right rate to optimize
growth? How do you think about it?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
Well I mean it wasn't that long ago that we didn't have any ads in newsfeeds. So as
we started to introduce ads into newsfeed and to ramp up the number that we
showed, we were facing some really interesting and important questions in terms of
how the ads would perform and what the impact would be on the engagements
from people who are using Facebook.
And I think one of the most important and positive things that happened for us in
2013 was how positively we could answer those questions. So as we increased the
number of ads that we put in newsfeed, the ads continue to perform really well for
marketers. Newsfeed ads work and they work really well.
Just as important or more important is the limited or negligible impact that we've
had on engagement on Facebook as ads have ramped up. So we talked about some
engagement stats on the yearend call and just how well that's going and how that
increased over 2013. And Mark shared a speciﬁc data point that I think is really
encouraging, which is one of the things that we do is we survey users. We're
constantly asking questions, trying to understand how they use our product, what
they like, what they don't like. And one question that we'll frequently ask is about
their sentiment about ads.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-12
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 5 of 20Sheryl Sandberg
Heather BelliniAnd if you look at the feedback we got from people who use Facebook on that
question, who use Facebook on mobile devices, that actually got better over the
second half of 2013, even as the number of ads went up because we think we were
really doing it deliberately and carefully and successfully. So it's been really a great
experience thus far getting to where we are today.
Now looking forward, the number of ads in newsfeed is an important variable. But
it's certainly not the only variable that matters and it's not a variable that we're
focused on optimizing in and of itself. So we're also looking at things like the
prominence of the ads we show, the positioning of the ads, the size of the ads, the
format of the ads. And all of this goes into trying to ﬁnd the right balance in terms of
the experience and the beneﬁts that we can oﬀer to marketers and the best user
experience, the best experience for people who are using the product. And we'll try
to optimize across all of those things going forward.
What I think is deﬁnitely true is what we've said before. We're not going to continue
to increase the number of ads in newsfeed looking forward the way we did in 2013.
But what we are going to focus on that we think is more important and critical for us
to continue to grow the business is the quality of the ads that we show. If we can get
ads that are better targeted, higher quality, more relevant, we can bring more value
to marketers and do so in a way that really contributes to the user experience.
You know our aspiration here is for the ads to be as engaging and as good as the
organic content that you ﬁnd shared by your friends. And that really -- that gets us to
a place that's a really solid foundation for us to continue to grow the business from.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
And it's an interesting thing because when you have an ad that's really relevant for
you, it's a great experience and you don't have the concern people have around
things like ad load. We had a meeting earlier and someone here told us that he saw
an ad either during the Super Bowl or right after and he loved it so much he showed
his wife. That's the kind of experience -- it was actually the Coke America the
Beautiful ad. Some people saw it running during the Super Bowl. It's an interesting
case.
That ad was such a good experience for him that he wanted to show his wife, which
is great. That ad ran on the Super Bowl at the same time Coke ran ads on Facebook
to continue the conversation and engage the community around Facebook and had
great results. And importantly the ad was of such high quality that for him, I don't
know how many posts he actually sees on Facebook that he shows his wife. But I bet
you it's not that many, which meant that that ad was really high quality which is great.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Sheryl, how should we think about public content on Facebook and can you give
people a ﬂavor of what you're doing here and why it matters?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-12
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)

Sheryl Sandberg{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
Facebook starts as friends' content. And there's a lot of friend content that happens.
There's also more public sharing on Facebook then I think everyone is aware. A lot of
people are sharing things publically. And a lot of people are participating in public
conversations.
So there was a report put out yesterday by SecondSync. And they said that for a
bunch of time, kind of 1 in every 4th person in some instances was on TV is also
talking about that content on Facebook. And a lot of that sharing is happening
syncronicively [ph] at the same time.
We look at public ﬁgures interacting with their community and their fans on
Facebook. Big thing for us is Beyonce launched her album on Facebook a couple
months ago. So sounds obvious now. But people don't launch albums just on
Facebook and Instagram, they do press tours. And they have big distribution deals,
et cetera. And all she did was launch on Facebook and Instagram. She didn't answer
a single question to the press, just a couple of user questions on Instagram. And that
album is doing incredibly well. And in those ﬁrst three days when this was all they
did to support it, broke every iTunes record.
Now obviously she gets a lot of credit because. But her team's decision -- it's
probably a great album. But her team's decision to launch only on Facebook was
about going directly to their fans and wanting to go directly and release their album
in a way that was as close to their community as possible. And it worked. There was
an enormous amount of activity.
And so we're really focused on continuing to enable private sharing, as David said.
But also other forms of sharing such as engagement with public ﬁgures,
engagement with public content. We rolled out hashtags. Some people may have
seen trending topics on your homepage now. Those are things which help us surface
and engage people in public content. And they're important for us.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Another question for you. Brand advertising is an area that you've said in the past is
moving a little bit more slowly than I think you would have expected. What do you
think the reason is for this and what helps accelerate the pace of adoption?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
The brand out of the big market. I don't need to tell this community that. This is $300
billion plus every year. Very robust. And a lot of the money is not very well spent. The
old adage which I think comes from the 50s of I'm wasting half my ad budget but I
don't know which half, people still tell that joke. And it's still kind of true.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-12
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 7 of 20And so I think we have a really big opportunity here. We're deﬁnitely making
progress. Our brand segment is growing as all our segments are. Every one of the
global ad age 100 advertise with us over the last year. And they're pretty cyclical.
That said, these budgets move slowly. If 12% of consumer media time is being spent
on mobile now, it's 3% of mobile ad budgets. The opportunity we have is to oﬀer
what is a pretty unique opportunity and then show that we can measure it.
We oﬀer personalized marketing at an unprecedented scale. So the scale is there.
750 million people visit Facebook every day. If you were a brand and you bought a
Super Bowl ad in the Super Bowl, you reached on average 112 million people. You
can buy that on us any day in the United States. So we have that broad reach and
people are using it.
But maybe even more exciting than that is our ability to do personalized marketing
at scale. You can also buy on Facebook ads that reach 32 million people who
regularly buy premium groceries. Or 25 million people who are in the market for
dog food or dog products. And I'm assuming therefore have a dog. But we can tell
you who the dog owners are, who's in the market for certain types of cars. And so
you can do this much more targeted, much more personalized marketing. But also at
pretty broad scale.
Then that only works if we can measure it. And that's where I think we've made some
real strides in the last year and we're very focused on investing for the future. When
we were measuring our ads a year ago, two years ago, we could tell you okay, this
group of people saw Facebook ads, this group didn't. Here's the lift in brand metrics.
Here's the lift in their sentiments. But we couldn't measure it all the way through to
ringing the cash register.
And we're a new industry. We're not TV. We're not search. We have to prove it. And
we should have to prove it because we take our clients by just in time seriously. We
should earn every dollar we spend. And increasingly over the last year we've done
the work and gotten the data to work in a privacy protective way that we can say
okay, these households saw ads, these households didn't. Here's the spend increase.
These people saw ads, these people didn't. Here's the spend increase.
And our job is to go client by client with the big ones, the branders, pound the
pavement and prove those results.
A couple of years ago you could be a CMO in this country and not have a Facebook
strategy or not even use Facebook and that was ﬁne. Today you have to have a
Facebook strategy. But if you talk to our early adopters, the people who are going
bigger with us, they'll say yes, Facebook's driving real ad sales and we're really
putting more resources against it. Then you can talk to some of our other clients
where we're still much more in the introductory phases. But for all of them what's
going to move them down the spending funnel is measurement.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-12

Sheryl SandbergIf we can show them that the dollar they invested with Facebook drives in-store sales
and online sales better or as well as anything else. And I think we can show them
that, we're increasingly showing our clients that, I think we'll move the dollars faster.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
We were talking earlier about the look-back videos and just thinking of the 750
million people that access Facebook every day. Can you kind of share with us the
response you had to that as part of the 10-year anniversary?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
Oh, it was amazing. I'm wondering, how many people watched their look-back video
here? So it was really incredible. We launched these videos, for those who didn't see
it, it's your look back. So it's kind of your experience on Facebook 1 minute set to
music.
Almost 200 million people watched it and 50% of the people who watched their
own video shared it. And it really -- it did 2 things I think. It showed the power of the
Facebook brand that, as I watched those videos. And I have to admit spent -- not
wasted time of course. Facebook is never a waste of time. Maybe a few more hours
than I had the other night watching other people's look-back videos, sending my
friends private messages, where's your look-back video? Share it. I'm missing it.
But you really felt close to Facebook and you felt close to the people in your life that
you could see this is when I joined, this was the picture that was most viewed or most
people liked. And that was a just a really cool and personal experience. And I think
we do touch people on a personal way.
I don't know if we've been historically that good at helping them see that. But I think
we're focused on that and we're really focused there. And you'll see more from us
there.
And the second thing is it's the power of virality. We bought no TV ads. We didn't
advertise this at all. We showed people their look-back video and enabled them to
share, which got people to watch it, which got them to download their own look-
back video. And that is really exciting to see something go this viral and have this
much impact.

David Ebersman{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
No. Yes, exactly. Being the money guy, how do we think about Facebook's long-term
operating margin proﬁle?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
Yes. I have to digest Sheryl's insult ﬁrst.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
I think it's a compliment. Isn't it a compliment?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
I think the starting point is that Facebook is still a really young company and we're
still very much in investment mode. So we're looking to make the kind of
investments that can help us continue to grow and continue to build the Company.
Having said that, what we try to do is to be really disciplined and to make sure every
dollar that we spend in the business is spent well in terms of helping us to serve a
customer and to create value. And really to force tradeoﬀs so that we don't take
advantage of the fact that the business is growing quickly to invest in a manner that's
unfocused.
We tend to think about the money we're spending in kind of 4 diﬀerent buckets. Let
me go through those for a second. The ﬁrst is infrastructure. So the servers and the
datacenters and the other technology that enables us to serve Facebook to
everyone around the world who wants to use it quickly and reliably. These are
investments that we need to make, that we want to make. They're critical to building
the Company.
At the same time we spent a lot of time and a lot of money trying to make our
infrastructure more eﬃcient over the last few years. And that investment has really
paid oﬀ. We have a great team of people working on this. They've invested in
programs like the Open Compute Project that have helped us to bring forward major
changes in the servers, in the datacenters. And improvements in how they work that
have saved us over $1 billion over the last three years.
And we're going to continue to make those kinds of investments to try and make
sure that even though it's a compute-heavy business, we have an eﬃcient
infrastructure.
The second area that we think about is product development, or R&D. And R&D we
want to invest in. Our future depends on our investing in R&D. But one of the things
that we feel is very true is that R&D success is not about quantity, it's about quality.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-12
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 10 of 20It's about investing in the right things. And R&D for us is really about people. That's
what we spend our R&D money on.
So if you look back over the last few years, purely from a ﬁnancial standpoint we
could have aﬀorded to grow R&D more quickly than we did. So the rate limiting step
for us was how fast could we grow it and maintain the quality bar that we felt was
important so that we were hiring the right people and that we were prepared in
terms of our management systems and processes to integrate them so that they
could contribute and be productive.
And we really decided on the rate of R&D growth based on what we felt was the
maximum we could grow without putting those things in our culture at risk. And we
have a bigger R&D organization today than we've ever had before. Really look
forward to seeing what we can build with that organization and continuing to grow it
at an appropriately measured pace.
The last 2 categories of spend for us, the ﬁrst is marketing and sales. The concepts
here are similar to pretty much any company. We're trying to make the investments
we need to make to bring the right level of customer demand in.
The only think I'd say is that because of the vision and commitment that people like
Sheryl had in the early days to building as much as the product as possible, as much
of the marketing and sales products as possible to be self-service, it's really scaled
remarkably well.
So the vast majority of our advertisers come in to the system through their
computers. And the investment we have to make in terms of spend to support them
is just markedly low. It's a tremendously eﬃcient business because early on we built
something that could scale so well.
And we're trying to do the same thing on the G&A side, which is the fourth and last
category I was going to mention. Obviously we want to spend as little there as we
need to, to support the business. And we've been very aggressive in investing in the
systems and technologies that can enable us to build a business that was over $7.8
billion in revenue with a couple hundred people in our G&A organization. And we're
really proud of that and hope to continue at that kind of trajectory.
So I think we're pleased with where we are. The fact that our GAAP operating
margins in 2013 were 36% is terriﬁc. I think even more important though, we're
pleased with the returns we're getting on the spend that we made.
So if we think about the things we invested in, in 2013 that improved the quality of
our mobile products, that brought forward new advertising support that helped us to
bring more demand into the system, that made our infrastructure more eﬃcient. All
of these things really had a nice return that helped set us up for the future.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-12

Sheryl SandbergLooking forward, I don't know what our margin will be in the years to come because
it depends on revenue growth and the investment opportunities that we have. We're
going to make the investments that we think are important to building a great
company. We also think that Facebook, because of the general nature of what we're
building and who we are, has the opportunity to be a really proﬁtable and high-
margin business over time.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
One thing that's been really interesting if you do the story of Facebook, I think it's
fair to say the story of the last ﬁve years is a story of a company growing up.
I remember when David joined 4-1/2 years ago. And he wanted to do a 3-year
budget. And we looked at him like he was insane. A 3-year budget? I mean I'll be
glad if I can predict 3 weeks. I've got quotas out to my sales team for three months.
But we made it a hacky-- he got me there, he was like we're going to do it as a hack-
a-thon project. We have these hack-a-thon projects where people stay up all night.
It's the ﬁrst and only one I've ever done in my six years at Facebook but we did it. I
went home at like 10:30, which is late for me. But we did it. And by morning we
actually had a draft of something that became a really rigorous 3-year budget plan.
And David's focus on helping us build our business in a scalable way has been a
huge part of what's happened and what's been just transformative for Facebook.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
That was a good makeup for the comment before.

The other thing wasn't even a --

So because it was so nice I'm tempted not to mention that the hack-a-thon started at
9 and Sheryl went home at 10:30.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
True. But I still had to stay up past my bedtime. Like I would have started at 6. But no
one wanted to start at 6. So it's true. I was only there for an hour and a half. But I
gave great insight in that hour and a half, really. I was super helpful.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-12

Sheryl Sandberg{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Sheryl, you have more than a million advertisers using Facebook today and over 25
million small businesses with Facebook pages. Obviously that speaks to a massive
opportunity in the SMB segment. But how do you see the market evolving if you look
out over the next 3 to ﬁve years?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
I'm really passionate about the SMB segment. I have been since my Google days. It's
often referred to by people as the Holy Grail of online marketing or digital
marketing. If you could just get every small business online, look what a market
you'd have.
But small businesses move online slowly and adopt technology slowly. And some
really real percentage, I don't know, 30% to 40% of US small businesses probably
don't have a webpage.
One of the things I think we have a strong competitive advantage in, in Facebook is
that we are a product that is so broadly used by consumers. And it's the same
product really when you're an advertiser.
So at 1.2 billion people, most of the people who own small businesses in the United
States have proﬁles. Then they see posts from other businesses and they're like, oh,
people are posting about their business, I should post about mine. Then they set up
a business page which is free. And really the same process of setting up your proﬁle.
So it's easy. We have 25 million active small business pages globally. And obviously
we're pretty scalable. We don't call 25 million people, they're just coming to us
online.
And any opportunity we have that we have really focused on in the last year is
converting more of them into being paid advertisers and then over time converting
those paid advertisers into spending more. We dramatically simpliﬁed our ad
products over the last year.
A year ago we would have said to a small business by posting on their page would
you like to become an advertiser? And that can be a daunting task. Now if a small
business does a page that gets good likes, we then say do you want to spend $5 to
promote that post? That's a much easier lift and now they're an advertiser. And once
they see the returns we believe and we've seen that they'll hopefully continue to
invest.
And so the process of getting SMBs online, Facebook's already doing on its own,
which is fantastic. And now we have the opportunity to make our ad products simple

Sheryl SandbergOne of the happiest things I get to do is when I meet with our clients and I see
businesses that are really completely grown on Facebook. There's this great
cupcake, store is not the right word, cupcake company in DC. They have these
trucks. They started oﬀ with one. They post what street they're going to be on, on
Facebook and Twitter. They then ask people what ﬂavors they want and where they
want them to show up. Now they have 5 trucks, they employ a bunch of people. And
they drive around selling cupcakes using only social media to promote it. It's pretty
exciting.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
One other question for you. You've played a key leadership role at critical
development stages for 2 of some of the most powerful companies of the last
decade. What have you learned about managing large organizations that grow
rapidly and innovate even faster that maybe you could share with us?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
I guess probably 2 things come to mind. The ﬁrst is mission. And everyone says that.
Oh, we're a mission-based company. But I actually think some companies are
mission-based companies and they mean it and it matters and it works.
Facebook's a very mission-based company. We are there because we believe there's
a human universal, universal human desire to share, that sharing makes our lives
better. For those of you, hopefully everyone, who are Facebook users think about
your birthday before and after Facebook. The ﬁrst year you're on Facebook and it's
your birthday, it's like the lights are turned on. Everyone all of a sudden knows it's
your birthday. And it's a really warm experience and it makes your life just a little bit
diﬀerent and a little friendly.
And I think we are hiring people and focused on that mission. And I think as one of
the leaders in the Company, what David and Mark and I talk about and try to do is
just never get tired of talking about the mission. You could talk about it all day, you
could talk about it again the next day. And you have to keep talking about it so that
you're focusing everyone on the right things. And we really do that. We take that to
heart. And our 10th anniversary celebration was just one example.
The other thing is really ruthless prioritizations, that when you are growing it can look
like the world has endless possibilities and people can get sloppy with resources.
And you can decide to try to do everything. And we really don't do that. We try to
ﬁgure out what really matters.
One of the ways we operationalize this is we run our teams by having goals and non-
goals. So teams for the half -- we do it usually by half year, have their goals. And then
often they have a non-goal. And a non-goal is something that's a really good idea
that we don't have the resources to do to prioritize right now.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-12

Page 14 of 20Heather Bellini
David EbersmanNow if a non-goal is a bad idea it doesn't help. But if it's a really good idea. So until
very recently when we launched our ads test, our non-goal for the ads team was an
ad network. Ad network's always been a good idea for Facebook. We have great
demand for it from both the publishing side and the advertising side. But we had so
much of our own inventory. And we still do, that it wasn't the most important thing to
do.
And that really works as a prioritization formula because you can watch the ads team
having conversations. And you'll see one person say to the other well that's a really
good idea. Then the person will say oh. But it's not as good of an idea as an ad
network and we're not doing that. Oﬀ the table and stay focused.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Last question, David, before we turn it over to the audience. And there will be 4
roaming mic’s. Teen usage comes up all the time. If I talk to teens today they will tell
me they spend a lot less time on IM and they spend a lot more time using Instagram
Direct. Can you talk about the vision of the Company as you introduce these types of
applications and how they have diﬀerent use cases for people and how they're
leveraging them?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
Well I think that as we imagine a world where we build oﬀ the foundation we have
with Facebook and Instagram and Messenger and improve those products and
bring other products forward, we want to make it easy for people to have the sharing
experiences that they want to have. And the products will be built to try and
accommodate making that experience as easy and rewarding as possible.
So Messenger's a really good example. Messenger used to exist within the Facebook
core application. And it worked there. You could message people from it. But it took
some eﬀort because there was a lot in the application. You had to go open the
application, wait for it to load, then go ﬁnd the messaging part. And then send your
message. And when you have a message to send someone, it's more -- it's a better
experience if you can just quickly click, it loads, you send the message. And you're
done.
The new standalone messaging app that we have allows you to do that much more
easily, much more productively. So we're going to try and build -- the things we build
will be targeted towards cases where we think people want to share certain kinds of
content in certain ways.
What we will also learn as we launch these things is people may not use them exactly
as we predicted. And then we can learn from that behavior as well and sort of take
that back into our product development eﬀort and capitalize on what we're seeing.
So an example of a product that's been fun to watch is a products called Groups that
we have that allows you to share with a sort of semi-permanent group of people. NotFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-12

A - Heather Bellinipermanent in the sense you can't come in and come out. But it exists and you can
stay a part of a certain kind of community, be it a soccer team or a band or
something much bigger.
And we launched Groups something like four years ago. And it wasn't like in the ﬁrst
week or the ﬁrst month it became a product that everybody used. But over time as it
became clear what kinds of use cases it enabled and how rewarding it could be,
what we recently announced is we have over half a billion people who use Groups
over the last month. So it's just been a consistent sort of -- I don't know exactly how
to describe it. But by people using it they introduced it to other people by including
them in their groups, et cetera. And it's become a really successful product for us.
So our product development sort of ﬂows from both directions. Very purposeful in
terms of bring use cases forward that we think are important. And then very reactive
to what we see in terms of the behavior of the people who are using Facebook.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
With that, there are 4 mic’s around the room. I think there's a question right up here.
Thanks. If you think about Facebook as a utility, $120 a month for cable, $10 a month
for Netﬂix, what's the utility per user?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
Endless. I mean immeasurable. How can you measure this kind of happiness?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
Well I think that there's -- I don't know if you're asking the question from sort of the
abstract sense of how would you think about that conceptually, which is something
we've talked about. I mean, it actually comes up periodically in internal
conversations and we try and sort of think it through. But it's hard to think through
because we don't have the marketplace that gives you the measurement.
And I don't think we should. I mean Facebook being free is one of the reasons why
it's grown to be 1.2 billion people. And I think it's been absolutely the right strategy
to put as little friction as we possibly can between you discovering what Facebook is
and experiencing it. Because when you experience it and see how it can make your
life richer, more interesting. And more valuable, you want to use it more, in a way
that I don't think we could describe our market with a price associated with it and
get to the same outcome.

By the way I love Paper app.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
Thank you. We love it too.
My Flipboard usage on iPad or iPhone was largely newsfeed from Facebook into
Paper. So how has been the learning from the last week of inclusion [ph] on Paper
and how people are using it and what kind of ads would be serving them?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
I can go ﬁrst. It's a weekend. So what we have resembles the public feedback you
can read in the app stores, which is really positive. So the early feedback's been
great. It's a beautiful product. I encourage all of you to download it and use it. This is
Paper if you couldn't hear the question. It's a lovely product. We look forward to
seeing how it progresses in the months ahead. But way too early for us to pretend
we have a lot of knowledge in terms of how people will use it.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
There's one here. Sorry.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
And in terms of ads in it, when we launch products we are willing to invest for a long
time before we put ads in. It's quite easy to see how ads could ﬁt into that or any
other similar service. But there's no reason for us to do that right now. We have so
much to do with the current -- monetizing the current products we have.
Hi. Paul [ph] from Point Capital. Now my 17-year-old nephew right now spends about
4 hours a day texting to his girlfriend back and forth. He's not on Facebook really any
more. He occasionally checks it but 4 hours a day on texting. So I'm trying to ﬁgure
out what's your strategy on capturing the younger crowd that might be going to
diﬀerent kind of communication right now?
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
They're going to Instagram Direct.

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantSo reducing friction in products is really important. One of the reasons Messenger
became a standalone app and is doing so well, we've seen 70% growth in three
months, is that taking it out of the main Facebook app and reducing the extra clicks
to get from the Facebook app to Messenger makes a big diﬀerent with a form of
communication that's this quick.
As David said, we think about the diﬀerent types of sharing people want to do.
There's a bunch of one-to-one sharing. There's a bunch of one-to-group sharing like
small groups. There's a bunch of public sharing. And our goal is to build products
that engage all of our users including teens so that they are actively sharing on
Facebook.
The French president tomorrow, I understand he's a charmer, how are you and
Google and Apple, whoever's there, going to defend the abnormally low tax rates
that these companies pay in Europe?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
Yes. So Sheryl will be meeting with him but I will take the tax question. The ﬁrst thing
I'd say is our tax rate last year was in the mid 40% range. So I'm not sure we can be
lumped in to having an abnormally low tax rate. The dynamic of what companies
have built, which I think is consistent with how the tax law has always been written
and interpreted is that proﬁts are allocated based on where the valuable activities
are taking place. And it's always been the case that countries have argued about
what that split is.
So as you try to apportion what percentage of your proﬁts should be attributable to
activities in this country versus that country, it's been an argument that has been
ongoing for as long as I've been involved in ﬁnance.
I think what's changed recently is just the nature of the government deﬁcits in lots of
countries has caused them to be more aggressive in the conversation. And that's
something that we certainly are well aware of earlier in the process of building out
our international tax structures than some of the companies you described.

A - David EbersmanSuper Bowl of online advertising that requires a lot of scale and budget or whether
you segmented the business sizes when you think about the advertising
opportunities?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
We want to do both. And we're still in the early process of building the tools which
enable that. It is a very scalable model for us that a lot of companies can come on
and buy ads. We've taken some really good simpliﬁcation steps in the last year or so.
So it used to be that we would sell our products and then as our products
proliferated we'd be asking you do you want to promote a page post [ph] ad? Do
you want a page post [ph] ad? Do you want a right-hand column ad? Do you want a
newsfeed ad?
And now we go in and if you go into our advertiser ﬂow, we ask you what you're
trying to accomplish. Do you want clicks? Do you want sales? Do you want likes? And
we are trying to then help make the decisions for you, which is much easier of here
are the products that will deliver the highest ROI for whatever your goals are.
I think as we do that, as we get better at helping people enable the products, we
should make it very easy. And I'll take your card because we're happy to help you
scale.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
There's a question here and then there's one way in the back.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
Never want to leave any money on the table.
Sheryl and David, when you were talking about the question about the 10-year
vision, you mentioned the additional ways that you're going to be allowing people
to share diﬀerent types of content and the technologies that would facilitate that. Is
there any vision in the Company that you can share with us on going beyond sharing
and communication and actually allowing transactions to be done on Facebook
platform? And if so, what advantages do you think it can bring for me to buy things,
get things done through Facebook?
And I mean by transactions that are originated by the consumer. I don't mean
advertisers pushing and then you allow people to buy through it. But is there a
possibility down the line for me to be able to actually do things from within
Facebook within reason that there's an advantage to do it rather than to go to
Google or Amazon or Expedia or elsewhere?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
I mean what we've seen to date is a limited amount of that kind of behavior
happening with the functionality that the product currently oﬀers. So for example aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-12

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Sheryl Sandbergpage making a post but then saying if you want this product message us, or
something like that. Or you can do it as an individual.
So we do see some people using the power of the platform to stimulate transactions
and commerce. We haven't yet found the sort of the product idea or the use case
that we think ﬁts most naturally and will work best for us to sort of make that even
easier and for us to potentially participate in those transactions. Obviously it's the
kind of thing that we're open minded to considering over time. But right now I think
-- I mean we feel like we're in a pretty good position in terms of focusing on what we
have built and making it better and creating experiences that are as engaging as
Facebook is so we bring 750 million people back every day, they spend as much
time with us as they do. And then leveraging that in terms of helping brands and
products and companies to communicate with the people who are spending time
with us.
So that sort of approach to building the business seems to be working well for us
today and we're staying pretty focused on it.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Okay. The last question I think right there in the back.
Yes, hi. It's Kyle Jenkins from Wonkley [ph]. Sheryl, I thought your comments around
measuring ads from actually seeing one on Facebook, making a purchase in a brick
and mortar business, I'd like to better understand how do you guys do that today.
But more importantly where do you want to be in 3 to ﬁve years with doing that?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
So our goal in 3 to ﬁve years or even before that is we want to be and we think we
are by far the best -- we are by far the best mobile ad product out there today. And
we want to be able to prove to all our clients the ROI that we think we deliver. And as
we get more targeted we can increasingly deliver.
The way we connect the data is we've worked through a third party named
Datalogic. What they do is they take customer data from a company. So they take it
from a supermarket or a brick and mortar store, they take our data, they mix it
together so that we can measure the results. They never give us the data from the
retailer. They never give the retailer our data. So it's privacy protected for everyone.
But we can then measure results. Because what they're getting from us is here's who
saw the ad. And what they're getting from the retailer is here's the purchase price.
So you know, with this we were able to measure with Bud Light that they reached I
forget. But a good chunk, a large percentage of the US population with 1 ad they did.
And they increased their purchasing in US households by 3.3%.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-12

A - Heather BelliniAnyone who's been in the ad business, that's a lot for a product that's very well
known. And we were able to connect that to who had seen the ads and who wasn't.
We're still not doing that with every ad campaign. We're far from it. We've done
about 100 studies with diﬀerent partners and we're still -- we have a long way to go
in terms of targeting and in terms of measurement.
But I think the personalized marketing at scale, the ability to do broad reach like
Coke is doing with the Super Bowl on Facebook. But also target to speciﬁc
demographics, separate out your current customers from your hopefully future
customers, segment out the diﬀerent things you want to share with diﬀerent people.
And enable that to go viral, gives us a really big opportunity as long as we can
continue to scale the measurement. And so we're really focused on that.
