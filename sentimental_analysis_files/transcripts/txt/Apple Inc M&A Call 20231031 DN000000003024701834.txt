{BIO 19052877 <GO>}
Welcome to my lab. Apple Silicon has completely redeﬁned the Mac laptop
experience. Every aspects of its architecture is designed for performance and power
eﬃciency. Our state-of-the-art designs pack tremendous performance and
capabilities into a very small chip, which is ideal for our amazing laptops. The
industry-leading power eﬃciency of Apple Silicon results in extraordinary battery life
and phenomenal performance, whether you're plugged in or not. And with
advanced technologies like the Uniﬁed Memory Architecture, Neural Engine and
Media Engine, Macs can do things, no other laptops can do.
Tonight, we're doing something we haven't done before as we bring our latest
technologies to a broader set of users more rapidly than ever. We are launching the
next generation of Apple Silicon for the Mac by debuting three breakthrough chips
at the same time. Introducing M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. They feature a number ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-31

Page 2 of 8groundbreaking technologies and show how far Apple Silicon for the Mac has come
since the debut of the M1 family. To start, they are the ﬁrst chips for a personal
computer built using the industry-leading three-nanometer technology. Utilizing
state-of-the-art extreme ultraviolet lithography, three-nanometer technology creates
transistors that are so small, you could ﬁt 2 million of them in the cross-section of a
human hair. We use these cutting-edge transistors to advance every component of
these new chips to deliver increased performance and new features to every chip in
the family.
The biggest advancement comes with the GPU. The M3 family of chips introduces a
next-generation GPU that takes the largest leap forward in graphics architecture ever
for Apple Silicon. It starts with a new micro-architecture that has a breakthrough
feature, we call Dynamic Caching, an industry-ﬁrst. In a traditional graphics
architecture, software determines the amount of local GPU memory that's allocated
to upcoming tasks at compiled time. This results in reserving the same amount of
memory for every task based on the needs of the single most demanding task,
which means the GPU is underutilized, especially with complex programs. In our
next-generation GPU, local memory gets dynamically allocated in hardware in real-
time. So only the exact amount of memory that is needed is used for each task. This
dramatically increases the average utilization of the GPU, which signiﬁcantly
increases performance for the most demanding pro apps and games. This is an
industry-ﬁrst, transparent to developers, and the cornerstone of our new GPU
architecture.
This next-generation GPU also brings new rendering features to Apple Silicon like
hardware-accelerated mesh shading. Mesh shading brings greater capability and
eﬃciency to geometry processing, enabling more visually complex scenes. Finally,
the new GPU architecture brings hardware-accelerated ray tracing to the Mac for the
ﬁrst time. Ray tracing models the physical properties of light as it interacts with a
scene, enabling games to render more accurate shadows and reﬂections to create
more realistic environments. And pro 3D rendering apps can produce stunning ray-
traced visuals faster than ever. In fact, the combination of hardware-accelerated ray
tracing and the new graphics architecture allows pro apps to deliver up to 2.5 times
faster rendering performance than the M1 family of chips. This is a monstrous
improvement for the most demanding graphics tasks. This new GPU architecture is a
breakthrough and will bring a whole new level of graphics performance to the Mac.
Now let's look at the M3 family's next-generation CPU cores. The performance cores
are up to 30% faster than the M1 family while maintaining their fantastic power
eﬃciency. And the eﬃciency cores take an even bigger leap in performance for
many typical tasks up to 50% faster. We've added these architecture and
performance improvements while maintaining our industry-leading performance per
watt.
Let's look at how far we've come since the M1. This architecture is able to deliver the
same multi-threaded CPU performance as M1 with just half the power. And the GPU
is able to deliver the same performance as the M1 using nearly half the power as
well. These are tremendous gains in performance per watt. Now, when we compareFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-31
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 3 of 8John Ternusit against the latest 12-core PC laptop chip, it delivers the same CPU performance
using just one-quarter of the power. And when we compare it to the GPU
performance of that chip, it delivers the same performance using just one-ﬁfth of the
power. It's incredible. M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max also have a faster and more eﬃcient
neural engine, that is a breathtaking 60% faster than the M1 family, making AI even
faster while keeping data on device to preserve privacy. The M3 family has also our
advanced media engine for hardware acceleration of the most popular video
codecs. And now it includes support for everyone, enabling power-eﬃcient playback
of streaming video from YouTube, Netﬂix, and other services.
The state-of-the-art technologies in the M3 family of chips result in a huge leap
forward for Apple Silicon for the Mac. And with our scalable architecture, we tailor
each M series chip for diﬀerent user needs, delivering best-in-class features to every
user. Starting with the M3 chip, which delivers phenomenal performance for our
most popular systems. It features an eight-core CPU and our next-generation 10-core
GPU and is up to 65% faster than M1. M3 Pro scales up that design with increased
capabilities for users who need even more performance. It has a 12-core CPU, an 18-
core GPU and is up to 40% faster than M1 Pro. And ﬁnally, M3 Max takes it even
further to deliver a tremendous leap in performance for the most demanding pro
workloads. It features a 16-core CPU and a 40-core GPU and it now supports up to a
massive 128 gigabyte of uniﬁed memory, enabling AI developers to work with even
larger transformer models with billions of parameters. M3 Max is up to 80% faster
than M1 Max. That's a giant leap in performance in just two years. So that's the
groundbreaking M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max.
With three-nanometer technology, a next-generation GPU architecture, a higher-
performance CPU, faster neural engine, and support for even more uniﬁed memory,
they're the most advanced chips ever built for a personal computer. Now to tell you
about the incredible new products that get these new chips, I'll hand it over to John.

The new MacBook Pro is scary fast. And with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max, there's a
perfect model for everyone. Let's begin with the 14-inch MacBook Pro. It now starts
with the M3 chip, making it the ideal laptop for users pursuing their passions.
Whether you're a student, entrepreneur, creator, or a combination of all three, you'll
ﬁnd everyday tasks lightning fast. And when you're using pro apps or playing games,
the advanced thermal system allows you to sustain the phenomenal performance of
M3. In fact, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 is up to 60% faster than the 13-inch
MacBook Pro with M1. So it's great for working with demanding content across a
variety of workﬂows, such as making intricate 3D models in SketchUp faster than
before, or viewing and interacting with large
Medical images in surgical AR with stunning detail on the XDR display. And
hardware-accelerated ray tracing enables gameplay with incredibly realistic lighting,
shadows, and reﬂections in games like Myst.
Next, let's talk about the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro with M3 Pro, which provides
even greater performance and additional uniﬁed memory for users with more
demanding workﬂows like coders, creative pros, and researchers. With M3 Pro,
MacBook Pro is up to 40% faster than the 16-inch model with M1 Pro. So stitching
together and manipulating enormous panoramic photos in Photoshop is much
quicker. Working on large and complex data models in MATLAB is more ﬂuid. And
compiling and testing millions of lines of code in Xcode is even faster. And MacBook
Pro with M3 Pro can do all of this while also driving two external high-resolution
displays.
Now, let's turn to MacBook Pro with M3 Max. For users with extreme workﬂows, like
AI developers, 3D artists, and video professionals, it's an absolute beast. It provides
performance and capabilities that push the limits of computing. With M3 Max, it's up
to 2.5 times faster than the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M1 Max. Thanks to the next-
generation GPU architecture in M3 Max, you can model and iterate remarkably
complex 3D content in Cinema 4D with Redshift. And you can do it faster than ever,
even while away from the studio. In video post-production work on the highest-
resolution content, in apps like DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro, or Final Cut Pro is an
absolute breeze, thanks to two ProRes engines.
MacBook Pro with M3 Max also supports up to an enormous 128 gigabytes of uniﬁed
memory. We ﬁrst introduced support for this amount of memory on the powerful
Mac Studio with M1 Ultra. And now, just 18 months later, we're bringing it to
MacBook Pro. This enables creators to easily work on large and complex projects
spanning multiple pro apps and plugins, like Substance 3D Painter, Maya, and
Arnold. Or compose huge ﬁlm scores with Pro Tools, where entire orchestral libraries
are instantly available from memory. MacBook Pro with M3 Max can drive four high-
resolution external displays, providing a vast amount of screen real estate for users
who need an even larger canvas. And all models of the MacBook Pro deliver theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-31
