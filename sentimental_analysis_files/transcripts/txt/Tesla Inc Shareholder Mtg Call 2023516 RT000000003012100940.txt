Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's 2023
Annual Shareholder Meeting in Austin, Texas. My name is Martin Viecha, I'm Vice
President of Investor Relations, and I will be the Chair of today's meeting.
First of all, I really wanted to thank everyone who continues to do this trip on annual
basis and shows up every time. It's really quite something that we have a following as
dedicated as this. So thank you very much for that.
I also wanted to thank our ﬁrst-time visitors. I know that many of you won a lottery to
come for the ﬁrst time to a Tesla shareholder meeting. You'll probably notice that,
unlike many other shareholder meetings of other companies, this one tends to be a
bit more fun. So, hope you enjoy that.
But the last thing I really wanted to say is that just thank you so much for all your
support over the years. We really feel like you're part of our mission, part of our story,
and it's something we truly, truly value. So thank you so much for that.
There will be two parts of today's meeting. First, the formal part of the meeting
where we will cover items that stockholders have been asked to vote on, as well as
any other matters that are properly presented. And after the voting, I will introduce
Tesla's Co-Founder and CEO and techno king, Elon Musk, who will give a
presentation about Tesla's year in review.
But at this time, I'd like to thank the members of the Tesla team and the Board who
are here with us here today. A representative from PricewaterhouseCoopers, Tesla'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16

But before we begin, I'd like to introduce you to Tesla's chair, Robyn Denholm, who
would like to say a few words.
{BIO 5964382 <GO>}
I'm a little bit shorter. So, hello, everyone. On behalf of the Board, I am really
honored to welcome you all here today to the 2023 Annual Shareholder Meeting. It's
wonderful for me to see everyone in the room today and also the many investors
that have joined us today via the virtual live stream. It's our third straight year of
having the annual meeting here in Austin.
At the ﬁrst meeting, the factory was still in the early stages of development with
equipment being installed and commissioned. During the 2022 meeting, production
had started to ramp as we produced about 1,600 vehicles that week. And now, less
than a year later, we have more than tripled the amount, having achieved production
of 5,000 cars in a single week. A huge congratulations to the Texas team. And on top
of that, we are getting ready to roll out our ﬁrst Cybertruck.
This exponential trajectory of the Gigafactory here in Texas is a reﬂection of Tesla as
a whole. In 2022, with another record-breaking year for us with deliveries growing by
40% year-over-year and that trend has continued in the ﬁrst quarter of 2023. We
would not be able to achieve this growth without the dedication of our amazing
employees. I've been fortunate enough over the years to actually travel to many of
our locations, all of the Gigafactories around the world. And I can tell you that I've
witnessed ﬁrsthand how our exceptional employees in our global talent across the
world has together achieved our mission or furthered our mission of accelerating the
world's transition to sustainable energy. A huge round of applause, please.
This year here in Texas, we also had our very ﬁrst Investor Day where we introduced
our company leaders from design to engineering to supply chain, manufacturing,
energy and charging. And they each spoke about the role of their teams in making
our mission come to life. And I was thrilled that investors were able to hear directly
from this outstanding leadership team that Elon has been able to put together over
many, many years. It is on the strength of their leadership and the hard work of our
dedicated employees around the world that I believe we'll not only weather the
macroeconomic environment that we've seen this year, but also continue to be in the
strongest position ever to advance Tesla's mission.
As a startup, Tesla proved that electric vehicles could be fun with the Roadster. They
could even be better than gas-powered vehicles in every single way with the S and X
and could be all of these things as well as aﬀordable with the Model 3 and Model Y,
which last quarter became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the
best selling non-pickup vehicle in the United States.
And today, as one of the world's largest global companies, we plan to change the
paradigm again by forging the path to achieving a global sustainable energyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16

As Tesla grows, so do our customers' positive impact on carbon emissions. When I
stood here last year I proudly announced that in 2021, our customers avoided
emitting 8.4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, the equivalent of over
20 billion miles driven by internal combustion engine vehicles. Today, I can tell you
that in 2022, our customers avoided releasing over 13.4 million metric tons of
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the equivalent of over 33 billion miles of
driving of internal combustion vehicles. That's an almost 60% increase in total
emission savings year-over-year.
Putting more of our products in customers' hands helps grow that number, and our
goals of making our products greener over time and further decarbonizing the
electric grid will help multiply that eﬀect.
As part of that goal, I am delighted to say that as described in our recent impact
report our global supercharging network was again 100% renewable in 2022. We've
been able to achieve all of this while maintaining, sorry, maintaining industry
margins, industry-leading margins, and generating strong cash ﬂows over the last
several years.
Going forward, we will continue our focus on capital investment plans to support our
future growth with investments in batteries, in vehicle production including the next
generation platform, in the building of our lithium reﬁnery that we recently broke
ground on, in the energy storage factories, in our sales and service footprint and in
our charging network among other things.
Before I hand it back to Martin, I would also like to thank Hiro Mizuno for his
dedicated service to the Tesla shareholders and the Board these past three years. I
would also like to express our enthusiasm on behalf of my fellow directors at the
prospect of JB Straubel joining our Board. I don't have to tell you that his passion for
Tesla and green tech will make him an important asset in our mission to accelerate
the world's transition to sustainable energy.
So again, on behalf of our full Board, thank you for your tremendous support, and
welcome to your 2023 shareholder meeting. And with that, I'll hand it back to Martin.
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you, Robyn. I will now call the meeting to order. Please refer to the meeting
agenda that has been provided to you and posted on the virtual meeting site.
The time is now 3.10 p.m. Central Time, and I declare the polls are now open. We
have already received over the last few weeks voting proxies from stockholders,
meaning that almost all the votes that will be counted were already submitted before
today. However, if you wish to vote your shares or change your prior vote, you mayFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 4 of 31Unidentiﬁed Speakerdo so through the virtual meeting site. For those who are in person here today,
ballots and ballot boxes were available to you at the check-in.
Tesla's Board of Directors has appointed Computershare Trust Company to serve as
Inspector of Elections. ComputerShare has taken and signed an oath as the
inspector and has certiﬁed that starting on April 6, 2023, the proxy materials or a
notice of internet availability of proxy materials were mailed or provided to all Tesla
stockholders of record on March 20, 2023.
We have majority of outstanding shares represented at the meeting, so I declare that
there is a quorum present at the meeting and we may proceed with the meeting.
The items on the agenda are as follows: Number one, the election of Class I
directors Elon Musk, Robyn Denholm and JB Straubel to serve for a term of three
years or until the respective successors are duly elected and qualiﬁed.
Number two, to approve executive compensation on a non-binding advisory basis.
Number three, to approve the frequency of future votes on executive compensation
on a non-binding advisory basis.
Number four, to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Tesla's
independent public registered accounting ﬁrm for the 2023 ﬁscal year.
Number ﬁve, to vote on a stockholder proposal included in our proxy statement,
which relates to the reporting of key person risk.
Number six, to vote on a stockholder proposal, which the stockholders did not seek
to have included in our proxy statement.
Tesla's Board has recommended that our stockholders vote for each of the director
nominees, for the approval by non-binding advisory vote of executive
compensation, and the ratiﬁcation of appointment of PwC as an independent
registered public accounting ﬁrm for ﬁscal year 2023. And every three years, for non-
binding advisory vote for the frequency of future votes on executive compensation.
With respect to stockholder proposal included in our proxy statement, which relates
to the reporting on the key men risk, Karen Robertsdottir on behalf of Sumtris is here
to present this proposal. Ms.Robertsdottir, can you please identify yourself? I would
like to invite you to speak. You will have three minutes.
Hello, thank you for having me here today. Under discussion is a shareholder
proposal concerning key person risk at Tesla requiring Tesla's board to draft a report
covering the steps taken to ameliorate the potential impacts of loss of key persons in
the company.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 5 of 31Martin ViechaHowever, before I begin, I would ﬁrst like to say thank you to Mr.Musk. For so many
of us, you stepped into ﬁelds where we had so desperately wanted to see change.
And through bringing in a talented team, willing to put in the long hours, you
dragged reluctant industries kicking and screaming into a better future. And for that,
thank you. Building up this juggernaut around us, which, as you largely put it, runs
itself these days. Thank you for that.
And yet, now here we are today, at a time when Tesla's technological leadership
should be on display. The investment community largely sees us as adrift, with
management focused on all the matters, not Tesla, watching as Tesla's brand
favorability dropped by 15 points last year, something that costs us margins. We have
such a spectacular product pipeline and a team that knows how to execute at scale
with low cost of goods sold, something that we are not being properly recognized
for.
It should go without saying but apparently bears repeating that, if you cannot
produce with low COGS, you have no future. When I look around the auto industry
these days, I see a lot of companies that have no future. And that's a success on
behalf of an incredible team here at Tesla that deserves recognition.
When people look at this company, that's not what they see. They see the company
as a synonym for its CEO. And then the discussion turns to everything except for
where it should be focused. It's my sincere hope that by introducing this proposal,
we can not only accelerate the development of management at Tesla, but also
increase its visibility. The fact that this company is so much more than its key persons
is something that the public and the investment community should see.
A founder often ﬁnds their greatest success in ensuring the future of the company
and the development of the management talent who can come after them. Think
Tim Cook at Apple, Steve Ballmer at Microsoft, and so forth. People who are ready
from day one to execute without controversy, without distraction and build a future
for the company.
I encourage the Board should embrace this opportunity in the most public manner
possible to showcase the future being built right here so that the discussion among
the public and the investment community revolves around that and not around every
public statement on every other topic made by the leadership.
I strongly encourage the board, the shareholders to support this proposal and for
the Board to embrace it. Thank you very much.
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you Ms.Robertsdottir. The Board has recommended that our stockholders
vote against this proposal for the reasons as set forth in our statement of opposition
in our proxy statement.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 6 of 31Unidentiﬁed SpeakerFinally, as you saw and investor advocates for social justice would like to raise a
proposal from the ﬂoor. The proponents did not seek to have their proposal
included in the proxy statement. The Board recommends that our stockholders who
are entitled to vote on this proposal vote against it.
As a reminder, as is disclosed in the proxy statement, I have been advised by the
proxy holders that they intend to vote all shares of stock over which they have
discretionary authority against this proposal. Only shareholders who are
shareholders of record or have obtained a legal proxy may vote for this proposal
after it is presented.
Courtney Wicks, representing Investor Advocates for Social Justice, is here to
present the proposal. Ms.Wicks, I would like you to speak. You will have three
minutes.
Thank you. Good afternoon, Tesla Board members, management, employees, and
shareholders. My name is Courtney Wicks, and I am the Executive Director for
Investor Advocates for Social Justice, and I am here on behalf of As You Sow and the
Sisters of the Good Shepherd, who have ﬁled shareholder proposals in the past on
child labor and human rights abuses in Tesla's supply chain.
I stand here today to call on shareholders to vote yes on requesting Tesla to conduct
a third-party report detailing the company's eﬀorts to eradicate child-enforced labor
in its supply chain. The human rights risks that permeate throughout Tesla's value
chain when not adequately addressed harm shareholder value and undermine
Tesla's ability to lead the just transition.
Growing attention and concern have been placed on child labor in cobalt mining in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as on forced labor in China's Xinjiang
region. 70% of the world's cobalt needed for EV batteries are sourced in the DRC,
over 40,000 children work in artisanal and small-scale mining, often without
protective equipment and in dangerous spaces that frequently collapse. Many
children are seriously injured or killed in the mining process.
In Tesla's latest sustainability report, it claims to have audited 80% of the miners and
reﬁners in their cobalt supply chain against responsible production standards.
However, there are many industry-backed standards, some of which are weak, and it
isn't clear what percentage of audits were conducted by which initiatives.
It is also unclear how the company's due diligence ensures cobalt source from child
labor is not intermingled in the industrial cobalt supply chain. Subsequently, an
estimated 1.8 million people have been subject to state-imposed genocide,
detention and internment camps, and forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur region. A
recent study concluded that automakers cannot conduct meaningful audits in this
region. The recent Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in the United States Senate
inquiry into Tesla's supply chain highlights the regulatory risk Tesla faces.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16

Page 7 of 31Martin Viecha
Elon R. MuskWe believe a third-party audit would provide greater transparency into how Tesla
plans to eradicate child-enforced labor from its supply chain. One of Tesla's
competitive advantages is its sustainable leadership. Tesla, its Board of Directors,
and management team have a moral obligation to pursue ethical sourcing practices
that do not rely on the lives of children or enslaved people. Tesla can continue to
make a true leadership diﬀerence that forges a sustainable economic future that is
anchored by innovation, empathy, human development, and shareholder value.
Thank you.
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you, Ms.Wicks. We will now accept votes for, against, or to abstain for this
proposal, but again, only for record holders or legal proxyholders. Please note, this is
the ﬁnal opportunity to submit proxies in order for them to be counted.
I declare the polls are now closed. Based on proxies we have previously received, I'd
like to announce on preliminary basis that our stockholders have approved the
recommendations of the Tesla Board on all agenda items except that shareholders
have recommended one year for non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of
future votes on executive compensation. This means that I would like to oﬃcially
announce our new addition to the Tesla Board, JB Straubel.
After the ﬁnal tabulation is completed, we will announce speciﬁc vote tallies in the
ﬁling Form 8-K within four business days of this meeting. That concludes the oﬃcial
business of today's shareholder meeting, which is now adjourned.
During the course of the following session, we may discuss our business outlook and
make forward-looking statements. Such statements are predictions based on current
expectations. Actual events could diﬀer materially due to a number of risks and
uncertainties, including those disclosed in our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q
ﬁlings with the SEC. Such forward-looking statements represent our views as of
today, should not be relied on thereafter, and we disclaim from any obligation to
update them after today. And with that, please welcome Elon Musk.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I just want to say I love you guys. Well, we've got a lot of great news to talk about
today. The Tesla team has done an incredible job of executing over the past year,
and we have many exciting years ahead of us. So, yes.
So with the Tesla Master Plan Part 3, which admittedly was quite technical, we wanted
to go into a lot of technical depth so it was clear that what we were saying was not
just -- were not merely assertions, but that they were backed up with physics and
with real data, that it's realistic. And with the Master Plan Part 3, we want to basically,
the goal is to give people hope, realistic hope. And maybe hope is even the wrong
word, but simply to say that there is a path to a fully sustainable global economy, that
we are on that path, that we are accelerating that path. And that so long as we don't
get complacent about it, it will happen.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 8 of 31So I'll just kind of rush through a recap of the Master Plan Part 3. But some of the
salient points are that it will actually take less energy to go sustainable, not more
energy. It's actually -- some of these things may sound very obvious, but it's more
energy eﬃcient to go sustainable, not less.
And there's less mining that is required for a sustainable energy economy, not more.
Also, very important. And I heard a question raised about cobalt mining. And you
know what? We will do a third-party audit. In fact, we'll put a webcam on the mine. If
anybody sees any children, please let us know.
I don't want to go oﬀ on a tangent too much on that front, but it's very important to
appreciate that most of our battery packs are iron-based, a majority of our battery
packs are iron-based, not cobalt. And our other battery packs are nickel-based, not
cobalt. The nickel batteries use a little bit of cobalt as a binder, but only a tiny
amount. In contrast, your phones all use 100% cobalt. I recommend complaining to
the phone manufacturers. But even for the small amount of cobalt that we do use,
we will make sure six weeks to Sunday that no child labor is being exploited.
Obviously, we are a company that cares a lot about doing the right thing, and we
don't want to delude ourselves or delude anyone else. So, yes.
So, again, just recapping Master Plan Part 3. It's really the point is to say that it is very
doable. It is happening. We need a three-fold increase in solar and wind. We need to
really something like a 29-fold increase in vehicle station and thermal battery
production. Actually, in a nutshell, the way to think about sustainability is the faster
we can make battery packs, the faster we can move to a sustainable energy
economy. That's the fundamental limiting factor. So let's grab some water here.
So, yes, I can't emphasize that point enough. The rate of lithium-ion battery
production fundamentally decides the rate at which the world transitions to
sustainability because the batteries are needed for all forms of transport and for
stationary storage given the intimate nature of solar and wind power.
So -- and we do invite people to critique our analysis because any given analysis is
going to be, to some degree, wrong. So we -- that's why we put it out there, looking
for critical feedback to say, well, perhaps we've got some things wrong, perhaps
some things need to be adjusted. But generally, the feedback we've gotten is that
actually our analysis is quite accurate and we've not seen any rebuttals thus far that
would cause us to change our assumptions.
So it means roughly 240 terawatt hours of battery pack or 240,000-gigawatt hours of
battery need to be produced, but it'll only take 0.2% of land area for solar and wind.
So it's a very -- it's not like we need to carpet the earth with solar and wind, it's just
literally a fraction of a percent. Roughly a $10 trillion manufacturing investment,
which relative to the global economy, is actually a small number. Roughly 10% of the
world economy. I think -- obviously, I think 10% of the world economy is a small price
to pay for a sustainable energy future.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 9 of 31It's also true that even when factoring in the cost or the emissions required to
produce an electric vehicle, which, for now, are a little higher than gasoline vehicles,
when you look at the emissions over time, electric vehicles absolutely win by a long
shot. And as we're seeing the cost and the emissions required to produce an electric
vehicle are dropping rapidly over time. And we're going to get to the point where
we're going to get to the point where we're going to be going to get to the point
where an electric vehicle is cheaper than a gasoline vehicle.
So, in 2022, we avoided releasing about 13 million tons of CO2, reduced
manufacturing GHG per vehicle by 30%, and reduced water usage by 15% despite
massive increases in output. We also made our factories safer, which is really
important. So we track the injuries per person, and we believe at this point we are
best in industry and have the lowest injuries per person.
We're now actually quite a big company from a headcount standpoint. This is our
direct employment number. So this does not count contractors. And for every
manufacturing job, depending on how you count it, there are at least 5, sometimes
up to 10 jobs created, because you've got to look at the total supply chain as well as
all of the support functions.
So when you create a factory like this, you actually create jobs for teachers, lawyers,
carpenters, electricians, and restaurants, and everything that's required to support a
person at a factory. And this is why countries and states are so interested in having
manufacturing facilities in their location. So anyway, it's a lot of people gainfully
employed doing very useful things.
We received 3.6 million job applications last year. So -- and once again, the top two
most desired companies for engineers on Earth were SpaceX and Tesla. At the end
of the day, the competitiveness of any given company is a function of what -- where
are the most talented people interested in working? That is the team that's going to
win. In fact, I'd say this is generally the case. If you look at any given company and
say, where are the smartest, most driven people going to work? That company is
going to win. So, whether it's Tesla or any other company.
We're also excited to announce our next-gen drive unit, which is a big reduction in
silicon carbide. It's half the factory space. Notably, there are zero rare earth elements
required. So, yes. And we're also changing to a 48-volt low-voltage architecture in
the car. So, this is a big deal, actually.
So, cars have been operating with 12-volt batteries for basically about a century. So,
for the ﬁrst time in, I think, over 100 years, we're actually going to change from a 12
voltage outside of the (inaudible) to a 48 volt architecture. And to ﬁrst
approximation, that means we need only about a quarter as much copper in the car
as would be needed for a 12-volt battery. So that's a big deal, because people are
often worried about, is there enough copper. Yes, there is.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 10 of 31And FSD Beta is growing hyper exponentially. So that chart is going to look like a
wall, basically. And just a question for those in the room. How many people have
tried out FSD Beta? So what do you think of the latest build? Right? So, it's really
getting to the point where it's, at least for me, when I drive around, it's several days
between interventions. And I think we're getting to the point where there's really just
one last piece of the system that needs to be a neural net, which is the planning and
control function. And so, we expect to have that last piece become neural net. So it'll
be end-to-end from video in to control out as a neural net.
And so the thing to appreciate is it's not that full self-driving will be as good as a
person. It will be much, much better, like a lot, like over time, 10x safer than a person.
So it's not even going to be a contest, frankly. So this is a really big deal. And I think
some people realize it. I think you guys probably realize it. But being able to do a
software update and have several million cars suddenly go from manual driving to
autonomous, I think will be the single biggest asset value increase in history.
The normal usage of a passenger car is roughly 10 to 12 hours per week, maybe an
hour and a half per day. And when you drive around, you see lots of cars just parked
in parking lots because out of the 168 hours in a week, they're using less than 10%,
maybe 7% of the hours per week, a car is in use. But once it is autonomous, it can be
used probably, I don't know, 50 hours a week, maybe more.
So it is eﬀectively a ﬁve-fold increase in the value of a car overnight. I'm actually
surprised that so few people realize this, or maybe they just don't believe it's real.
But it is. So this is really an insanely big deal.
We're also the largest EV maker in the world. So, yes. And I think that will continue.
And while at the same time being the highest margin of any car maker in the world.
Now making electric vehicles proﬁtably is hard, as illustrated by the diﬃculty of our
competitors. A number of our competitors are making EVs at a signiﬁcant loss. But
we are not. We are actually making EVs proﬁtably and almost no one else is. This is
hard.
And I'd say for this, it's a massive credit to the Tesla team for, I can't tell you how hard
manufacturing is. You've probably heard me say that prototypes are easy,
manufacturing is hard. And then manufacturing at scale with positive cash ﬂow is
excruciating. This is mega pain. But the Tesla team has done it. And as you can see,
our free cash ﬂow per year has been increasing steadily. So we're making good
progress.
It should be said that, and I've made some of these comments, that interest rates
may have -- have a very big eﬀect on the aﬀordability of cars. So the vast majority of
people buy cars based on the monthly payment. So it's like how much is monthly
payment? And it's not a question of value for money. It's just do they actually have
enough money, can they aﬀord it?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 11 of 31So, for the vast majority of people, people just can they aﬀord to pay the payment.
As the interest rates increase and credit tightens, I can safely say that these various
banks that have died are probably somewhat distracted from handing out auto
loans. It's like if they're on their way to the cemetery, increasing their auto loan
portfolio is not the ﬁrst thing on their mind.
So this is going to be a challenging 12 months. I want to be sort of realistic about it.
Tesla is not immune to the global economic environment. I expect things to be just
at a macroeconomic level diﬃcult for at least the next 12 months. Tesla will get
through it and will do well, and I think we'll see a lot of companies actually go
bankrupt.
So I want to make sure that this is not just the good news parade. It's important to
understand that no company is immune to the macroeconomic environment. But
that said, it won't be darkness forever. I expect probably a year of diﬃculty globally
for everyone. And then my best guess is that the global economy turns around in
roughly 12 months. And then Tesla will be in an extremely good position. So anyone
who is a long-term investor, I think, will do extremely well.
And I give a big shoutout to the Tesla internal software team. This is -- it's actually a
really big deal that Tesla has such a powerful internal software team. I mean, that
software team is responsible for handling the entire customer experience from
buying the car, delivering the car, operating the factories, service, and support. We
internally wrote all of the insurance and ﬁnancial software, the supply chain and
logistics stuﬀ, the data centers and infrastructure, and the analytics and insight. This
is all internally written Tesla software. I think there's almost no companies in the
world that can do this because they do not have a very talented internal software
team. So they're generally reliant on third-party enterprise resource planning
software, but Tesla is not. This is a hidden strength of the company that often doesn't
get a lot of attention but is incredibly powerful. So once again, I'd like to thank them
for their work.
And as predicted, we are highly conﬁdent that Model Y will be the number one best-
selling car on earth this year. And in fact, in Europe, the best-selling car of any kind,
yeah, whatsoever. It already was that in Q1, I should say. It's not like will be. It was that
in Q1. And China, the best-selling SUV. And the United States, the best-selling non-
pickup vehicle in the United States in Q1.
So, it's going well. I don't know if this is like the optimal picture, but the Tesla cars are
actually the safest cars in the world. We put immense eﬀort into vehicle safety, and
we keep updating the safety. So we keep improving the automatic emergency
braking system just with a software update. And we keep improving the airbag
deployment with software updates.
So we close the feedback loop on, like, when we see an accident, we analyze the
accident and we say, what can we do from a software standpoint, because there's
actually quite a lot you can do, to ﬁrst of all avoid the accident because the bestFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 12 of 31accident is no accident. And then if the accident occurs, how do we deploy the
airbags and the seatbelt pre-tensioners to minimize the probability of injury.
And so -- even for cars that people have owned for many years, we are behind the
scenes, continuously improving the safety of your car. And there are even some
things that I think a lot of people aren't aware of that we actually have automatic
cabin overheat protection. So, never in the history of the company has a child or a
pet died in a Tesla. So, it's one of those little-known features, but because we have a
large battery and we're monitoring things all the time, we can make sure that the
cabin temperature never gets to lethal levels. And I think that's a big deal. So.
And then while lots of cars will say they've got like ﬁve stars or whatever, there's
nuance to that. When we did the European NCAP sort of active safety tests, we got
the highest scores that they've ever seen. So yeah. So we got a 98% score on the
active safety system, which obviously isn't good enough. And we will, we have got a
game plan for getting rid of the last 2%. And then it's worth noting things like the
total cost of ownership of a Model 3 is now comparable to that of a Toyota Corolla.
Superchargers, we're making good progress. So our Supercharger uptime is now
99.95%. So, yeah. And we have Superchargers practically everywhere at this point.
Going to Megapack, because this is stationary storage is an important part of solving
the sustainable energy problem. And the Tesla Megapack is now more competitive
than a natural gas peaker plant. So we have very strong demand for the Tesla
Megapack. And we're going to make a lot of them.
So, yeah. And a while back I predicted that the Tesla stationary battery pack business
would actually grow faster than the automotive side of things, and that's exactly what
has happened. You can see it's an exponential curve growing at a rate that is even
faster than our vehicle sales. We're expanding Gigafactory Nevada for the Tesla Semi
Production Line and for the 4680 in-house cell production. And yeah, some
Megafactory stuﬀ. We're aiming for 40-gigawatt hours a year, both in California and
in China, but I think long-term this will be much, much greater than this. I mean, I
wouldn't be surprised if long-term -- the stationary battery pack activity went well in
excess of 500-gigawatt hours per year. So the demand is like quasi-inﬁnite here.
As we look ahead to tackle what we see as the choke points in the supply chain, one
of them is lithium reﬁning. And I think there have been a few times on Tesla earnings
calls where I've said, can someone please just do lithium reﬁning because there's
just a shortage of it. And -- but we really see very little activity outside of China for
lithium reﬁning. So, it's not that we wish to take on extra problems, but since nobody
else was doing it, we felt we had to do this. And so, we've just broken ground on a
lithium reﬁnery in Corpus Christi, which will be -- do more lithium reﬁning than I think
probably everything outside of China.
So -- and we've signed a deal for our next Gigafactory in Mexico, GigaMexico. I think
that's going to be a fantastic factory. So we're laying the groundwork for ultimatelyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16

Page 13 of 31getting to 20 million vehicles a year. So Cybertruck is a hard car to make. Because it's
such a radically new design. It actually, you can't just use conventional methods of
manufacturing. We had to invent a whole new set of manufacturing techniques in
order to build an exoskeleton-based car instead of an endoskeleton-based car.
So it's extremely non-trivial to build a Cybertruck. But we're making good progress
on that. We have the, so yes, that's the thing I, when I, in the factory, I tour the
Cybertruck line to see how we're doing there and sorry for the delay, but we're
ﬁnally going to start delivering production Cybertrucks later this year. And I think the
product if anything, is better than expectations. Cybertruck is the car I will be driving
on a day-to-day basis.
People always want to know what our next product is. But this is not the time to -- we
obviously need to have a proper, dedicated product launch. I just want to emphasize
that we are actually building a new product. We are actually designing a new
product. We're not sitting on our hands here. So there are two new products that I
think you will be very excited about. And both the design of the products and the
manufacturing techniques are head and shoulders above anything else that is
present in industry. So, yeah, anyways.
If I were to guess, I would say of these two new products, just these two new
products alone, I would say there's, we will probably make, this is just Elon's guess.
So, don't sue me. But Elon's guess is that we'll probably make in excess of 5 million
units a year of these two models combined.
I think, the thing most notable is if you look at the diﬀerence between the last time
we showed Optimus and this is a video that was taken basically yesterday and the
Optimus team was up all night making this video. The Optimus team has done an
incredible job. And it's the motors, the controllers, the electronics, and everything
you see in the Optimus robot is a Tesla designed system. So this is -- we actually
tried to ﬁnd actuators and what not that were oﬀ the shelf. We found that there
weren't any.
In order to make an eﬀective humanoid robot, you actually have to design the
motors and gear boxes and the electronics from scratch because it's a very diﬀerent
application from anything else that exists. So we took our world class motor and
power electronics team and said, okay, we need to design several actuators that
don't exist in the world. And they did.
So Optimus is working quite well. And then for full self-driving -- as full self-driving
gets closer and closer to generalized real world AI, that same software is transferable
to a humanoid robot.
Just like, humans can obviously walk around with their arms and legs, but we can
drive a car, ﬂy a plane, steer a boat, ride a horse. If you have a generalized
understanding, if you have generalized real world AI, which is what we areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16

Q - Analystdeveloping for full self-driving, it can be transferred to basically anything. And so
Optimus will use the same FSD computer as the car.
And the Optimus stuﬀ is, I think, somewhat extremely underrated, because people
just cannot comprehend the consequences. Now obviously we need to make sure
that we don't have a Terminator scenario. That's very important. It's all fun and games
until Terminator shows up. But if you say like -- if you had a generalized humanoid
robot, what would be the eﬀective ratio of humanoid robots to humans?
Because I think basically everyone would want one. And maybe people would want
more than one. Which means the actual demand for something like Optimus, if it
really works, which it will, is, I don't know, 10 billion units? It's some crazy number. It
might be 20 billion units if the ratio is say 2 to 1 on people -- humanoid robots versus
people, it might actually be, it's some very big number is what I'm saying. And a
number vastly in excess of the number of cars. So my prediction is that Tesla's long-
term value will be -- a majority of long-term value will be Optimus. And that
prediction I'm very conﬁdent of. So, alright.
Let's see, so I think with that we can do questions perhaps? We also want to make

Hey kid.
Do you see it more likely that you guys will have an RV ﬁrst or a cyber camper?

Well, we don't have any plans to build an RV quite yet, although I can certainly see
how a Cybertruck, could be converted into an RV. And we are adding a lot of sort of
attach points to Cybertrucks, so others can build things. Somebody can have a
startup or other companies can build things that are attachments that enhance a
Cybertruck and turn it into a camper essentially. So I think it would be really cool to
have all these third-party things available for Cybertruck.

{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I'm pretty conﬁdent we have the funnest shareholders meeting by a long shot.
Undoubtedly. Yeah. It's amazing. So I'm really excited about a lot of things with Tesla.
It's hard to pick a good question that's going to cover everything. But with the
energy side of the business, I think it's hugely underrated. I mean, we've got tons of
problems, I mean, California with rolling blackout. How do you think you can
incentivize people more for solar, battery backup, and we've got the referral
program that's been beefed up as well. So what are your thoughts there that we can
get people on board?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. Actually, one of the challenges in California and a few other few other places is
that in order to have the Powerwall be like an uninterruptible power supply for the
house, we have to actually have a switch that disconnects you from the utility.
Otherwise, you just send energy into the grid and it doesn't do anything. And that's
actually been quite diﬃcult with utilities, but I'd like to thank PG&E for recently
helping us get approval for installing the backup switch for Powerwall in California so
that people can have uninterrupted power in California. And we're working on that
in every jurisdiction. So I'm conﬁdent that that's going to be a great long-term
situation.
And then as I mentioned, Megapack is growing very rapidly. And -- yeah, so things
are -- I mean things are really growing ridiculously fast on the energy storage front.
So yeah, I feel good about that situation. All right, next question.
Great. Elon, a lot of people have just kind of been wondering, how are you doing?
So I was wondering, what's up? How you doing? How you feeling? We saw you were

like, it's not exactly super fun.
But there was a short-term distraction because I had to do, like, some major open
heart surgery on Twitter to ensure the company's survival. But that, I think Twitter is
now in a stable place. And I'm obviously very excited to have Linda Yaccarino join.
And so I think Linda is going to do a great job running Twitter.
And I'll provide, obviously, guidance on technology development. But as you can
see, I think Twitter at this point has released more new features in the last six months
than it has in the last six years. So, obviously, this is not a Twitter meeting, but the
larger point is that I feel at this point, I don't need to devote incremental time. The
amount of time that Twitter will take going forward is relatively small compared to
the last six months, so yes.
Apart from like, there's like some macroeconomic things that we can't do anything
about. Overall, I feel very good about the health of the companies and I'm
increasingly optimistic about the future. Thanks for asking. It's kind of you to ask.
Have you guys considered stretching out the ﬁnancing terms on your auto business?
You talked about earlier, consumers don't necessarily look at the sticker price they're
paying. All they're concerned about is monthly payment.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Right.
And one of the fundamental advantages of an eBay is that it's substantially more
durable. And so, would you guys ever consider stretching terms out to 10 years,
especially in this rate environment, given the shape of the yield curve, extending the
terms out that far, you'd actually be capturing lower cost of funds.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, the important thing to appreciate is that, like, that the vast majority of
the ﬁnancing is from banks. So it's kind of whatever the banks are prepared to do. I
mean, this year, I guess we'll do on the order of $100 billion of sales. And we don't
have $100 billion in cash to ﬁnance that. So the vast majority has got to come from
banks.
So it's really the bank's choice of what they're willing to do. And it's -- it has been
tricky with banks recently because, as I mentioned earlier, if you're a bank and you're
not sure whether you're going to be alive or not, it's a pretty big distraction and
increasing your auto loan portfolio is very much a secondary priority. So it's just
important to appreciate, it's not up to Tesla, it's up to the banks. And there's not

A - Kevin Mukaicetera, because you have to securitize those loans. And the market for securitizing
them is weak.
There is no, I wish there was an easy path, but there isn't. So I think, it's important to
remember that the economy moves in cycles. And we've had a very long period of
upcycle. The next 12 months will be, I think, diﬃcult for everyone. And I think, when
Berkshire Hathaway had their annual meeting, Warren and Charlie actually said like,
hey, this year the Berkshire companies are going to make less money. And so,
they're very well run organizations. And I think that's just generally true for the
economy. So -- but it's also important to remember that, there are good times and
there are dark times, but then the good times follow the dark times.
So my advice would be don't look at the markets for the next 12 months. If there's a
dip, buy the dip. And I think you will not be sorry because, there's just generally a
sort of a -- there's an economic cycle to things, but things come back up. So my
guess is tough times for a year, like I said, just my guess. But then Tesla will emerge
stronger than ever the long-term, if you say like net present value of future cash ﬂows
will be incredible in my opinion. All right.

{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
That's like seven years ago at this point.
Yeah. That's what I'm saying.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. It's actually -- I talk to a lot of people and they still think that Tesla's are like
super expensive. I'm like, no actually, the starting price for Tesla is below the average
auto price in the U.S. that's like -- and that's a good thing. I mean, I think it's good
that it's that way. Our goal was always to make cars that are aﬀordable to the general
public.
So, I hear you. I mean, I think -- and it's indeed ironic that Twitter is highly dependent
on advertising. So here I am, it's like, never used advertising really before, and now I
have a company that's highly dependent on advertising. So I guess I should say
advertising is awesome and everyone should do it.
But I think I share your sort of larger point which is that, there are amazing features
and functionality about Tesla's that people just don't know about. And although
there's obviously a lot of people that follow the Tesla account and my account on
Twitter, to some degree it is preaching to the acquirer. And the acquirer is already
convinced.
So I think what you're saying does have some merits and you know what, I believe in
taking suggestions. So we'll try a little advertising and see how it goes. Okay, okay. I
wasn't expecting that level of enthusiasm. But okay, it sounds like a shareholders -- if
I read between the lines subtle as it is I'll say which probably is an advertizing. Okay,
very well. All right.
Hi Elon. Hi Tesla, thank you for everything. So my question is regarding you recently
add Steam to the car and that's the way we can play video games. Is Tesla like
currently developing the ability for other parties to develop apps for the car, for
example, if we come by actually customizable teams for the operator receives in -- of
the car. I think you can make some revenue there, that space teams for the car or
Lord of the Rings or stuﬀ like that. Do you have any have any interest in that right
now?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well. So I think the notion of having entertainment apps and whatnot becomes
increasingly important as the cars achieve self-driving, because otherwise, you canFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 20 of 31Q - Analyst
A - Elon R. Muskonly really watch play games or watch movies or whatever when the car is stationary.
If it's charging or whatever, then you can use it. But at the point at which it's Full Self-
Driving, I think it's very much about entertainment and productivity.
So I think that is something that might make sense in the future. But overwhelmingly,
the focus right now for Tesla software apart from improving safety is achieving Full
Self-Driving. And then getting Full Self-Driving to be much safer than human driving.
And then once we achieve Full Self-Driving, I think that there could be a lot of
opportunity for apps and whatnot.
So even in the car as it is today, for a model S and X, we've made a sort of a full
Steam integration. So you can actually just literally logon with a model S or X with
your Steam accounts and play any game that is on Steam, which is a lot of games,
which is pretty wild. I think a lot of people don't know that.
You can play with a keyboard or mouse. You can play with a joystick or controller. You
can also play Netﬂix, YouTube, or anything else. I mean, for my little son X, he loves
watching, actually loves watching Rocket videos in the rear screen of the model S
and X. So yes, it is something that we will do long-term. But one of the things, we
already have a lot of stuﬀ there and we'll do more as self-driving becomes a reality.
Hey, Elon. I'm John or Dr.Know-it-all on YouTube and I don't know it all. But anyway,
my question is, as you guys move completely or ﬁnish the transition in Full Self-
Driving from version 1.0 of the software to 2.0, what do you perceive of as the like
potential stumbling blocks after that? Because it seems like that's the major kind of
step change that needed to happen. And so you're almost done with that. And what
happens after that? And also, please let me interview you about Full Self-Driving, like
I'll spend two hours talking about just that. Thank you.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, there's -- we can really think about Full Self-Driving as sort of a march of nines
of reliability. So we need to get to the point where the probability of injury is lower
than that of the average human driver, and then ultimately, probability of injury is
much lower. So even at the point at which the car is capable of driving itself, there's
still a lot of work to do.
Every year, there's 1 million people that die in auto accidents, and I think probably
everyone in this audience has friends and family that have died or been seriously
injured in auto accidents. And for every -- there's like million people that died,
there's 10 million people roughly that are seriously, like permanently injured. And so
it matters that we -- if we can get that down by an order of magnitude, there's like
900,000 lives saved per year, maybe 9 million severe injuries prevented per year.
And so that really, I think, morally has to be our primary goal. And I guess, I'm open
to an interview on FSD. Two hours is a long time, but -- okay, okay. Alright, I'll do an
interview. It's got to be on Twitter, but sure. All right.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16

Q - AnalystHi, Elon. I'm Josh Phillips, long-time Retail Investor. My question is about battery-
grade lithium supply in the next 10 years. Lithium experts all agree that mines are just
not coming online fast enough to meet battery supply. And actually, Drew Baglino
pointed this out recently. Some mines take 10 years plus to be permitted. And even
GM has actually announced, like, huge lithium deals that will, like, secure away
supply from the rest of the industry. So what's Tesla's plans to get more supply of
lithium at the mine level, outside of reﬁning, but also at a deeper level than a
traditional oﬀtake, because as we know, he who controls this device, controls the
universe.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. So I actually think that the industry analysis is incorrect, and the constraint is
fundamentally that of processing. So our reﬁnery in Corpus Christi that we're
building is primarily oriented towards reﬁning spodumene, of which there is a truly
vast amount in the world. I think, about three quarters of our lithium comes from
Australia.
And frankly, you could increase the rate at which the mines are operating, and the
limiting factor is not how fast can you mine, but how fast can you process. So the
mines are only going to produce ore at the rate at which reﬁneries can handle the
ore or it's pointless. So I think my opinion, and obviously I could be wrong about this,
but it's really not about the lithium ore. Lithium is extremely common. Lithium is
everywhere. In every country, it's got lithium. It's not like oil.
So lithium is one of the most common elements on earth. But we're taking the
lithium ore and reﬁning it to battery grade is extremely diﬃcult, because the purity
levels required for a battery are extremely high. If you have even a small impurity,
then you will degrade the life of the cell dramatically. So you need ultra-pure battery-
grade lithium, and that's why our focus is on reﬁning as opposed to mining. Thank
you.
Hi, Elon. Thanks. It's a great time here. You spoke about safety in your presentation of
the vehicles. And I just want to say, I'm thankful to you for building such a safe

Totally fair and reasonable question. Where is that thing? So we expect to complete
the engineering and design of the next-gen Tesla Roadster this year, and hopefully
start production. This is not a commitment, but hopefully start production next year.
So it is like, as you alluded to, it's not even the icing on the cake, it's the cherry on the

be sick. And there's some value to me running two companies because the next-gen

I think really there should be one national standard for insurance, especially car
insurance. I think it would improve the cost eﬀectiveness of car insurance. But our

Okay. You mean Self-driving.
FSD, what's going to be the top automobile margin?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, what I was saying earlier is that at the point at which you have a truly
autonomous vehicle that can drive around with no one in it, the utility of the vehicle, I
think, as a rough guess, is probably 5x what it is today, because people will drive an
average of hour and a half a day, perhaps, so 10 hours a week. But if the car is
autonomous, it can probably -- this is just speculation, but it probably can operate for
1/3 of the hours in the week, which would mean 50 or more hours, thus a ﬁvefold
increase. But the car costs the same.
Sure, I understand. But what is going to be the margin for Tesla then? Because you're
obviously thinking you're going to sell much more FSD then, right? You may have a
system in place of robotaxis you may have a cut with ﬂeets. So did you do any
projections what the automotive peak margin for Tesla could be in two years, ﬁve
years, and the same for energy?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16

Well, I mean, this is deﬁnitely -- we're in sort of highly speculative territory here. But
obviously, if you've got a car that costs the same and has, say, I don't know, a 20% or
25% margin, and suddenly is able to be used 5x as much, then you might have 80%
margins, and the revenue would increase several fold. That's why I say it's probably
going to be the biggest asset value step change in history of Earth. And energy does
not have -- energy just simply does not have such an increase in asset utilization. So I
would expect energy to be to remain at sort of 20%, 25%-ish to 30% margin.
All right. So you said ask the tough questions. You're still good, right?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah.
All right. Cool. First of all, though, as a family man, I just want to say there's a couple
of things like a loop or tether of a car seat going through the headrest, which would
be super helpful. There's a couple other things that would be really nice, model wise,
the only one you can do that in today, maybe we could ﬁx that. But when we're
thinking about 4680 battery cells, should we be thinking about the eﬃciency and the
performance we're getting today? Or is there some updated timeline path that we
could see closer to battery day presented eﬃciency performance that we can look to
in the future?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, I think ﬁrst of all it's really important to express the diﬃculty of, like, for Tesla to
go from nothing to making a battery cell that we aspire to be better than any other
battery cell on Earth, even when compared to companies where the only thing they
do is make a battery cell, is obviously not a trivial exercise. That said, we do see a
path to very high energy density and higher energy density and lower costs than
anything else out there.
But it's a hard path. It's a very hard path. And normally it would be absurd for
companies to attempt such a thing. And no other car company is really attempting to
do anything like this in a serious way. So I guess technically BYD, because they
started out as a battery company, yes, so it's a very diﬃcult thing to do. But I think we
are tracking to success in that regard.
Hey, Elon, ﬁrst of all, thank you for undoubtedly making the world a better place for
my son to live in.

Once Cybertruck is fully ramped in Austin, what is the target production? And also,
there's some rumors that you're thinking about stepping down as CEO. Please say it
ain't so.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It ain't so. Yes, so I think Tesla's going to play an important role in AI and AGI. And I
think I need to oversee that to make sure it's good. So -- because that's a thorny
problem if there ever was one. I think generally people do not, or very few people,
even in the AI community, do not appreciate just how much capability Tesla has in AI.
It's by far the most advanced real-world AI. There's no one even close. And reality
has the most degrees of freedom. So I got to make sure that's good. And you were
saying something?
Cybertruck fully ramps.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. So as I said, we'll start production later this year. We'll start handing over cars
later this year. There will be an S-curve of production, so it will be slow at ﬁrst and
then ramping up. And I guess, we'll see what the demand is like. So I mean, I think,
we're likely to do probably 0.25 million a year, I think, maybe more. Again, very much
dependent on what the demand is like. And we don't just need to ramp up
production, but we also need to improve the production cost eﬃciency, which is
going to be also a very hard thing.
So -- but I'd say 0.25 million a year is a reasonable guess. And it might be 500,000. I
don't know, but we'll make as many as people want and can aﬀord. And then like as I
said, it's going to be hard to make the cost aﬀordable because it is a new car, new
manufacturing method. So in the grand scheme of things, relative to the production
rate of all the other cars we make, it will be small. But it's still very cool. Yeah. Thanks.
You can take maybe three more questions?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure.
Thank you. Good day, Mr.Musk. Hello. My name is Delia Archer, and this question
aims to address Tesla's eﬀorts in developing skilled workforce, attracting diverse
talent, and promoting career opportunities within the company. When I look around,
I see a lot of young faces, and I think about internships and apprenticeships forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16

Q - Analyststudents in high school and beyond. My question is, are there any plans to expand
existing partnerships and explore new avenues for collaborations with educational
institutions and non-proﬁt organizations to attract the next generation and vary
career pathways?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, actually, with all of our Gigafactories, we work with the local schools, actually
from the high school level, community college, and university, because it's incredibly
important to foster the talent for the factories.
As you saw from the employment numbers, we actually need a lot of people. Even
though we've got a lot of automation. We still need a lot of people to operate the
factories. And it really matters that they have the right training. So we're big believers
in reaching out to educational institutions, and -- because frankly, it's in our interest
to do so. So thank you for asking the question.
Elon, Josh Fuller. I had originally thought of asking about the fun police and pushing
back on the boom box and allowing us to screech at people with goats again. But
after seeing Optimus, I was inspired to ask, has anybody asked Optimus' opinion of
Mars? Does he have a ticket yet?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, Optimus is not a deep thinker at this point. So Optimus is still ﬁguring out how
to do basic stuﬀ. Like it couldn't make -- cook some eggs or something quite yet. So
we need to get Optimus to the point where it has reasonable agility and can do
basic things. And we're aiming for it to start oﬀ doing simple tasks that are sort of
boring and repetitive or dangerous, basically jobs people don't want to do. So that's
our goal.
And I'm conﬁdent we'll achieve that goal. And then we've got to ﬁgure out how to
make it at scale, make sure that the robot is safe. I think it's going to be very
important to have a local means of turning it oﬀ. So safety is going to be extremely
important. I can't emphasize that enough. But right now, it is not at an intelligence
level where it's pondering questions like Mars. But perhaps it will be one day.
Hi. Good afternoon, Elon. My name is Luke Arsenault. I just want to start oﬀ by
saying, a big thank you to you and the team at Tesla for all you guys do. It's been
great to see and I'm so happy for you guys.
My question is, with the rise in cybersecurity threats to operational technology and
Internet of Things, what steps is Tesla taking to protect the company itself and its
products from these threats? Also as a suggestion, because I know you like
suggestions. For the navigation, do you think we could do something on the UI thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16

like other map systems do? And then also --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
This is a lot of questions.
One of my friends wanted to get a shocker [ph] from you, if that's possible.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Okay. Well, we are constantly improving the navigation system, and I think robust to
hacking is incredibly important. In fact, we conduct a lot of sort of third-party hacking
contests to try to get the best hackers in the world to break into our cars.
And actually, no one has yet actually broken into a Tesla in a way that would allow
you to really control the car in a signiﬁcant way. But they have gotten to where they
can like honk the horn and mess with the infotainment system. And I'd like to thank
them for their eﬀorts. So we take information security extremely seriously.
For navigation, yeah, there's deﬁnitely things we can improve there. But really, down-
the-road navigation visuals are not going to matter very much because the car is
going to take you wherever you want to go. Yeah. As for pictures, I have to decline,
unfortunately, because otherwise, if I say, I actually hate being rude to people. So if I
say yes to one person, then it's like selﬁes for a zillion, it gets kind of crazy. So -- but
thanks for asking. Maybe we'll take one or two more questions, actually. So, sure.
Hello. I had a question on the eﬃciency. I don't know if you've been paying attention
to Aptera. And I was curious if you thought that was a space that you could see Tesla
getting into as far as not just an eﬃcient manufacturing process, but also the actual
car itself and range. Or just by --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I'm not super familiar with them, but we have a lot of products to get done. It's not
like -- this is -- it's never a shortage of ideas. Frankly, I ﬁnd ideas to be somewhat
trivial, but the execution of the idea is extremely diﬃcult. And like I said, prototypes
are easy, production is hard. Production and cash ﬂow positive is excruciating pain at
a level you cannot believe. So it's not product ideas. They're irrelevant. That's what I
think of them. It's sort of like the idea of going to the moon. That's irrelevant. Getting
to the moon is the hard part. So maybe one last question.

Plaid owner, I would really love to get track mode.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
As a what, sorry?
X Plaid.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, Plaid has track mode.
The Model X Plaid does not, though.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Model X. Yeah, we can probably add that, sure. Yeah, no problem. So Rideshare is --
a bunch of these things will really not be relevant in a self-driving world. You can
summon the car and take you somewhere, and if you want to add someone to that
ride, you can if you want to. But overwhelmingly, it is about achieving self-driving,
Full Self-Driving.
And I think we're really getting to the ﬁnal stages of Full Self-Driving where, I mean, I
drove for several days around Austin, just dropping pins in random locations, and I
had zero safety interventions.
So it's really -- and even in the city of San Francisco, which is very complex, I haven't
had a safety intervention in a long time. So I think it's really getting to the point
where, admittedly, I have been optimistic about this in the past. But I think this time --
all right, I won't say it. All right, fair enough. All right. Okay. I think it will happen. So,
all right, you want to ask one last question?
So, ﬁrst, congratulations on your decision to try advertising. We all want Tesla to
(inaudible) in market cap.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I don't realize people wanted it that much.
Okay. It's good that a lot of people agree. So earlier this year, you cut prices on
everything 15%, 20%. More recently, you've been raising prices on Model Y, Model S,
Model X. And can you just talk about the pricing strategy on Model Y going forwardFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 29 of 31A - Elon R. Musk
A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
A - Elon R. Muskand keep it separate from the decision to bring out the next-gen vehicles that we all
agree is going to blow the doors oﬀ on volume, but just on Model Y, the best selling
product in the world, can you just talk about strategy of pricing going forward on
that?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I mean, it's pretty straightforward. I mean, we see what the demand is and then we
adjust pricing to meet the demand. Now, the thing is that what happens with other
car makers is that they're actually constantly adjusting pricing on cars. It's just not
obvious. In the case of Tesla, you can see immediately when there's a price change
that occurs because we don't have any intermediaries, don't have any dealers.
There's no manufacturers, just retail price.
But the reality is actually at car dealers, the prices are changing radically. I mean, last
year there were signiﬁcant premiums about MSRP at sort of the conventional car
dealer, like, so you'd pay above MSRP last year. And then this year I think things are
below MSRP or close to it. And then the manufacturers will then also oﬀer incentives.
So what's actually happening is are very big price shifts by other car makers, they're
just not obvious, whereas with Tesla, it's obvious.
So -- and this is necessary, because demand ﬂuctuates a lot. So something's got to
be done to achieve a supply-demand clearing point for volume. So just people are
reacting to something that's obvious as opposed to say, oh, yes every car company
does this all the time, Tesla is no exception. That's the actual reality. Alright. Thank
you.
Last question.
I'll be really quick. Okay. So I will say, I have been driving FSD. My wife drives FSD.
There's a term called the wife test. My wife will only drive our kids on FSD. It's
incredible [ph].
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Okay. That is great. I mean, the sort of signiﬁcant other test is a very good test.
Because for a while there was like, friends or signiﬁcant others would be like, please
don't put it on. It's too scary. But then it gets, it's getting to the point where, I mean,
it's going to be just smooth as silk. So, in fact, you'll be able to visually tell, perhaps
even now you can, visually tell if the car is being driven on FSD or manually, because
if it's being driven on FSD, it's smooth and precise.
I mean, if you look at actual -- if you actually closely observe cars going down the
highway. People are constantly moving in their lanes. So the cars are like doing this
all the time when they're manually driven. If it's actually on FSD, it's dead center in
the lane. And it will actually get to the point where it is not merely, and maybe is at
that point, not merely safer than a person, but actually way smoother than manual
driving.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16

A - Elon R. MuskI just -- really, I can't say enough about the profundity of Full Self-Driving. It is just one
of the biggest changes in history that will occur. It's not some feature. It's like a
profound, it's really as profound as electriﬁcation. And we already have millions of
cars on the road that will literally achieve this with a software update, I mean, that's
like head-exploding emoji. And I think probably a lot of people in this room realize it,
but most of the rest of the world doesn't. Yeah, so.
Given how incredible FSD is and how much merit you're giving to potential future
margins of the car, as well as how much an impact on society, and given that they
didn't even want you to say if it's going to happen this year, just not to jinx it, would it
be possible to have just for some type of public-facing, investor-facing kind of
timeline? So that way, you mentioned V12 is coming, and that's AI front-end. Could
we just see kind of a timeline on this is the version we're at, these are the things
we're working on, and this is when we're bringing up, ETA. So we can kind of see
that in real time instead of maybe Elon time.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
So the thing that's been really diﬃcult with Full Self-Driving is that it very often seems
like it's about to happen until you realize that you're actually at a local maximum.
And that you need to re-architect elements of the software to get out of the local
maximum to then a higher local maximum.
So it's been a sort of series of logarithmic curves. And that's why it's been like, it
seemed like, if you just extrapolate this on a straight line it gets to self-driving except
that it's not a straight line, it's a logarithmic curve and you start hitting these local
maxims where you'll sort of asymptote to a certain capability and then have to re-
architect things.
So now I think we're ﬁnally at a high enough local maximum, but we'll be this year to
the point where it is I think probably safer than a person, meaning the probability of
injury on average will be better than a person, even if someone pays no attention to
the car. It is worth saying that right now, for human supervised Tesla Full Self-Driving,
it is dramatically safer than manual driving. It's like, I think like 4x safer, maybe more.
So it is already a massive safety improvement to have human supervised FSD right
now.
And I think we will get to the point where we're always going to be in some amount
of local maximum, but I think that we'll be in a local maximum that exceeds human
level safety this year. Yeah, but I guess we'll see.
So anyway, I want to thank you all for coming. And so, I just want to say, your support
is super appreciated. And as they say, a friend in need is a friend indeed. And
supporting Tesla when the chips are down, those are the real friends, and you're
them. So, thank you. Okay.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-16
