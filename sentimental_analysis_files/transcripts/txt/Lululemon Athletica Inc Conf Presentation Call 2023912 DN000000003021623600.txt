Good morning, and thank you for joining us for this next session of the Goldman
Sachs Global Retailing Conference. My name is Brooke Roach, and I cover the
apparel and accessories brands here at Goldman Sachs. And it is my absolute
pleasure to introduce our next ﬁreside chat with Lululemon. Joining me here today is
Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO. Welcome, Calvin. Welcome,
Meghan.

Thank you.

Thanks for having us.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 20387757 <GO>}
Calvin, maybe we can kick oﬀ the session with an update on your Power of Three x2
growth plan. The plan has been in place for a little over a year now. Where do you
think you've seen the greatest success so far? And where do you still see the most
opportunities?
{BIO 16657186 <GO>}
As you mentioned, we kicked oﬀ Power of Three originally back in 2019, arrived early
on that plan and still so early in the trajectory and growth that our next ﬁve-year plan
picked up on the theme, the Power of Three x2. And we're about a year and a half
into this ﬁve-year plan. It's built upon three pillars of product, guest experience andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12

Page 2 of 12Q - Brooke Roach
A - Calvin McDonaldmarket expansion, underpinned by our Impact Agenda report with goals to double
men's, double e-com, quadruple international while doubling the business. And as
of 2022, we are ahead of schedule. Revenue is 30% versus a goal of 15%. Our men's
business is at 27% versus a growth target of 20%. E-com is 33% versus a growth
target of 16%, and our international 35% versus a growth target of 30%. So great
momentum and success in the business, which we're very excited about equally
though to the opportunities.
We are early in our growth trajectory and opportunity still. And really the growth
drivers are driven by -- our growth continues to be very balanced. So as much as I
just celebrated the key metrics you look at the core strength of the business, our
women's still grew double-digit. Our store still grew double-digit and North America
still grew double-digits. So when I look at the performance of the business across
product and cutting it category, sweat and the diﬀerent men's, women's, we see very
balanced contribution across channel and markets. So then you overlay the growth
drivers of very low unaided brand awareness, single-digit internationally outside of
UK and Australia, where we're low-teens. In the US, we're less than 50% and men's is
in the teens.
So we have signiﬁcant growth potential still in unaided brand awareness. Our
product road map in areas in which we innovate and develop into is signiﬁcant. We
still have a lot of opportunity to keep developing, keep innovating into performance
as well as on-the-move and our international expansion. With 22% of sales last
quarter, and I've said before, this brand is a global brand and has the potential of
being 50-50. So signiﬁcant runway of growth, early innings in our trajectory which is
exciting. So, really to answer the second part of your question, I would say our
successes are our opportunity. And we don't need to deviate from the playbook. The
opportunity really is us just continuing down through the Power of Three what we
know with the guest response to is where we see the growth continue to come from.
{BIO 20387757 <GO>}
That's great color. Thank you so much. Perhaps we can bridge that long-term
opportunity and talk a little bit about some of the recent successes that you've had.
You recently reported results and you mentioned that you'd seen a recent
acceleration in North America. Wondering if you can comment a little bit more on
current trends. What have you seen throughout back-to-school? And what's driving
that acceleration between product or category?
{BIO 16657186 <GO>}
Deﬁnitely, product is core to the growth momentum in our business, and coming out
of quarter two into quarter three and we had a very, very strong quarter two
performance, especially when you compare to the industry to the categories to
others we gained share 1.35% market share. So we continue to put on share driven
by new guest acquisition and then migrating them up through the brand, increasing
the spend. The brand has one of the highest retention ratios that I've ever seen. So
once we get a guest, they really are our guest for a very long -- I don't want to say,
life, but guest for a very long period of time. And as we continue to innovate, we're
able to expand share of wallet with them and that momentum continues.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12

Q - Brooke RoachIn particular, coming out of Q2 into Q3, we continue to see success in our product
and product launches across women's, men's and accessories. And in particular in
men's, we launched two new franchises in our lounge area with Steady State and
Soft Jersey far exceeded our expectations. The team's chasing inventory now
because results have been so strong for us. Equally, we continue to tweak and test
and learn on our digital marketing. So that unaided awareness is a huge opportunity
for us. So we're constantly learning and testing diﬀerent ways, and we just saw a
really good response to our back-to-school messaging, leveraging some of the items
that resonate and work for that across those categories. So there's a variety of drivers
in the North American business that really we saw a nice momentum coming out of a
very strong quarter.
{BIO 20387757 <GO>}
That's really great. You mentioned some of the success that you've seen with some
recent marketing. One of the things that you've highlighted on that last call is that
opportunity for marketing with Get Into It campaign. Can you talk a little bit more
about how we should be thinking about advertising either on an expense basis and
how are you thinking about the outcomes that you're seeing as a result of those early
marketing campaigns that you've been investing behind?
{BIO 16657186 <GO>}
When you think of marketing and brand-building at Lululemon, it deﬁnitely is an end
[ph], building on what has always worked for us and that is grassroots, community
base, building relationships, connections. We've done it in North America. It's what's
fueling our business internationally. It's what's building a very strong foundational
business in a market like China for the brand. And the opportunity and what we are
seeing is going after that unaided awareness through a variety of campaigns, as you
mentioned. And the growth and success of the business is allowing us to reinvest,
test and learn and apply that.
So from a modeling perspective, we shared that we're maintaining our advertising as
a percentage of revenue but higher revenue means we can choose to invest and
have the team try diﬀerent things and really get at that unaided awareness. And
we're doing that, Get Into It campaign was a great example. We saw really good
success. Excited about the second version of that happening in the next few weeks
where men's will play, featuring the whole ABC franchise as well as we're going to
do some test and learn and going out and acquiring Him with some diﬀerent media
channels that we're going to test. So deﬁnitely, an opportunity. Building upon
grassroots and community activations which will always be at the heart of the brands.
But it's a real meaningful opportunity. So we're committed to moving our unaided
awareness up and trying diﬀerent initiatives to do it and staying within the model
that we shared on our Power of Three x2.
{BIO 20387757 <GO>}
Great. On that last comment, you mentioned that you're still in the very early innings
of brand awareness in China speciﬁcally. I wonder if we could dive a little deeper
into the opportunity in that market. You've been growing very strongly there. What is
the customer that you're acquiring in China today? Can you elaborate on the growthFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12

Q - Brooke Roachopportunity ahead? And what are the most important drivers? Is it Tier-2, Tier-3 city
expansion, new-store builds? Where do you see that expansion?
{BIO 16657186 <GO>}
It's deﬁnitely all the above. And I'll come back to guest but we're predominantly in
Tier-1, Tier-2 cities. About a 50-50 split. We have a few stores in Tier-3 and we're just
over 100 doors. We've indicated that we can easily see a path to 200. And as the
economy and that market continues to develop and the middle class expands, I think
there's opportunity beyond that. Every store we opened is far exceeding our internal
plans as well as our online business. So it's very similar and balanced across stores
and channel, very important the role that stores play equally, because stores are the
hub of back to that comment of community grassroots, relationship building. We
have over 500 local ambassadors within that market that we have relationships with
and they represent the brand. They support and activate in our community, and we
really recruit our guests that way as well as what online allows us to do and test and
learn into new markets. So we're pleased with our success momentum, and we
shared our continual growth in China.
And when you look at the guest and we cut it across age, when we cut it across
gender, it's very similar to what we see in North America. Brand is deﬁnitely
positioned premium within that marketplace. And similar to here, there's local
competitors, there's other traditional athletic brands. They discount. They're broadly
distributed through wholesale. We're D2C. We're tightly held. We do not discount
and it's a full price, innovative-driven brand activated through community, and it is
resonating the same way there as it does here in North America.
{BIO 20387757 <GO>}
There's been a few concerns about the health of the economy in China. And I'm
curious if the economy were to weaken in China, what levers can you pull to
continue to drive growth there? And maybe said another way, is your growth outlook
in China in any way dependent on the macro outlook in China?
{BIO 21694519 <GO>}
Yeah. I'd say we obviously continue to really closely monitor the macro environment.
And then as Calvin mentioned, we're really closely monitoring our guest behavior.
We're still really early in our growth trajectory in China, which I think helps us if there
are any near-term headwinds there. I think it's important to note, we take a portfolio
approach to growth. So certainly, other levers and markets we could pull should that
need present itself and plan for multiple scenarios as we navigate. But just to date
we're really pleased with the performance of that market and then how the
consumer there is holding out for us.
{BIO 20387757 <GO>}
Meghan, let's stick with you for a moment and round out the China discussion with a
discussion on margins and international margins. You've recently described China's
margins as the closest to North America of each of your international markets. CanFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12

Q - Brooke Roach
A - Meghan Frankyou describe the key drivers and the potential timeline for a potential narrowing of
that gap?
{BIO 21694519 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean I'd say again, we're still really early in our China opportunity. So the
margins are very healthy. They're the closest to our North America region. And in the
near-term, I'd say our focus is really on driving into the opportunity we have there.
We have low unaided brand awareness as we've discussed, and a lot of store
expansion opportunity in front of us. So really focused on investing into that market,
driving into that opportunity. So I would say over the longer-term, that margin gap
narrowing, but not in the next ﬁve-year trajectory.
{BIO 20387757 <GO>}
Great. Let's zoom out to total Lululemon Inc. You mentioned store growth as an
opportunity in China, but maybe we can talk about the store ﬂeet portfolio
opportunity globally. Where is -- where do you see the most opportunity? And how
much more runway is there for store growth even in your most mature markets?
Maybe said another way, as you increase your penetration of some of those extra
square footage stores, what's the next opportunity from here?
{BIO 21694519 <GO>}
Yeah. So we've got a target right now low-double digit square footage growth. We
feel good about that target. We overachieved that last year. We're on track to that
this year, a little bit ahead. And really, that's a catch-up from COVID impacts and
accelerating on our road map in international. Within the low-double digit growth,
North America is 5% square footage growth and then international, obviously higher.
I would say still a lot of runway in front of us in terms of store openings. We have a
little bit over 600 stores today. So still see store count openings. And then in
addition to that, where we see high sales productivity, high sales per square foot, we
are looking to expand our stores, what we call our co-located strategy. So it gives us
an opportunity to increase our footprint, capitalize on the high traﬃc in that market,
and be able to display a full assortment of women's, men's accessories footwear
products. So that -- we're further along in that strategy in North America, very early
stage in international in both of those components, both in new store and then the
store expansion strategy would play into that square footage growth.
{BIO 20387757 <GO>}
That's really great color. Maybe we can dive just a little bit deeper into that store
productivity comment. You mentioned that sometimes you use high-- highest store
productivity stores to drive co-located expansions. But as you think about the store
productivity that you see in your ﬂeet today, how fast are new stores coming up the
productivity curve? And do you think that there's additional sales per square foot
that can be realized in your current ﬂeet?
{BIO 21694519 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 6 of 12Q - Brooke Roach
A - Calvin McDonaldYeah. I mean that's -- we're very highly productive today. So over 1,600 sales per
square foot on an average for the ﬂeet. I would say we see about two years to three
years today in terms of reaching maturation for a store. And I do see opportunities in
our existing ﬂeet to increase their productivity on a like-for-like basis. But overall,
we're really looking at maximizing both our top and bottom line. So expanding
where that makes sense and really to gauge that we're looking at sales per square
foot traﬃc in that location in order to inform those decisions.
{BIO 20387757 <GO>}
Excellent. Let's switch gears to some of the category comments. And one of the
questions that we are asking every company at our conference today is a question
on category and share of wallet. And there's been a lot of debate about the athletic
category in aggregate, whether or not there's still opportunity for that category to
continue to gain share of wallet in the consumer following several years of very
strong performance.
As you look into next year, what is the most important factor to drive higher
spending in the athletic category in aggregate? And what do you think is Lulu's
opportunity to continue to gain share?
{BIO 16657186 <GO>}
I think in good times and in challenging times what a brand needs to do is just give
reason for guests to buy and have that not be priced, which we continue to see in
the market and those around us pull that lever when they don't have true innovation.
So for us -- both, I think anyone competing as well as for us, we focus on innovation
as the driver of demand creation. And how we approach innovating in apparel is
through, one, obsessing over unmet needs by the guest. So where can we bring
solutions?
Second, very much rooted in science's feel. It all starts at the fabric level for us. We
have an incredible team. They obsess over performance of fabrics, feel of fabric. So
those in the room that are Lululemon guests, I'm sure when you think of the product
you love most, at some point, feel comes to mind, how it feels on, how it feels to
touch, how it feels to perform. That doesn't just happen, that's the obsession of our
innovation and where we begin with proprietary fabrics technology and a pipeline
full of ideas that we continue to innovate and will bring forth. So those combined
with the versatility.
One of the other things rooted in the success of Lululemon, I think, is just the
versatile nature of the product, and that could be across performance. We don't
think through verticals. Yes, we market or design for run, but it can be used for many
activities. And really across all of our activity base, we take that approach. Yoga, Run
and Train being sort of the three primary, we call, own activities, but golf, hike and
tennis being our play activities. But the versatility across all those is that you can
interchange and where it's actually performing or not performing. And I think the
quality combined with the feel, the innovation, the ﬁt and the versatility of that just
resonates with the guest and is deﬁnitely how we create product and what the guest
expects from the brand. And we're going to continue to do that because we seeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 7 of 12Q - Brooke Roach
A - Calvin McDonaldsuccess in driving our business clearly through product and product innovation. And
we do believe we're leaders in innovating apparel athletic, which stretches across
wear occasions from sweat through to every day.
{BIO 20387757 <GO>}
That's really great color. One of the areas that you've also been innovating is in bags
and accessories, and that's been a category with standout performance the last year
or so. As you begin to comp those tougher compares, maybe at the belt bag or
other accessories items, how are you thinking about the opportunity of the total
bags category now that you've seen some of those early successes? Help us dream
the dream of understanding the innovation pipeline in some of those newer
emerging categories.
{BIO 16657186 <GO>}
We're really excited about the success and momentum and growth we're seeing in
our accessory business. It's about 10% of our overall sales, and we see a signiﬁcant
opportunity to keep developing into that category. I think the non-luxury bag
business globally is around $110 billion. We have less than 1% share. Other players in
that have around 2% to 3% share. So it's deﬁnitely very fragmented, but we have
room for growth. And that growth is going to be split across use cases of both
performance in every day and performance -- we have a lot of opportunity in and
around hiking, in and around to and from, but then just every day totes and other
opportunities. And -- so we're excited. We've seen great success to our Backpack
program that we've launched this year, revised improvements on that.
And as it relates to the Everywhere Belt Bag, we are cycling over the success from
last year, and our accessory business was up 41% as a category last quarter. So the
beauty of successes is that you can keep building upon these successes. And I think
one of the diﬀerentiators of Lululemon is our success isn't rooted in fashion. It is
fashionable and that people feel good in what they wear, but it's not where we
begin. We begin with unmet needs through science of feel, performance, and that
means we have a very healthy core business that is less risky in terms of the seasonal
and fashionable ﬂuctuations. We play color and others on top of that. But it's a 50%
core base business.
And in our accessories and with Everywhere Belt Bags, the team is building
iterations. They're adding diﬀerent fabrics and color waves to that, building out the
franchise. But we're continuing to see the stickiness of that product. We're
expanding it into being a legitimate player in the bag accessory business. And as I
said, seen good success in the ﬁrst quarter that we're comping with innovation that
we will build upon, build out and leverage that relationship with the guests. And the
number of new guests that we saw come into the brand through that product, both
spread skewed a little bit younger, but we're not just young, but the team is doing a
great job in building, strengthening the relationship and expanding them into the
brand. So we're excited about the potential we have in accessories and the
Everywhere Belt Bag when you get a hit success like that, I think it's just positive to
the brand.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12

You mentioned innovation, not price as a key driver of your growth. And one of the
questions we're asking everyone at our conference today is their outlook for pricing.
So maybe we can take that now. Now that inﬂation seems to have peaked, how are
you thinking about pricing into 2024? Are you planning on raising, lowering or
maintaining your core prices?
{BIO 21694519 <GO>}
Yeah, we haven't used price as a lever to drive our business. We've really maintained
our posture on pricing, which is looking -- obviously, being mindful of the
competitive landscape, but looking at the quality and make of our goods
functionality. We did take modest price increases on about 10% of our assortment
last year, so not a material increase. And we'll employ the same strategy going
forward. So no plans to veer from that to date.
{BIO 20387757 <GO>}
Meghan, maybe we can stick with you and what goes hand-in-hand with pricing is
also inventories. I'm curious if you can provide a little bit more color on the inning
that you think we're in for your company on inventories as well as what that means
for -- how you think about your inventories in relation to the rest of retail.
{BIO 21694519 <GO>}
Yeah. So I think the team has done a really great job managing inventory levels with
demand. So certainly, navigating a challenging supply chain dynamic and leveraging
airfreight where that made sense to really meet that customer demand. We've got
about 45% of our inventory in core product, which has limited markdown exposure
for us. So that's the beneﬁt that we've leveraged as we've navigated this time period.
We came in at the end of this quarter, up 14%. We had expected approximately 20%.
So a combination of higher sales, lower airfreight costs and then some timing
impacting that. We are expecting to be in the high-single digits to low-double digits
at the end of Q3 and then in line with sales growth at the end of Q4. So really call it
inventory position. We're pleased with where we are today. I think over the long-
term, we still have an opportunity to move back to historical turns in terms of
inventory, but feel really well positioned.
{BIO 20387757 <GO>}
And then on that, last year, you had a little higher levels of inventory and also we saw
some normalization in markdowns and even particularly in the fourth quarter, the
Lulu customer engaged in a greater way with markdown product than they had in
the past. Is there an opportunity to recapture some of that markdown pressure from
last year?

Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 9 of 12Q - Brooke Roach
A - Meghan Frank
Q - Brooke Roach
A - Calvin McDonaldYeah. I'd say when I zoom out on an annual basis in '22, we were ﬂat to 2019 in terms
of markdown rate, which is a really low level and normalized healthy water line for us.
We are expecting this year, again, from an annual perspective, ﬂat '22 and ﬂat to
2019. We are ﬂat year-to-date, essentially ﬂat year-to-date. Q4 was a little bit higher
last year, partially driven by, I think, what was going on in the environment with
inventory in the marketplace. And we saw some consumer behavior diﬀerences from
historical. That said, I think we still expect ﬂat for the year. There might be a modest
improvement in Q4 as we lap that quarter.
{BIO 20387757 <GO>}
And maybe putting all this together, as we think about the innovation and growth
opportunities that you have in the Power of Three x2 plan, what you're seeing in
inventory and markdown in pricing. Meghan, can you talk a little bit more about that
long-term margin opportunity? How are you thinking about balancing the gross
margin opportunities with some of your margin dilutive growth drivers such as men's
or international? And what other levers do you have to drive modest operating
margin expansion in the business overall into next year?
{BIO 21694519 <GO>}
Yeah. So we feel really good about our target of modest operating margin
expansion. We're overdelivering on that this year. So we guided to 40 basis points to
60 basis points of op margin expansion for the full year. So ahead of that modest
target.
I would say when we look over this ﬁve-year time horizon, there's some puts and
takes on margins. So we've got scale of business, particularly in women's and North
America as a beneﬁt. And then we also have some airfreight recovery more modest,
given the progress we've made year-to-date. And then oﬀsetting that would be
expansion into men's, some expansion in international at a higher penetration and
then new categories such as footwear. But the net of that makes us conﬁdent in our
ability to deliver on that modest operating margin expansion target.
{BIO 20387757 <GO>}
Calvin, one of the questions that we're asking every company at our conference
today is on the consumer backdrop. As you think about the consumer into next year,
do you think this consumer is going to be facing more headwinds or less compared
to 2023? And how are you thinking about the potential trade-up or trade-down
demographic shift by income cohorts?
{BIO 16657186 <GO>}
I think the challenges in the marketplace are going to continue in terms of where the
consumer is. In saying that, I go back to reasons to buy. If you give the consumer a
reason to buy, if they see value in that choice, then they'll continue to spend. And I
think the success that we've seen in our brand through a pressuring of the consumer
and where they choose to spend, be it experiences or on products in a market in
which many have used discount as a lever to course correct lack of innovation and
demand or to rightsize their inventory, we've said we didn't have an inventory issue.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12

Page 10 of 12Q - Brooke Roach
A - Calvin McDonald
Q - Brooke RoachWe worked through our inventory through full price. We made the investment in
inventory because we saw the demand and we saw the challenges on freight, and
we wanted to make sure we had the product to satisfy the demand, and we operated
through the entire pandemic that way.
There was the discussions of pre-pandemic winners, pandemic winners, post-
pandemic winners and you can't be all three. And I think this leadership team, I'm
very proud of the way that we took deliberate actions, made deliberate decisions
that fueled the business, allowed us to continue the momentum through those tough
operating conditions. And '23 is no diﬀerent, but we stay true to the strength of the
brand, innovate product, full price, resonate and connect through community and
leverage the stores as well as digital and innovate, innovate, innovate.
And in '23 through to '24, that's going to be the continual playbook. The pipeline for
the back half of this year is really exciting, sort of teased a launch of the category for
Her coming in Q3 that I'm super excited about. Next year, we have a lot of
innovation. We're launching our men's footwear in addition to women's and a lot of
other innovations.
So to me, what we don't know is only what the future will bear. We plan, we have
agility. I think we have a proven track record of when the storm comes in, how this
brand responds, how this team responds, and how the guest responds to the
product. Pandemic is probably the best example of that. And we just got stronger
and adjusted and managed our way through.
So we're going to lead in with innovation and continue to have agility in the system.
And that means where we take bets, where we invest, the ability to pull back if we
need to pull back, where we lean in, where we want to lean, satisfy demand, but all
of that is rooted in making sure that we always lead with innovative product, selling it
to the guest in a way in which he and she will respond. And that's really what we're
planning and continuing as we move forward.
{BIO 20387757 <GO>}
Maybe one last question for you, Calvin. Innovation has been the key theme of
today's session. And you've talked about the accelerating pipeline of innovation that
you have. You talked about the opportunity for men's footwear launches next year, a
broader innovation category across bags. What's fueling that faster pace of
innovation relative to what you've seen historically? And how are you making the
decisions to lean into certain innovation that in key categories or key items? How are
you thinking about putting that together as you look ahead?

To speed up. I think it's a combination of focus and clarity for the entire team. As I
mentioned, the Power of Three x2 is our second version of Power of Three, and that
was very much rooted in innovation. Our pipeline and our horizons of innovating, we
really look across a three-year horizon. Some things are three-plus years and horizon
one might be in the zero to one, zero to two-year time horizon. So I think what you're
seeing now and what is coming is the framework and the development of the team
that started in the Power of Three. And we're just seeing a lot of that horizon three
ideas, dreaming the dream, focusing on the unmet needs, what are the solutions we
can create, and the teams working collectively together that are moving into
horizons two, horizons one, which we're launching.
So I think it's been a multiyear focus of the team driven by strategy across the three
ownable activities into the three play categories, never losing sight of versatility,
rooted inside to ﬁll an unmet need. And we're just at that point now where that
rhythm is delivering consistent product execution, and '23 is a good example of that.
'22 was a great year for innovation for us as well. Launch of women's footwear,
launch of a lot of our play activities, continuing to invest and launch into both OTM
as well as into Yoga and Run and Train. So I think it is just where we are in that
development and the fact that it's a continual focus for the organization.
And as I shared, our opportunity as we expand wear occasions into OTM in
particular, on the move for Her, where we're much more developed for Him, and it is
completely a new opportunity for us. So there's a lot of exciting things to come and
very much rooted in a very deliberate framework that is going to bring and create a
ton of exciting solutions for our guests.
