Good afternoon, I'm Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. It's my privilege and
pleasure to welcome you this afternoon to the Walmart presentation at our 37th
Annual Institutional Investors Conference. I trust everybody had a good lunch.
With us today from Walmart we are very pleased to have Brett Biggs, Chief Financial
Oﬃcer of the Company. And giving the presentation today we have Steve Bratspies
who was recently named the Chief Merchandising Oﬃcer of the Company. Without
any further ado, Steve, the ﬂoor is yours.
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Thanks, Budd. Good afternoon, everybody.
As Budd mentioned I've been Chief Merchandising Oﬃcer just a short period of
time, almost ﬁve months now in the Company. But I've been with Walmart for about
a decade. So I've been a lot of diﬀerent things at the Company, marketing and
merchandising. And now have the honor to lead a great merchandising team at
Walmart US that I'm very proud of.
We got a great, strong leadership team, a really good plan that we're very focused
on delivering. And what I want to spend a little bit of time with you today is give you
a top line of what that plan is and what we're focused on but more importantly I want
to go into merchandising. I want dive down and talk to about what I'm focused on,
what my team is focused on to help deliver the US plan.
To start I always have to put the forward-looking statements disclaimer up. You guys
all know this, you know it better than I do but Budd put it up there just so we're all
covered. Any questions you can see it at our website as we go forward.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-08

Page 2 of 15So let me talk to you about growth and I want to start by taking a quick step back, a
quick look back at the release that we just made. We just made our Q4 release a
couple of weeks ago. And comp sales in the US were positive for the sixth
consecutive quarter at 60 basis points driven by the ﬁfth consecutive quarter of
positive traﬃc growth in the stores.
Neighborhood markets delivered nearly a 7 comp during that time. And as you know
we've been investing heavily in our business, heavily in our people, in the talent and
technology. And it's really starting to pay oﬀ for us as we can see improving
customer experience scores across the US business.
Global e-commerce sales were at 8% for the Fourth Quarter and 12% for the year last
year on a constant currency basis. We expanded our online grocery business to 22
markets and we will do about another 20 markets this year as we continue to invest
in that business and continue to ﬁnd the intersection of physical and digital.
We're getting great responses from our customers on this with satisfaction scores
already in the mid-90s. So we feel good about where we're going on that.
So lots of progress that we feel good about but we know we have a lot of work to
do. And we're very focused on delivering in the future for our customers and for our
shareholders.
And for us to do that it really all begins with our customer. I want to spend a little bit
of time talking about the customer today, a little bit of a deeper dive understanding
and some of the things that we're learning as we go forward.
The customer today is changing dramatically. Who they are, what they want, how
they shop, where they shop, when they shop, lots of diﬀerent changes that are going
all at one time. 79 million of them are millennials and what's great is they are moving
into prime spending years.
They started a little slower in household formation, they are moving faster and they
are in that time right now. 48% of them are multicultural versus 28% from the
boomers which is a dramatic shift and a dramatic change in the business. They are
the most value-driven generation that we've seen in my lifetime, slightly ahead of
Gen X. But they are very, very focused on value which aligns well for Walmart.
And they also have the strongest aﬃnity for Walmart of any of the generations. 66%
of millennials have shopped at a Walmart store in the past month. And they are more
likely than the total population to shop Walmart stores.
So it's a very important customer to us and one that aligns very well with our
business. Busy customers, they are demanding new level of convenience, new
expectations. Really what they want is they want to see more shopping experience.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 15They want to shop Walmart. They don't care if it's online, they don't care if it's
mobile, they don't care if it's in the store. They want it to be a seamless shopping
experience for them and that's what we're working on delivering.
And we're seeing some good results. We continue to capture more than our fair
share of millennial customer spending, especially those millennials that have kids
already. We increased our market share with millennial moms by 450 basis points
over the last two years.
And a lot of people ask why are we doing that? What's working? Fundamentally it's
because we have the products that they want.
They like our grocery, they like our baby assortment which is obviously very
important to them at the stage of life that they are in right now. Convenient locations,
they deﬁnitely subscribe to the one-stop shopping. Again you're talking young
families, household formations, one-stop shopping is a huge convenience to them.
And ultimately our low-price model and budget approach to shopping works very
well for them as they are very value conscious.
Our best shoppers are the ones who shop with us not only in stores but they shop
online. And if you think about that intersection of physical and digital that we talk a
lot about as a Company plays out in how customers spend. They spend more, they
shop more frequently when they shop all channels.
So just some numbers for you. Walmart store-only customer spends on average
about $1,400 a year and online customer only spends a couple hundred dollars. The
customer who shops both, online and in the store, spends about $2,500 with us on
average in a year.
So that customer in the middle of the intersection of those two circles is incredibly
valuable for us. And as they continue to build that behavior we're going to continue
to take advantage of it.
So let me take a minute and give you a high-level Walmart US strategy. And this is
nothing new, you've heard this from us before, Greg Foran, my boss, has talked
about this. But I thought it would be just to set the context quickly for what we're
trying to do.
And ultimately that's to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. We think
we're well-positioned to do that in a way that no one else has been able to do that
so far. And there's four key planks to enable us to do that.
Number one, winning with stores. It's all about what we're doing to provide an
excellent experience for our customers who are there. We made a lot of investments
in that area and people and the technology that make our stores fundamentally run
better.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 15The second is delivering value. Low price has always been our key diﬀerentiator in
the market and we're going to continue. As we invest to grow we're going to
continue to invest in price and we're not going to compromise on any quality or any
products as we do that. So price and quality investments are going to be very
important to us going forward.
The third one, which is near and dear to my heart, being great merchants. We've got
to run great stores and we've got to have great product in that stores. And as
merchants we have to think through how the product ﬂows into the store, how it
ﬂows to the shelf all the way out through the register making that a seamless as
possible for our stores so they can operate better. It's about great products,
executing great programs in our stores, seasonal programs and bringing to life great
brands.
And ﬁnally it's about providing convenience. We really believe that we're uniquely
positioned with the footprint that we have on a physical basis to add the digital to
that and provide a seamless shopping experience for merchandise across all
channels as we go forward. So that's the US strategy.
Let me talk to you about merchandising. Let me talk to you about what I'm focused
on, what my team is focused on every single day to make our business better. And
it's three things: it's customer advocacy, it's continuing to improve our cost position
and it's service to our stores.
Let me touch on each one of these for a minute. Customer advocacy, it's pretty self-
explanatory but it really just means being obsessed with customers. It's putting the
customer at the center of every single thing that we do and creating experience for
them that is valuable, fun, exciting and basically worth their time. That's what we
have to do and we have to keep focusing on them all the time.
Our cost position, you know this Company is built on the promise and the purpose
of save money, live better. It always has been and it always will be.
It's what we're known for and it's what we stand for. And we're going to consistently
guard that position in the marketplace and make investments over time to make sure
that we provide the absolute best value for our customers.
And to do that we have to run a strong EDLC model. We have to continue to take
costs out of our business to be able to invest in price as we go forward.
And ﬁnally service to our stores. If you're a merchant at Walmart you serve two
bosses. You serve the customer number one and number two you serve the stores.
Your job is to help the stores run more eﬃcient. How do they improve their
eﬃciencies once again so we can take cost out. So we can continue to invest in our
business. We have a lot of aggressive plans around order ﬁll rates, greater eﬃciencyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 15at the shelf, improved speed and creating a lot more customized programs at the
local level to drive our business.
What I want to talk to you mostly today is about the ﬁrst one which is customer
advocacy and what do we do to drive loyalty to create a better customer experience
and ultimately to earn the trust of our customers so that they continue to come back
time and time again. So the ﬁrst piece of customer advocacy where we need to start
is about fresh business.
Why do we start with fresh? Because when you walk into a Walmart store what is the
ﬁrst thing you see? You see fresh.
It sets the tone for the experience of your entire shopping trip with Walmart. It's a
huge priority for us because it's a big traﬃc driver and it's very important to our
customers. And we know when we get fresh right the entire box beneﬁts from that
business as we go forward.
We've got really comprehensive plans we call it all the way from farm to fork. So what
do I mean by that? We're looking at how we source product, where we source it from
globally, how we change seasons more eﬀectively all the way to fork.
It's not just about having fresh product in our store, it needs to be fresh when you
take it home. When you experience it two or three days later out of your refrigerator
it needs to still be fresh product. How do we extend that over time and that's
ultimately our focus.
People often ask what's diﬀerent, what am I going to see in your stores? When you
go into our stores this year I think you're going to see a couple of things. One, you're
going to see better assortment, improved quality, better presentation of product.
The wet wall in our produce area is diﬀerent. It's been ﬂipped. We're going to lead
oﬀ with fresh bulk vegetables that set a fresher tone right on actionality.
We've expanded space for cut fruit which is a huge growth business for us. We've
changed our assortment mix between bagged and bulk product, all to make sure
the assortment is better for the customer.
The shopping experience is going to be diﬀerent. We're rolling out a project that we
call fresh angle rollout. And what that is is when you walk into a produce department
we're reorienting all the ﬁxturing in there and lowering the proﬁle.
So you're going to be able to come in, you're going to have more space, you're
going to have more sightlines, able to see the wet wall, see the deli, easier to shop,
it's going to change dramatically the look and feel of our produce department. We
have it in 180 stores right now, it will be in about 3,300 by the end of the year. So a
pretty big rollout for us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 15And also much better in-store execution. We've made a lot of investment in wages,
as you all know about, adding department managers back. We're also adding in
what we call a fresh operations manager at the market level to have an expert in
every single market to teach, train and build capabilities in the stores on an ongoing
basis.
And ultimately as I talked about earlier, better freshness. Freshness is the key. It's
how you actually judge the product and we've taken a full day at inventory out of our
supply chain over the last year to make sure that we continue to provide that fresher
experience.
So we're optimistic about our growth in this area and we are already seeing some
great results. 52-week produce market share up 44 basis points. Organic market
share up 80 basis points in the last 52 weeks.
So the customer is responding to what we're doing. We expect these investments to
pay oﬀ in the short term and long term and we're pretty conﬁdent about what we're
doing. And the customer perception improvement that we're seeing across the
department is the best measure to tell us that we're working on the right things.
The second area, how do we build relationships and trust with customer is private
brands. And we've always had a big private brand business across Walmart. And it's
across the entire business: GM, soft lines, food, consumables.
But customers are asking more and more for more private brand. It's a key loyalty
driver and those customers who participate in private brands they make more trips
and they spend more. And when they come and they make those incremental trips
50% of what they spend is on branded product.
So we know what they're doing as it is building a more engaged relationship and it's
a deeper penetration of how they shop Walmart and why they shop Walmart. The
penetration of brand, private brands is increasing both in SKU count and in new
items. So the density of that in our stores is going to continue to increase.
We believe winning with private brands comes down to three things: it's price,
innovation and quality. And we're spending a lot of eﬀort to invest in product
development, sourcing, technology, new talent to be able to build this business.
For those of you who visit us in Bentonville every once in a while I encourage you to
come see us. We're building a best-in-class product development and sensory lab
right in Bentonville, right at our home oﬃce that we'll have open in just a couple of
months which will give us a whole new level of capability for us to build as we go
forward.
One of the questions I get asked all the time when I talk about private brands is well
you have always said you're a house of brands. So what does that mean, how do youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 15think about that? And what I would you is we always have been a house of brands
and we always will be a house of brands. National brands are incredibly important to
us number one because our customers want them, number two it's a fundamental
part of the EDLP program.
We show price value by customers comparing national brands to one another. So
none of that is changing as we do this but it's going to be a balance of both as we
go forward.
The next business that really is growing and becoming a more and more important
part of our business is our health and wellness area. Everybody knows that
healthcare always ranks among the top concern of the entire population let alone
just our customers and as boomers age more and more this is going to become a
bigger and bigger issue for society. That's why we're continuing to invest and
expand our portfolio here to serve customers better and for us it's all about access
and aﬀordability in this area.
Today we operate 4,500 pharmacies, 2,900 vision centers, all demonstrating strong
growth across the business. We're working really hard how do we engage these
customers even further and this is an area where health and wellness it's all about
trust. When you look at a customer I have to trust you in my health and wellness
business and the best measure I have to show trust is our immunizations business
has doubled in the last year.
So to me there's nothing that says trust more than I'm going to let you stick a needle
in me in the middle of a store. So we feel pretty good about that as a good leading
indicator that customers trust us more and more as we go forward.
Just to give you one example of something that we're doing in this business area, it's
called the America's Biggest Health Fair. And we did it the ﬁrst time in October
where in a four-day period we delivered 50,000 immunizations, 280,000 health
screenings and we distributed almost 200 million healthy product samples.
And we look at those numbers and we say wow, that's great, the scale of our ability
to do this. But what's really powerful about this is when you take it down to an
individual customer. And we got dozens and dozens of stories coming out of this
health fair and just one that I will share with you.
There was a woman in one of our stores in Atlanta who came in and had a blood
pressure screening. And the store immediately called 911. They took this woman to
the hospital.
Her blood pressure was 255 over 160. And she was about to have a stroke or a heart
attack. And the doctors and her family contacted the store afterwards and said she
was going to have a major medical event within a few hours if she had not been in a
Walmart store at this health fair and gotten her blood pressure checked.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 15So it's just one example. Again the numbers are big but we like to take it all the way
down to an individual customer. Some pretty powerful stuﬀ that we can do for our
customers to help them on the live better part of our promise.
Convenience. How do we improve customer experience? How do we think about
shopping in the future and how do we change our business as we go forward?
Nearly 90% of the US population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart store. So we have
access basically to the entire US population just based on our current layout in our
stores. So we're going to continue to provide more access and more convenience to
those customers in three key ways.
The ﬁrst is with pick up. And we're really making some good meaningful progress
here. Customers keep telling us how much they like this.
This is when a customer goes online, orders an item and they come to the store and
they pick it up for free, often within the same day. It's been a real priority for us over
the last year. The business spiked dramatically during the holiday time.
Lots of huge volume. That volume has continued on. Customers are excited about it.
It provides instant easier access to the great assortment that we have in a store
without them having to go do a lot of the work.
The second piece is online grocery. I mentioned it earlier but customers love the
ability to shop online, order their groceries and come to a store, never even get out
of their car. Open their trunk we'll put the groceries in their trunk for them and move
right on.
These customers represent a larger basket and many of them are new incremental
customers to Walmart. And as I said earlier, customer satisfaction is in the 90s of this
business. Customers really like it. We've expanded it to over 20 markets already and
we'll do another 20 markets as we roll out this year to continue to build this
business.
And the ﬁnal piece is the Walmart app and it's one of the top three apps in retail.
We've got tens of millions of customers who use it. And it's all about continuing to
add new tools, new capabilities to the app.
It's pretty helpful today you want to go shop a Supercenter to ﬁnd the product and
the aisle locater where you want that product. But recently we added to it when we
introduced Walmart Pay which is an example of how this app gives customers a
seamless experience between digital and physical. It just takes the digital world and
brings it to the store and makes the store that much more convenient, that much
simpler.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 15It's a really, really cool application. It's unbelievably simple and we'll be rolling that
out to the rest of the country through the ﬁrst half of this year.
I really believe in this area going back to that 90% or within 10 miles we can do what
nobody else can really do eﬀectively big in scale and that's marry e-commerce with a
physical location. And that's what we're really focused on rolling out over the next
couple of years.
Everything I just said is always powered and anchored in what you know from us
which is we're going to be running an EDLP business and we're going to power it by
EDLC. We're going to deliver that consistent, stable pricing that builds trust with our
customers. That's why they come back to us because they trust the price that they're
getting from us every single day.
To do that and do that really well you have to continue to improve our low-cost
position. We're doing a lot of work to drive cost out of our system across the entire
franchise.
A few things we're doing speciﬁcally that we focus on is taking most of the co-op
marketing out of our business and encouraging our supplier partners to put that into
the cost of goods, reducing the number of tabs that we have in the marketplace. We
had over 100 a few years ago. We will be down under 20 yes we go forward. We're
working to get to more consistent terms and allowances to take cost out of the
business operating with our suppliers and looking at every single aspect of our
business from sourcing to logistics to technology to how do we continue to improve
our cost position so ultimately we can deliver on our EDLP promise to our customers
and not compromise on the quality.
So as a merchant I couldn't stand here today and not talk to you about some items
because we know -- Budd, we talked about it earlier, we're an item-driven business,
we always have been and we're always going to continue to be. So I want to share
just a couple of items with you that are examples of great EDLPs that you can ﬁnd in
our store right now.
So last year -- I'm grabbing some products -- last year we sold a $1.68 cami in our
store, sold millions of items and it's this program called Shocking Value that we have
in apparel business. We're following that up this year with a $2.87 No Boundary T-
shirt. When we're all done I'd encourage you to come up, feel the quality on this,
touch this product.
This is an incredible quality product for $2.87. You're going to see massed out tables
in our stores, great arrangement of colors, really, really looks good.
We'll also going to have a lot of fun this summer with a product called bubble
wands. We're going to sell a six pack of bubble wands for $3.88. You say okay, that
sounds good.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 15Budd BugatchWe're going to sell 6 million of them. Last year this product was $4.97 and we sold 1
million of them. This year we're going to sell 6 million at $3.88.
And how are we going to do that? One, roll back of the price because you are going
to see mass displays right in front of the customer. It's a great item that we'll have a
lot of fun with.
And the last one is a great seasonal item which is Peeps. As we head into Easter time
I'm sure you have all had Peeps and I'm sure you all love the taste of Peeps.
Well we're going to sell them at $1 this year and which will be a 20%, 25% value to
anyone in the market. And we also have what we call Mystery Peeps. There are three
mystery ﬂavors this year. So I'd encourage you to go try them.
They are only at Walmart. And they will reveal them the week of Easter.
But just examples of fun, exciting items at great prices to make a diﬀerence in our
business. So as we work on building a fresh business, as we work on building a
global e-commerce business the one thing we're never going to forget and we're
never going to walk away from as Walmart is great item merchandising at EDLP
pricing because that's what drives our business and that's what our customers love
when they come to see us.
So let me just wrap up my time with you and just kind of leave you with a couple of
thoughts. One, I think we've got a really clearly deﬁned strategy in the US. It's about
winning with stores, it's about delivering value, being great merchants and then
providing convenience to our customers.
My role, my team's role, merchandising's focus is about executing that strategy. And
what are we focused on? We're going to be focused on the customer.
We're going to put the customer at the center of everything that we do. We're very
focused on improving our cost position so we can invest in price over time and make
sure that we serve stores as eﬀectively as we possibly can.
I think we're on the right path. Traﬃc, comps, satisfaction with the customer all
improving. We're working on the right things and we're encouraged about our
progress so far.
So thank you for your time. And I guess, Budd, we'll do some questions.

As you continue to grow the health and wellness franchise and look to strengthen
your cost position there are examples in the market of it deals directly between for
instance pharma companies and pharmacies like the Walgreens Valeant deal. As you
evaluate your relationships with the wholesalers like an AmerisourceBergen or
McKesson can you just talk about how you view those relationships versus going
directly to the large pharma companies given your scale?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks for the question. I would say very important relationships to us and there
has been a lot of change in the marketplace over the last couple of years, diﬀerent
mergers, diﬀerent programs going on. We're always looking at options to ﬁgure out
what's the best way to run our business.
It's a business that we're going to continue to invest in. It's incredibly important to us
and to our customers. So we're going to always evaluate what the best way for us to
do that but those relationships that brought us this far in this business are very
important to us and we'll continue to build upon.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Questions? I'll ask one.
Several years ago at this conference Bill Simon made a really good case about the
outsized market share that Walmart had of the weekly shop and part of the impetus
of the Neighborhood Market and Walmart Express test was to develop a better
market share of the midweek shop. Can you give is kind of an update of where we
are in that process and what the current thinking is of the leadership?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Sure, thanks, Budd. Yes. Worth looking at, when you run a business the size that we
run we need to participate in every shopping trip that exists out there. And one of
the reasons we continue to lean into and invest in the Neighborhood Markets
franchise is it serves that need really, really well.
It's our convenience format which customers like to do the smaller shopping trip to
as they go forward. We will build 85 to 95 more of them this year than we have
going forward. So we're good to continue to invest. We're working, all the programs
that I talked about today apply to Neighborhood Markets as well.
Improving our fresh business there, making it more convenient. We continue to lean
into pickup in those stores to make them more productive as we go forward. But that
midweek shopping trip continues to be a big part of how customers are shoppingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-08

A - Steve Bratspiesand changing their behavior and we're using the Neighborhood Markets particularly
to go after that.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
And you have been you've been redoing the Neighborhood Markets to get that.
How does that feel, where are you now in that innovation?
You've made a couple of new Neighborhood Markets near the home oﬃce that have
had some diﬀerent items. Where are we on that?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Yes. We had. There's a couple of diﬀerent protos that we're working on in our local
area near our oﬃce. A couple of things.
We're changing the fresh layout in those stores, lowering proﬁles, creating more
shopping space, adding to the assortment there in fresh, building out our deli
business and adding more capabilities. We have things like new pizza programs and
things like that in those businesses. Making those stores more convenient by
splitting the aisles.
A lot of times you go into Walmart one of the complaints customers have the long
runs. So in Neighborhood Markets in the new protos they are split ﬁles which creates
more opportunity for us.
We're expanding the baby department in Neighborhood Markets in stores that it
makes sense, all to serve the customer better over time. So just a few examples of
things that we're working on.
Some time ago I read a story that you are closing down shops in let's say rural areas
because the population was not big enough. Do you plan to address that issue with
let's say drop-oﬀ stations or something like that to give them at least a chance to buy
something?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
So let me just start with closing stores. We did close about 150 stores at the end of
last year which was really part of a very large, comprehensive global portfolio review
as to where we are in terms of what are the best assets that we have, how do we
optimize them and where do we want to invest and where do we not want to invest?
The total closures of that business was less than 1% of our total square footage on a
global basis. So not a tremendous amount. But all of those stores in the US were our
Express stores and many of those were located in some rural areas.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-08

A - Steve BratspiesThat Express store pilot that we ran, I think it was 105 stores I think is the exact
number, basically we decided that it didn't ﬁt the model of operating that we wanted
to have in the future. Many of those locations we actually wished we had built a
Neighborhood Market in, quite frankly. So as we've gotten more encouraged with
our Neighborhood Market results we don't think or we know that the Express
business doesn't ﬁt into a model as we go forward.
In terms of reaching more rural areas, that's a real estate kind of analysis play that
we'll always do. We're always looking for new markets. We're going to continue to
build stores.
We're just not going to build Express stores in those markets. If we build them we
are going to build a Supercenter or we're going to build a Neighborhood Market.
So the Company's unilateral decision to raise wages which has increased your US
cost structure by $2.7 billion, doesn't that really inhibit your ability to invest in price
and thus drive any kind of comp going forward?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
So the $2.7 billion is an investment that we made for a couple of diﬀerent reasons.
One, we need to invest in our associates in our stores which has always been a
strong plank for Walmart in the US and around the globe. So we wanted to invest in
them.
Part of that investment was also adding labor to the stores. So adding department
managers, adding technology, adding capabilities to serve customers much better in
our stores. So $2.7 billion, that's not a small number. We made a big investment
which obviously you saw what it did to how we positioned ourselves from an
earnings perspective. But what we think that is going to do is position is for the long
term to grow our comp sales business as we continue to invest and make the
experience in our stores better.
For price I talked about what we're trying to do on cost, continue to take cost out of
the system. This year we're going to start to invest in price again as a business and
you're going to see a multibillion-dollar investment over the next couple of years.
The approach that we basically took was. And I think Doug or Greg have used this
phrase before, you can't invite people over to your house for dinner before you
clean up the house and that's what we needed to do.
And we didn't think spending a lot of money on price before we improved the
performance of our stores, before we improved the experience would be a prudent
investment. Now that we're getting to the point we feel better about how our stores
are being run, how they are being operated, the customer experience in there we're
ready to start spending money against price.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-08

A - Budd BugatchOur fast, clean and friendly scores, which is how we ultimately measure the metrics
of our operators right now, we put a very high bar in place for them last year. 76% of
the stores reached that bar and then we ﬂipped the calendar and we raised the bar
again and they are working back up to climbing that ladder to have better fast
scores, better cleanliness scores and more convenient stores for customers.
Once we have that we're good to continue to invest in price.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Just piggybacking on your last comment, one of the big issues has been the back
rooms, cleaning up the back rooms, taking inventory out of that. I think that's been a
big push of Greg's because he believes if the back rooms are really well organized
then the shrink goes down.
Shrink was an issue that I think hit us at one of the quarters last year. Where are we in
that process? Are all the back rooms clean like you want them?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
No. They are not all clean the way I want them but we're making good progress. And
there's a lot -- there's a couple of diﬀerent things happening there. One, a clean
back room is two things: it's how you ﬂow product into the store and then ultimately
what are the back room processes you run and the ﬂoor processes you run to get it
out.
So a lot of changes going on in ﬂow. But what I talk about is in the store, we have a
new process that we call CAP or rolling out top stock which as you can see is the top
shelves above where we can put product. Our buyers, some of them I have here with
me today, are working on pack and a half compliance in our stores so more product
ﬁts on the shelf.
So our back rooms are I would say signiﬁcantly better and I've been in some back
rooms that are almost completely clean at this point. But not every back room across
the franchise is that way. We're making meaningful progress but more work to do
but I'm encouraged.
Ultimately when we run a clean back room what it really means is we're better in
stock and are in-stock is better and when our in-stock is better we sell more, comps
improve. So we're very focused ultimately on in-stock for the customers and we run a
tight, eﬃcient backroom process, it allows us to stay in stock on the ﬂoor.

Thank you very much. We will continue at the breakout.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-08
