All right. Good morning. My name is Steve Smigie. I'm the semiconductor analyst
here at Raymond James.
It is our pleasure to have NVIDIA presenting for us this morning. We have Colette
Kress, who is the Chief Financial Oﬃcer of NVIDIA. Welcome.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thank you.
{BIO 5514423 <GO>}
So let's just start with a high-level strategy question. You were talking a few seconds
ago, you made some I think important strategic decisions on focus a few years ago
and the rewards have been pretty good. So I was hoping you would talk us through
a little bit where were you guys three years ago and how did we get here and what's
coming after that?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay, let me see if I can do a ﬁrst kind of overview a little bit about NVIDIA. Not
necessarily going all be way back 20 years. But really what the last ﬁve years have
been and where we stand today.
So keep in mind NVIDIA's business model is focused on four market segments that
we participate in. The ﬁrst one that we participate in is our gaming business. Our
gaming business has been with us for since the beginning of time where we focused
on creating the best high-end graphics that we can for an overall PC platform.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 2 of 11Steve Smigie
Colette KressAdditionally, we also have our pro visualization business. Pro visualization is
essentially taking those high-end graphics to the enterprises and to very key
workloads in terms of design, product design and building where those graphics are
very key and important, as well.
Thirdly is our data center business. Quite a bit of focus on that most recently. Our
data center business takes a little bit of a diﬀerent focus not necessarily on graphics
but really talking about the GPU as a center function of overall compute and doing
accelerated computing and in the most recent right now working on AI and deep
learning to be key functions and workloads stemming out of the data center.
Our fourth business is our automotive. Our automotive business is a combination of
both our infotainment platforms that provide high-end graphics to the center
console or the digital dashboard but also a signiﬁcant amount of work on the future
of autonomous driving. And using our AI platform, the very similar AI platform that
you see within the data center. And using that to build autonomous cars moving
forward.
Each of these four businesses has one thing in common, that it has actually the exact
same technology underneath it. We have a uniﬁed platform approach that using the
GPU across all four of those diﬀerent segments is where we start. That is the basis of
our Company, we built the GPU and invented the GPU some time ago but now
we've continued to advance that, over the last three years focusing on the platform
approach.
Moving away from looking at our business in terms of components or component
inside of a PC or component inside of a server but looking at it as a full end-to-end
system or solution that focuses not only on that strength of the hardware and its
performance but the overall development platform, the development language, the
overall tools and libraries in order to use that for the individual workloads. So that
strategic approach has allowed us to move into these extremely diﬃcult and
challenging problems as that's the center of what we like to focus on. Areas where
not easy to solve and focusing on artiﬁcial intelligence, deep learning as well as
autonomous cars have been so helpful to us in terms of creating our strategy going
forward.
{BIO 5514423 <GO>}
That's great. Thank you.
So within those major areas that you outlined I was hoping you would talk a little bit
about how we should be thinking about growth in each of those. Because it seems
some of them are hyper growth and gaming seems very solid and growing much
faster than I would've anticipated but maybe not the same rate for various reasons as
the other businesses. So any color on growth would be great.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 11Yes. So each of our businesses, each of those four businesses are deﬁnitely in
diﬀerent stages of maturity rather than actually saying diﬀerent stages of growth. If
you think about our overall gaming business, the gaming business for at least the
last ﬁve years type of CAGR has grown about 30% and in this last year even grew
stronger than 30%. But what you are seeing there is a continuation of the importance
of gaming moving from just a situation where the gamers are actually playing with
their PC back but actually playing as a social experience.
It is becoming a social platform that you are there with a multitude of friends. You are
playing online, your friends are there with you.
But then there has also been the evolution of eSports. eSports really is a spectator
type of sport. So essentially just watching others again, learning better how to play
by watching videos of others games has become a key part of gaming.
So it is essentially gaming as a sport is mature. The business has deﬁnitely grown
faster than the underlying growth. But that is probably multiple factors associated
with the better games that have been coming out, the social platform but also us
growing the overall gaming market or the overall TAM that we can address with our
overall platform.
When we moved to pro visualization, that business has been a very mature business
where we have a leading position as our GPUs are considered to be best-of-breed.
Best-of-breed in terms of any type of product design or any other building design
that you may want to do or anything that you may want to do in the ﬁlm industry in
terms of special eﬀects. That has tended to be something that has grown in line with
maybe a GDP or in line with average enterprises.
Because they are going hand-in-hand we are solving many of those enterprise
graphic problems that we see. This last year, though, we had a very, very strong year
of it growing about 11%. And that growth was largely due to the moving of higher
performance and mobile types of applications and workstations for you to use your
graphic cards with them.
Moving to data center, hard to say in terms of where it is. We've seen tremendous
growth in our overall data center business. Our data center business for the last
three years, let's call it about a 50% growth rate. But in this last year it grew 145% and
in Q4 it tripled.
So it is on a very strong trajectory where we have really honed in on some of the
most challenging problems that are out there in areas of artiﬁcial intelligence and
deep learning training, which is one of the key frameworks to solve some of those
problems and we are at the forefront. Both the forefront in terms of the GPU being
extremely well-positioned in terms of its performance and capabilities. But also the
strength of our overall development platform and software solutions that we are
working to teach many of the diﬀerent places around the world to use. And weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 11Steve Smigie
Colette Kresscontinue to probably consider ourselves to be in the ﬁrst innings of our data center
business as we move forward.
So that leaves us our last one in terms of automotive. Two diﬀerent pieces in there.
You have our automotive business for infotainment systems that's rather a mature
space.
Most of the cars that you see today incorporate infotainment systems at diﬀerent
degrees. We partake in the premium levels where that key graphics diﬀerentiates it
within the car. And we have well penetrated many of those high-end cars as we see
now and has had very strong growth rates as we've continued to grow that.
As we move forward, though, that business will change or transform as we focus on
autonomous driving. And focusing there currently on the road we have one of the
very ﬁrst level 3 autonomous driving vehicles on the road with Tesla. We have
continued to announce at our CES just a couple of months ago in terms of our
continued work with Audi and Daimler also working on their autonomous platforms
going forward.
But we are still in the early stages of that as we know that the automotive industry
has some time in terms of getting those actual designs. But I think you will see them
soon. And you have even most of the car companies focusing on 2020 is the year in
terms of a lot of those platforms coming forth. So agreed, all in diﬀerent stages, all in
diﬀerent types of growth rates but all very, very important businesses to us.
{BIO 5514423 <GO>}
That's great. Just to go to gaming because that was the heritage or still very strong,
can you talk about how that's changed? It seemed to be very tied to the PC
historically. But now I don't know if it's driven maybe more by when you launch a
platform. So how has that changed in terms of how you generate revenue oﬀ that
business versus traditionally?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. If you actually think about this a couple of years ago, three, four, ﬁve years ago, it
was very common to talk about what is the overall PC market going to grow in order
to try and determine what our overall gaming business revenue would be. But the
reality is that's not actually how this gaming market works. Most of our gamers today
and gamers that are coming on board usually already have a PC. And this business is
about an add-in card market or adding in the underlying platform to improve your
overall performance.
We sell most of the time an add-in card and we are not actually selling a true PC. So
that evolving business has really been where we have concentrated on that platform
in terms of the sale.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 11Steve Smigie
Colette KressBut some other evolutions of what has happened over the last couple of years. One
of them is really the mobility, the mobility of the gamers. The gamers love their high-
end cards that gives them the best type of performance with the AAA production
value games that are also coming out. But they also want that mobility to be able to
essentially game anywhere.
So we have taken in this last year the exact same performance that you can get in a
desktop to a mobile laptop performance. And now you are seeing a market really
high performing overall notebooks, those that maybe in the $2,000, $2,500 price
range for an overall laptop that enable you to have that high-end gaming, as well.
And that market is actually growing very strong and growing stronger than our
overall desktop business.
But you are continuing to see the move in terms of mobility, the ability moving also
to the cloud. You have seen us at CES talk about our GeForce NOW experience
where we will actually be working on streaming down games to whatever diﬀerent
types of device, a device that right now might not be enabled with a high-end GPU.
And they will be leveraging the GPU in the cloud so that we can bring high-end
gaming to essentially any gamer or any PC whether or not it already has a high-end
GPU involved.
So these are some of the key areas in the evolution that we have seen. When you see
gamers coming into renew or refresh what they have been using in terms of the GPU
they are essentially coming in and buying some of our greatest platforms as that
performance that improves their overall experience even though it may be the exact
same game that they have been playing for a year is key to them. So the overall price
to performance continues to improve.
You even saw us with that last week. Last week we launched yet another graphics
card, our 1080 Ti, in the high-end part of the market which now even allows 35%
more performance versus our last highest card, the 1080, that is out there.
{BIO 5514423 <GO>}
And not just for the gaming market but one area that that seems very interesting is
virtual reality. I have to say at a recent Analyst Day I got to try, I think you call it VR
Funhouse, is that the -- and it made me a believer. I tried 3D TVs in the past -- God,
this is awful, I don't know if I really believe in VR.
But I tried your system there, it was on two 1080 cards. And it was phenomenal. So
can talk a little bit about the PR opportunity there and how you guys look at that at
this point?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Absolutely. So virtual reality is deﬁnitely coming to life and has over this last year.
Virtual reality, one of the key things to make it a successful experience is the
performance power of a high-end GPU.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 11Steve Smigie
Colette KressIf you want to do the high-end virtual reality, the ones that make it look tremendously
realistic, that needs that processing power or the overall frame rate refresh that a
GPU can overall provide. We have come out with Funhouse, Funhouse is our own
game, to talk about the content and content capabilities that will continue to evolve
over this space. Right now we have enabled almost every single one of our gaming
cards in the gaming side of our house to all be eligible or equally capable of running
that VR as we think this is an important next generation of high-end gaming.
Gaming where you come into the game not necessarily in one position but you can
observe the game from any other type of position within that game. You can think
about new evolutions in terms of the strategy within a game if we are talking about
the virtual reality.
The content is also continuing to build. There is a tremendous amount of both
startups as well as traditional gaming companies that are focused on building out
that content.
So we are in the early stages of it. But just with everything it's a continuous play of
additional hardware. The hardware is there to now endorse it, the content will
continue to evolve, as well.
{BIO 5514423 <GO>}
Great. I just wanted to turn to the data center. As you mentioned, last quarter was
pretty amazing.
One area that I've found to be getting a lot of attention is artiﬁcial intelligence. And
so I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you enable that. But just
generally to drill down a little bit more to NVIDIA. And how into NVIDIA's data center
market and how you see that segmenting out.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So when you think about our data center business, our data center business is
actually ﬁve individual businesses underneath it.
So let me start with some of those pieces. We have been in the data center business
for more than 8 to 10 years but where we started and which is still a key component
of our business is high-performance computing. High-performance computing using
a GPU as an accelerator in many of the high-end supercomputers across the world,
supercomputers that are focused on high-end mathematical computations
essentially where the answer is known but using a GPU as an accelerator taking work
oﬀ the CPU enables the overall workload to be enhanced and complete sooner.
We are still in that business. It is still thriving, it is still growing very well within our
business. But now that has expanded uniquely into other areas of our data center
business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 11Number two, we have been focusing on the work in terms of with hyperscale
companies, companies like the Microsofts, the Amazons, the Googles, the Baidus,
the Facebooks, where they are focusing on applications that you and I see every
single day and use that are GPU AI accelerated. What we mean by this is think about,
for example, areas of voice recognition, natural language processing, image
detection, video encoding, things that are now AI enabled where throwing a
signiﬁcant amount of data together with the deep neural network surrounding it
allows to serve back and answer at a lickety-split answer using artiﬁcial intelligence.
A common example of that would be search. Voice search on your phone which is
now becoming a signiﬁcant percentage of the search commands that happen is
essentially an AI problem and those are generally being used with the GPU behind.
So that's business number two.
Business number three is a focus in terms of on the cloud. So when you think about
the hyperscales in some cases or when they actually move to a cloud service
provider, one of the number one instances that is being asked for is an instance in
the cloud that is also with the GPU. So the cloud service providers are building out
instances for enterprises, startups, researchers to use a cloud to access a GPU in a
rent type of model and to begin their work on bigger workloads.
All diﬀerent types of problems facing the enterprises or the startups. And you see
many of their work focused on large data sets and creating those neural networks in
terms of in the cloud. They also are doing high-performance computing in the cloud
and they also may be working in terms of virtualized GPU which essentially moves us
to our fourth business.
Our fourth business is our GRID business. Our great businesses focuses on a one-to-
many model of one GPU to many users. Essentially that GPU sits in the cloud and
either streams down graphic-intensive information, essentially can carry the overall
workstation as a whole up into the cloud, virtualize the application, virtualize the PC
or some of the other things that we are seeing in that business.
Then our last business is our DGX AI supercomputers. Similar to the cloud and the
desire to get started in AI in terms of the enterprises, a way to actually get to the
enterprises quickly is providing them a containerized AI supercomputer versus a
one-to-one TOEFL platform that we build. This is a case where the supercomputer
comes with 8 GPUs installed and also comes, which is the most signiﬁcant portion, is
the software.
The software that includes our CUDA development platform but also supports all of
the diﬀerent AI frameworks that are out there and the overall development libraries
and components for them to start right oﬀ the bat in terms of with their DGX. It is
essentially just a plug-in and begin a lot of that AI work.
So those are our ﬁve businesses. All of them extremely important and strongly
growing across. But it's a combination of focusing on the cloud with the hyperscalesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-06

Page 8 of 11Steve Smigie
Colette Kressas far as the outreach that we also are doing with higher education, enterprises and
many of the diﬀerent industries focused on AI.
{BIO 5514423 <GO>}
Great. Thanks. Just as a follow-up to that, we had an artiﬁcial intelligence panel at our
December tech conference.
And we asked them whose silicon is the most important out there for artiﬁcial
intelligence at this point and why? And they said deﬁnitely NVIDIA from a hardware
perspective and also the fact that they have CUDA is really what makes it work. And I
think that's something you guys started in on maybe 10 years ago. So I was hoping
you would talk a little bit about given that strength what do you think about
incoming competition either maybe from FPGAs or from maybe AMD coming in with
a newer-generation of GPU here?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. I think it's a good area to focus on. It's not necessarily just about the silicon
because if you think about our platform there is so much more that comes with it.
CUDA, for those that are not familiar, is our development programming language
born within the Company eight to 10 years. But the important part is how many that
we teach and have given the knowledge to overall CUDA.
Through these eight to 10 years of teaching it in higher education as well as in self-
taught type of forums to where they are instructor led and certiﬁcations we have now
reached more than 400,000 diﬀerent developers around the world and taught them
on CUDA. CUDA is essentially open. It is also very C++ like.
And what that does is it allows a programmer to not necessarily program at the
hardware level but extract that up at a software level so that they can essentially write
what they want the hardware to the application to do but are essentially writing what
they are familiar with at the software designer level. But that overall outreach they
continue to teach, they continue to provide additional libraries and diﬀerent
components that allows that ease-of-use of the GPU is really the key diﬀerentiation
that we have against any other type of competitor that's out there.
There are many diﬀerent other form factors of what we will refer to as acceleration.
You could move to an FPGA, an ASIC or maybe even another GPU but we need to
understand it is diﬀerent. It's not the same as a GPU.
A GPU's performance capability is very, very high and its overall performance to watt
is also a very important thing to keep in mind there. The downfalls of all the other
ones is the ability to how do you get started, how do you actually do that
programming in AI without that programming language and the amount of work that
we have focused on in terms of the frameworks?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 11Steve Smigie
Colette KressWe keep an eye on every single framework in deep learning and deep learning
training that is out there, TensorFlow Caﬀe to continue to ﬁnd new areas for us to
focus in terms of libraries to help them. But also making sure we understand what is
best-of-breed for what industry to see that type of AI work.
So there is a lot of focus on CUDA and then some. We call it cuDNN, which stands
for deep neural nets. Again, working on how do you develop those neural nets that
are some of the key components underneath deep learning.
We have also expanded our learnings to what we refer to as the Deep Learning
Institute helping people understand what is deep learning, how do you write for
deep learning types of applications. And we are now teaching that around the world.
We started last year in all of our GPU technology conferences. It is one of the most
sold-out types of institute and training that we do. And we will probably in the years
coming forward reach probably hundreds of thousands of people that we have
trained in our deep learning institutes, as well.
{BIO 5514423 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Maybe just one minute on transition within auto.
This has been a more Tegra-based solution moving more to Tegra plus GPU or GPU
as autonomous driving. Maybe a minute on that and a minute on margins because I
want to leave a couple of minutes for questions from the audience.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. Really quickly on our autonomous driving, we usually talk about it after we've
talked about data center. And the reason why is really an extension of some of the
same work that we had learned in the data center regarding deep learning and AI.
Solving the problem of autonomous driving and onlines is a AI problem requiring
signiﬁcant amount of compute to process what was occurring around the car and
determine the steps.
There was nothing in terms of when you and I drove that we learned from an overall
handbook and then got into the car. It is actually from inferring at every situation that
we enable. And the GPU is just, again, well-positioned to take a lot of that work.
So what you see us doing is both a combination of putting the SOCs or Tegra brand
together with our GPUs in autonomous platforms going forward which we call our
DRIVE PX. And that is, again, a customized solution, scalable solution depending on
any level that you want to do in driving.
We have heard level 3, level 4 types there. Level 3 could probably be completed
with an SOC in terms of the car. Keep in mind they have in their data centers of those
automotive companies DGX servers that are also working in terms of our platformFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-06

Colette Kressback in their data center to train the data that will eventually be in the car, as well.
And taking on that work as they drive and realizing new information, their new data
that will be also trained back in terms of those data centers.
But also we can expand that by adding new GPU in those cases, as well, to add
additional more color, additional more complexity the problems that we can solve as
we move from level 3 to level 4 and beyond. So our scope is to continue this work.
You have seen us talk with Tesla, you have also heard us talk about Audi and Daimler
in terms of working on their autonomous driving platforms, as well.
{BIO 5514423 <GO>}
Great. Then you have got a bunch of new businesses. And so can you talk to us a
little bit about how we should think about say margin proﬁles going forward based
on all the new stuﬀ coming in?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Some margins whether or not we start with our overall gross margins, kind of
our focus of the underlying parts of our business when we think about the hardware.
Most of our business platforms now are really rich in terms of the software layer
allowing us to provide an increasing amount of value that we deliver in terms of the
products that we do.
Higher value allows us the ability to grow our overall margins from a gross margin
perspective as we focus on the development layer in terms of with our R&D on the
software. So if we continue to expand to these higher-end value platforms we do
have the opportunity to increase our overall gross margins.
We have a little bit of a change this quarter as we renew our overall Intel licensing
royalty agreement and move forward from that. But again, our focus is still going to
be moving on expanding to the higher value added platforms and growing overall
gross margins.
{BIO 5514423 <GO>}
Great. We will see if there is a question in the audience. Okay. Great.
So I will just follow on with what you will do going forward with your capital. You
have done a great job increasing margins, getting a lot of growth. What do you do
with all that cash now? You seem to be very good at doing stuﬀ with what you have
already got. But is there anything out there that makes sense for you to go buy?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So when we think about the cash that we have generated from the Company, the
number one focus is going to be making sure we have invested that appropriately inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-06

Page 11 of 11Steve Smigie
Colette Kressterms of into our business going forward. Our investments in there is very key.
Investment in growing many of the markets that we just talked about.
There can be from time to time areas that we believe bolting on teams, early growth
areas onto these platforms is a key focus of us, as well. Or another way of saying it,
we rarely just purchase people one by one to start. In terms of our teams we may
buy teams of people in the early startup.
So we will always keep looking for that but we have been a Company that has largely
been organic with some of those smaller pieces added on. Those are going to be
our two key focuses that we use in terms of our cash ﬁrst. And then we focus in terms
of our capital return process. Our capital return is very important to our shareholder
value message. And that is a long-standing part of our business and will be as we go
forward.
{BIO 5514423 <GO>}
Great, well thanks a lot. We appreciate that.
Breakout session will be in Cordoba 3. Thank you.
