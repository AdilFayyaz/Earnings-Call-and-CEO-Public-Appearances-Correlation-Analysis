Pleased to have with us today from lululemon, Stuart Haselden, COO; and PJ Guido,
CFO.
With a limited number of highly productive stores across the globe generating sales
of roughly $1,550 per square foot, a rapidly growing e-commerce business and
nearly 100% proprietary products, we believe lululemon is a retailer built for the 21st
century with full control over its product line and little potential disintermediation
from channel disruption.
This control over its own destiny is apparent in management's 5-year plan to double
revenue and more than double earnings by 2020 as well as its phenomenal sales
momentum. For those of you who weren't paying attention, they just comped 19% in
the First Quarter.
There will be a video. And then, Stuart will come up to the podium. But before the
video plays, I need to tell you, there is a complete list of research disclosures and
potential conﬂicts of interest at williamblair.com.

Okay. Thank you, Sharon. It's good to be here. All right, now ready. And it's good to
be here, in particular, with our new CFO, PJ Guido. So you'll hear from PJ here in a
few minutes. But I thought we'd start with just a discussion of our strategies. And an
update on the progress we've made in the First Quarter. So forward-looking
statement, nice job, Howard.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-13

Page 2 of 62020 vision. So in the beginning of 2016, we set out a bold plan, as Sharon
mentioned, to double our revenues and more than double our earnings. So we're
very pleased with the progress we made against that plan. You see here listed the 4
primary growth drivers that are helping us achieve the trajectory that we'll deliver,
about $4 billion in revenue. While there is still a lot of work to be done across these
areas, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making in each of them.
I'm going to drill into each of these areas a little bit today. Starting with North
America. Very strong First Quarter, 6% store comp in the quarter, really driven by
strong store traﬃc. We've seen an accelerating trend in store traﬃc over the last
several quarters. This is the Second Quarter where we had positive store traﬃc
overall. And we're excited to see this trend continuing into the Second Quarter and
even accelerating.
So this is, I think, a reﬂection of the health of our business and our guest
engagement strategies in general. And again, really pleased with the success we're
seeing here.
As we step back from just the results in the First Quarter and look more broadly at
our store strategy in North America, really happy and really inspired by the
innovation that our North American team has delivered. And so we now have a
number of store formats that didn't exist several years ago. And so the co-located
format that you heard us talk about, if you follow the company, is an important
growth driver for square footage in our most productive stores.
We've also had success with a small format concept that we call the local, that is
enabling us to enter markets that we wouldn't otherwise look to open our normal
format store. And most recently, the exciting innovation with regard to our seasonal
store. So we opened 24 seasonal stores in the Fourth Quarter. They accounted for
$20 million of revenue in the Fourth Quarter. We kept 9 of them open into the First
Quarter based on the strength in their performance and we're looking to convert
those now to permanent stores. So a great new way that the team has developed to
derisk market entry and capture demand that we otherwise wouldn't. So really
pleased with the trajectory and the punchline on those. The innovation is that we're
able to now extend the square footage growth runway in North America for our
store business from where we had contemplated just a few years ago. And that's part
of the double-digit square footage growth outlook that we have for next several
years within our store business. You see here a couple of photos, 2 of our
experiential stores, Queen Street in Toronto and our new store in New York on 5th
Avenue.
There's some exciting innovation the team's also developing in this regard. I would
encourage you the next time you're in Toronto, to visit the Queen Street store. It now
incorporates a community space as well as dedicated studio space. And this is
helping us change the trajectory in a very dramatic way of traﬃc and engagement in
that community as a result of those aspects of the store. So very exciting.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-13

Page 3 of 6Digital. So this has been a big part of the story over the last few quarters, going back
to last year. So First Quarter, we posted a 60% increase in digital sales, really driven
by strong traﬃc and conversion. We are having success with our digital marketing
eﬀorts in driving higher levels of engagement and traﬃc to our site. And as the
guests are arriving at our site, they're having a better experience. And we're
converting at a higher rate.
This is -- this reﬂects also the -- all the work that went on last year into the -- into
improving the website that culminated in the relaunch of the website at the end of
the Third Quarter. We saw the 40% comp in the Fourth Quarter accelerate into the
First Quarter, as you see here. The work is not done. There are still a number of
things that we're working on for this year. The 3 that you see listed here, checkout,
search and personalization, are areas that we're working on, driving further
improvements in conversion this year. We will have our eﬀorts in these areas
completed largely by the Third Quarter of this year.
So moving on to men. So this has been an exciting part of the product story. It's --
we've seen a higher growth rate in men's. We have set a target for 2020 to have a $1
billion men's business. And we're pleased to be ahead of schedule in achieving that
level of growth. The men's business is a deep opportunity strategically for us to grow
our business. I'm very happy with the performance and the progress we made in the
First Quarter. A few stats you see here, or a few headlines. 26% growth in men's
comp in the First Quarter. And it really came in a very balanced way across the entire
portfolio. So we saw double-digit comp increases in every major category within
men's.
You see a couple of the major -- the hits, if you will, from a products standpoint,
listed. I would add to this, our ABC franchise continues to perform really well and be
an important entry point for a lot of new guests.
The -- this -- the new styles that we introduced last year in the Third Quarter continue
to perform well. We won't comp those -- that introduction of those new styles until
later in the Third Quarter this year.
The -- I would say, also a headline for us, as we look into the second half of the year,
is outerwear. We're very excited about new styles, broader assortment, solving new
functional problems from an outerwear standpoint. So that will be something to
watch for.
We've also had a big focus within men's on just driving awareness and
consideration. We still see our men's business as a bit of a secret, broadly speaking,
with our guests -- with our target guests. So we've had a big focus on driving
increased levels of engagement and leveraging new strategies from a brand
marketing standpoint. You see here a couple of screenshots from a ﬁlm that we did
with Mark Healey, one of our Elite ambassadors. This was particularly successful in
the First Quarter. We had over 5.3 million views of this ﬁlm across our social mediaFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-13

Page 4 of 6outlets against the plan of 4 million. So again, just an example of how we're
innovating our business model.
International. So really exciting to see the growth, both in Asia and Europe. As I
mentioned on our earnings call, if you'd listened to that, while we're excited about
the growth in our international markets. This is an area that will likely take us a little
bit longer to achieve the original goals that we've put out for 2020. Nonetheless,
we're seeing very robust growth, particularly in Asia. You see a couple of stats listed
here for the First Quarter, 53% overall international growth and over 100% growth in
China -- I'm sorry, in Asia and the -- with the majority of the growth, as we look
forward, in Asia coming from China.
So while we're excited about international and we're seeing very exciting growth
rates in Asia, we're still pleased with the progress that we're making in Europe, even
though slower than the original schedule that we had drawn up. We did comment
on the call that we saw double-digit comps in Europe in the First Quarter ahead of
budget. And so that's just another indication of the health of that business and the
progress that we're making to take it forward. So look forward to seeing that
momentum continue into the balance of the year.
Then ﬁnally, supply chain. This has been a big enabler for our business over the last
three years, as we emerge from some of the problems that we had a few years ago.
We now have a much more stable infrastructure on which to grow our business
globally. These were important investments that we made, that not only enabled our
growth. But also enabled the margin recovery -- the product margin recovery
speciﬁcally that we have seen and continue to enjoy. As we have accomplished a lot
with our supply chain, the next chapters of that story will focus on speed and
improving the ﬂexibility within our supply chain to deliver goods faster to market. So
that -- there's a number of strategies that we're pursuing now to -- along those lines
and those goals that we'll talk more about in the coming quarters.
Segmented supply chain is really the essence of how we have been able to drive
eﬃciencies in our cost structure. So there you'll see continued success in driving
down AUCs and product margin improvements as we've talked about into the future.
Connected to both of those is a new partnership with Mas, one of our largest and
most important suppliers from Sri Lanka, Mas have built a factory in Haiti, that now
produces a meaningful amount of our seamless styles. And so that does a number of
things for us in terms of shortening shipping times as well as improving our cost
structure. So that's an important innovation, if you will, in the footprint -- the
geographic footprint of our production network.
Then lastly, from a -- further down the supply chain into our distribution network in
North America, we have an exciting project that we've launched to improve delivery
times and cost, primarily for our e-commerce business. We'll be building a new DC
in the Toronto area that will help us achieve those improvements for our East Coast
guests. And that will be beneﬁts that we'll begin to realize into next year and the
following years. So those are just some of the headlines of the progress that we
made against our key strategies so far in 2018. We're excited in terms of what's inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-13

achieving the goals that we've spoken about and moving beyond that.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to PJ to take us through some of the ﬁnancial
headlines of the quarter.
{BIO 20577804 <GO>}
All right. Thank you, Stuart. So I'd like to start by doing a quick ﬁnancial diagnostic on
the health of the lulu brand. For all (inaudible), if we're going to promote healthy
lifestyle for our guests, we should be promoting and protecting the health of our
own brand.
So these are -- look at these key ﬁnancial metrics. These are metrics that you all track.
It really supports the case for lulu as one of the healthier and stronger brands in
retail today.
So Stuart mentioned the comp, 19%. I'd like to just quickly drill into the deep -- the
brick-and-mortar comp of 6%. So our stores are our window to the world and still
represent 75% of our revenue. So the fact that we did a 6% comp shows that our
guests are willing to bypass convenience in order to physically interact with the
brand. And that's meaningful. And as you know, our approach is based on
community, where our guest educators, our ambassadors, our guests are all
interconnected in the community. And it's a hard thing to replicate and something
that we view as a competitive advantage.
So in regards to traﬃc, we see a brand that is inviting and relevant. In regards to
conversion and new guest acquisition, that tells us that we are true to our mission of
solving problems for our guests. And we also have very low return rates, which,
again, speaks to the quality of the product and us, again, giving our guests what they
want.
Lastly, I'll -- I would just focus on the gross margin, which is a great story. On both
sides of the gross margin, on one hand, we are improving -- we -- our mix is
favorable, which drives up the gross margin. But also lower markdowns are driving
an improvement in gross margin.
On the other side of gross margin, we are seeing leverage on ﬁxed costs but as well
as product cost. So I'll just quickly go through this.
The top line was up 25% in Q1. We improved the gross margin by 270 basis points.
The SG&A rate was leveraged by 130 basis points.
Operating margin plus 400 basis points. And EPS up 72% at $0.55. So strong results
there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-13

Page 6 of 6As the new CFO, I've got to be honest. It's comforting to know that we have a very
strong ﬁnancial position. We have -- with operating margins approaching 20% and
cash ﬂow surpassing $0.5 billion, we have the ﬁnancial resources to support our
pillars of growth that Stuart talked about.
Our inventory is well balanced. We're very low-aged inventory with the right mix of
core and seasonal product to meet robust demands. We have minimal debt on the
balance sheet, which gives us additional ﬁnancial resources and access to capital. As
the retail consumer evolves, we need to evolve with the consumer. And many
retailers will be faced with buy versus build versus partner decisions over the coming
years. And it's comforting to know that we have the resources to evaluate and
engage on all of those things.
And lastly, I would just mention that we are active. For right now, we do ﬁnd
ourselves in a position where we have excess cash. And we are actively returning it
to shareholders. We recently upped our share authorization to $600 million. One of
our largest shareholders, Advent, did monetize part of their position. We
participated in that trade, repurchasing $400 million of stock or 3.3 million shares. So
we are -- and we still have a remaining $200 million of authorization there.
So I'll close by just reiterating our guidance. We're calling for high single-digit comps
in Q2, EPS of $0.46 or $0.48. And for the year, again, high single-digit comps with
$3.10 to $3.18 EPS. This does not include the recent share repurchase, which we
forecast to be approximately $0.03 accretive as well for the year.
And with that, thank you for attending. And we appreciate your interest in the lulu
brand.
