Presentation
We were just saying, it's very rare to have two women on stage at the same time. So
thank you. We're very pleased to have Julia White with us, today, from Microsoft. Her
bio is very long and distinguished. And some of you might have seen her do the big
-- I think it was Satya's ﬁrst public appearance, where you demoed Oﬃce for iPad,
right? And you were the one in control of that session, I remember it well.
But anyhow, like I mentioned, she has a very long and distinguished career. She's
Corporate Vice President at Microsoft. She heads up Marketing and Product
Management for Azure and the security portfolio. She's doing double time between
here and RSA. So if you've got security questions, she can probably ﬁeld some of
those as well.
But before we get started, also, I'm going to read the disclosure statement from an
exact copy. Before we begin, Microsoft may make some forward-looking comments
during this presentation. And you should refer to their SEC ﬁlings for the risk factors
relating to their business and this was interesting. And that depends on whether you
are here in person or listening on the web. So that was a mutual disclosure.
So thank you. It's great to see so many familiar faces in the audience. Again, we're
happy to have Julia with us today. We're going to try and make this as interactive as
possible. So feel free to raise your hand if you have a question. But to start out, just
for level-set people in the room, how do you deﬁne cloud for the audience?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Right, cloud is a big thing. So for Microsoft, speciﬁcally, we have a very broad
deﬁnition of cloud and cloud assets, frankly. So just to kind of give you a preview of
that, starting with our productivity cloud with Oﬃce 365, it's everything from the
actual Oﬃce applications being delivered as a live service, as well as e-mail,
collaboration, Skype, Team, anything that do communication, collaboration and
productivity in our Oﬃce 365 cloud went into our business applications with ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

Julia Whitedynamic 365, the Line of Business, CRM, ﬁeld service, those type of technologies.
And then, of course, our core platform and infrastructure with Azure, we're able to
do app innovation, other things like that and then, our data.
So we have Cortana intelligence, as well as our deep data artiﬁcial intelligence
capabilities. Then, last but not least of course is we actually have a whole cloud
security and management portfolio as well. So for us, cloud is a comprehensive from
productivity, line of business, infrastructure, security and data, all-in-all.
Okay, helpful, thank you. If you look back over, you guys have a diﬀerent ﬁscal, then
calendar. But however you want to think about it, over the last 12 months, what had
been the biggest surprise? What surprised you about your cloud business?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
I think the cloud are technology advancements, as well as the market -- honestly,
have been developing about as expected. So like from a tax disruption, I can't think
about big surprise there. The interesting thing, the biggest I think surprise for all of
us is the political situations going on across the globe. And maybe it's UK, in US, or
pending in Italy and Germany. But it actually had a very material impact on the cloud
conversations we're having with customers in terms of where is data residing or
where are your data centers, how do we think about that, who has access to privacy,
data handling, those conversations are coming up more and more based on, I think,
some of us can consider it as somewhat surprising political situation.
So is that a sign -- if you take away, take a step back in political situation, is that a
sign? Do you think that people -- that cloud has become more mainstream, is that
you're starting to get these questions from more of your customers that might be
removing beyond say, custom dev and that we're actually starting to hear people
think about and plan for these bigger migrations? Is that also potentially what's
behind those types of questions?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
For sure. People are -- I think we're in the phase of -- we're in early cycles of dev/test
and kind of ﬁnding new mobile apps in the cloud. So you're now really thinking
about that holistic data center migration to the cloud where you're looking at
mission-critical application, very sensitive Line of Business data, those core things,
where the topics become more and more central. What's interesting is, Oﬃce 365 is
our most mature commercial cloud oﬀering and in the early days, people like,
obviously, did for archiving and diﬀerent things? And then they started saying, I'm
going to run my entire productivity stack in the cloud. So those questions matured as
well. So I think we're seeing a similar cycle from the infrastructure and then holistic
data center side of it at this point.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

Julia WhiteSo would you say that -- and this is going to sound crazy, because there is speciﬁc
technology that's been around cloud, that's has been around -- AWS started a little
over a decade ago, are we beyond -- I mean, most people's tech companies have
moved today or sheer start-up have started in the cloud. But again, still mainstream
corporations, when we talk to them, there are still people that have a very limited
cloud strategy. Are we at the point now where this is mainstream for everyone, not
just kind of staﬀ basis. But thinking of those production workloads that might be
custom built starting to move?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
I would say, mainstream in the conversation and in the planning. And more and more
average or even the laggard technology organizations are now having a cloud-ﬁrst IT
strategy. But I don't think when you look at mainstream, it's actual cloud adoption
from an infrastructure and platform perspective.
Do you have a sense of how long it takes to move from like being a conversation -- a
mainstream conversation to mainstream deployment?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes, I -- as a technologist, I would want to go a lot faster and I live in my own little
bubble where everything is -- quickly in technology. Having done commercial
enterprise technology for 20 years, it always does slower than the technologists
want. And so, I mean I think we're in the -- I think about this year was the year --
actually, end of 2016 was the year that 50% percentage of mainstream organizations
felt that cloud security was superior to what they are getting on-premises and
50%thought it was inferior.
So we've hit that conversation. So I think if we think ﬁve years forward, then I think
you'll start seeing good mainstream core line of this applications in kind of a broad
adoption, having begun in a real way. But I was trying to temper it too. I mean
people used to tell me EDI was going away. And we know mainframe is still a $2
million business. So let's be practical about this too, in terms of how it's going to go,
how the curve is going to shape.
What's on your customers' wish list, is securities at the top priority on your
customers' wish list and what else would be on their -- if that's not --?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

Julia WhiteYes, security is always -- when you look at things that people care about -- the cloud -
- security then is still number one. It's become less. So we’ve seen privacy rising on
that one. But I think the thing that I talk to customers most about is, as again, as the
mainstream companies who don't do technology for a living or don't knowhow to
use a cloud with digital transformation, it's how do you make the cloud easier. We're
innovating so quickly. All of us are, not just Microsoft, thousand new capabilities
coming out. And so, if you're just -- if you're GE, if you're a manufacturing company
or you're an auto manufacturer, trying to keep up with that is hard and knowing how
to take advantage of that.
So things like, make my transition from data center to cloud will be much smoother.
Don't just assume everything is going to go to the cloud overnight. So there are
deep investments in hybrid. The way we do hybrid very uniquely in having that
continuity between the two, because we deeply understand the data center, as well
as the cloud that is uniquely able to make that something that customers can do in a
way that make sense for them. So I think that migration is certainly top of mind.
Then again, I think it was already a conversation that -- even more so, in a political
domain and really focusing on what we call trust. And under trust we have the
principles of privacy, security, compliance and transparency. We're making sure
we're kind of on an cutting edge in those areas. So they know that even if business
policy or political situations change, they can trust that their cloud is ready for the
full-time business use.
So it's a good segue, given what you said about helping to make the transitions
smoother. But how do you think about the competitive environment for cloud today.
And how you've diﬀerentiated yourself, if you could go a little bit deeper?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes, I think the past couple years have been a bit of a feature war if I look at the
cloud. Those features actually -- they're closing the gap on features. And I think now
we're at a point where we have a feature aided with a feature, whatever. So it's like
feature war. Now, it's about how do people actually get business outcomes from the
cloud. And I think that's the real pivot and talking about -- I mean, our massive sales
force is out every day, talking about digital transformation. That's the conversation
our customers want to have with us, is that digital transformation, not just how do I
use texts [ph]. But how do I get new business outcomes that I can get. So if I think
about holistically, it's the diﬀerentiation question, one, of having a holistic cloud. We
all have Microsoft Cloud, it's not just Azure, not just Oﬃce 365, it is not just our
Dynamics 365, it's all of those things. And so you get coherence of them, a lot of
Oﬃce 365 customers want e-mail running their collaboration stack. I think we've
already done the identity system for you to use [ph] Azure, because we have already
set that up. We've already gone through all the security, audits and type of things at
that front.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

Unidentiﬁed ParticipantHybrid, deﬁnitely a major conversation and a key diﬀerentiator Microsoft has. Again,
we understand the data center and we understand the cloud. What hybrid today --
people use it in diﬀerent ways. But this thing that I have, some of my infrastructure
are in my data center and some of my infrastructure are in the cloud. Basically as an
IT organization you're running two infrastructures, if it's not consistent, right and less
expenses. There's security that comes into play and trying to manage two things
that's complex but that's the reality. It's not like everything just goes to cloud
overnight. And so what we have done very uniquely is, had a consistent hybrid
approach. So we have one directory system, one identity system, whether things
areon-premises or in the cloud.
We have one management security platform, whether things are in our data center
or in the cloud. We're now in the ﬁnal stages of launching our consistent platform
with Azure Stack, which is actually speaking the technology of our public cloud Azure
and putting it in a small instantiation and a customer can put it in their data center.
It’s (inaudible) Azure. But it gives them data center control. So a developer can build
our application using the same CPIs, writing application, they can decide to run it on
Azure Stack in the data center or in Azure in our cloud. And have that consistent
experience.
Now, if they were going to run a SQL Server workload on AWS, they would not -- that
feature wouldn't be available for that. And that product wouldn't be available for
Azure Stack?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Azure Stack, correct, I mean Azure Stack is well, I guess, we could use AWS in Azure
Stacks. But that would be a little silly to be honest.
Right.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
You're not getting the beneﬁts of having that sheer developer experience. But it is a
technology that any customer has access to.
How much of that -- how much of innovations like that, a selling point when you're
going in and talking to these customers who, like you said, are just starting their 10-
year journey, where you could say, look work with us and our selling process could
be 1% encapsulating your on-premise stand. I mean, like -- how do we think about
the selling motion and how these types of new products might help ease someone's
concerned about making the best move to the cloud.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

Yes, absolutely, I mean acknowledging that, this is not, I'll say technology thing. But
actually a major change for organizations. I was recently meeting with all of the CIOs
across diﬀerent government agencies and they asked what's the single reason the
cloud adoption is not faster. And I said, you, all of you and your organizations, that’s
just human. The technology is quite mature at some level. But the change really,
understanding in how do we use the cloud versus just doing the exact same thing
you've been doing in your data center in the cloud, that's not really taking advantage
of the cloud. And there's still deep fear in these organizations over if I go to the
cloud, what does that mean for my job? They're humans, jobs keep coming into play.
So when we can go in and have a conversation that fully recognizes that this is a
change initiative and say, you know what, you can change the way you need or you
can go at whatever pace you want, hence that investment in hybrid.
So leveraging and utilizing the best out of those massive existing data center
infrastructure investments, don't just walk away from them, don't like pull oﬀ the
truck (inaudible) use them. And that's an advantage you have. Then, use the cloud
intelligently in how you innovate there, how you connect them. And if you do it in a
way that we do it, it doesn't mean you're running two diﬀerent environments that's
expensive and creates any security issues. It's a very comfortable process for people
in that way.
When we think of the sales force going in and talking to your large customers, are
they incented one way or another person to -- are they incented diﬀerently to drive
cloud for on-premise business or is it a holistic approach and that it doesn't matter
kind of which bucket it's falling into?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
A couple of things though, as we've shifted to be a cloud business, we have adjusted
the way we incentivize our sales force. It's part of our overall Company change. And
so, in the old days, when we only had on-premises technology, all of our sales
people were paid on licenses. So licenses we got paid. Whether the customer use it,
was their problem and they decided to or not. Our sales people got paid on that.
Now in a cloud though, we have increasingly shifted our sales people about the role
we have dedicated to consumption and the amount they are paid on consumption
versus just the transaction moving up and up and up. So we now have a very, very
signiﬁcant sales force that focus only on getting paid when the customer actually
consumes the cloud service, right, giving value out of it. And you need to. That's the
reality of the cloud service. If customers aren't using it, they can look to leave every
day and we recognize that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

Julia WhiteWhen we think about the incremental revenue opportunities. So then if someone
could take all these acts, if you're running a trading application on SQL Server, you
decide to migrate that over to Azure, how do people think about the incremental
revenue opportunity that could go to Microsoft from migrating over? I am wondering
which way to think about it?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Wethink about it. If I look at an overall shape of IT investment, you're paying for the
physical data center, you're paying for the air conditioning, the energy, very
expensive assets, actually, of all of that. When we have our global scale in 38 data
center regions, more than anyone else on the planet, we have incredible economies
of scale that we can pass on to the customer. So they can say well, we actually get a
bigger share of the wallet in terms of running that end to end.
So is there more beyond the heating, cooling in space that's an incremental upsell as
people move to the cloud?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
I mean the technology is that frankly it weren't possible -- it was just frankly more
pragmatically possible on-premises instantiation, machine learning or artiﬁcial
intelligence as one example of things that you could do on-premises for the amount
of infrastructure it took. You couldn't do double, you couldn't try out an app and
experiment with a massive -- you'd be putting a huge upfront cost if you're going to
do that.
What Uber did, they in three months, loaded new apps for their drivers that does
facial recognitions to make sure that's actually the driver that is. It took them very --
they didn't have any upfront costs, they wrote to our cognitive services with those
facial recognition. And that was now part of their app and went out globally in three
months. So that type of thing, fundamentally, I mean you could try to do it in on-
premises, (multiple speaking).
How does cloud adoption for your customers, typically evolve from their initial used
case? I guess, you mentioned Oﬃce 365 is the biggest of your enterprise cloud
oﬀerings. Is that just software customers typically get their ﬁrst taste of using
Microsoft in the cloud. And then, how does it evolve from there?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
So Oﬃce 365, I mean it's in the SAS market (multiple speakers) and more mature
and a little bit more -- so, then people kind of conceptually understood hosted e-
mail because they have that in their personal life. You'd never -- no one ever handFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

Julia Whitetheir own personal email to refer themselves. So that model was very
understandable for companies to go to and e-mail, while mission-critical at some
level, it was something like it's all they could go to. So from a market reason, as well
as the fact that Oﬃce 365, we started many, many years ago, that conﬂuence doesn't
play, for most customers tend to begin their cloud journey.
I think as I look -- and then, once you've done that and you set up your directory
system. And then, you wake up, I've done that, why don't I just do that. And so, there
is deﬁnitely that ﬂow, very common. But increasingly, now with the maturity of the
cloud and where we are, I think both opportunities supplied as if rivals [ph] in terms
of kind of the on-road industry-using [ph] using cloud in a mainstream way.
And how is past adoption evolving, right? People start with IS, how would you say
your momentum in the past adoption is?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes, I think that's two-way, most people because it's what they are familiar with, right.
Our advanced services in Azure, our ad services are going to (technical diﬃculty) so
we're seeing very strong growth of that. And I think that, that will continue. I mean
there are more -- (technical diﬃculty) growth is faster. But I think that when people
see things like I described with Uber of having that facial recognition instantly added
to an app. And services are at higher level services or advanced services that create
that -- to think you couldn't do on your own data center, you will start to recognize
those.
Let me pause for a second and see. I've got a whole host of questions. But I want to
see if there's any from the audience.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
I'll get a new mic, while you're at it.
No, I think all mic’s are good. All right, I'm going to keep going with these. And if
anyone has a question, just feel free to jump in. If you look at ﬁve years from now, 10
years from now and when you said your technologists, you want this to happen
faster than maybe it could, what percentage of workloads would you get, would be
in the cloud, not on Microsoft view, just your view as a technologist?

Unidentiﬁed ParticipantFive or ten years, you can ﬁx the timeframe. Those will be diﬀerent, I hope so.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes, no kidding. We're feeling kind of -- I think depending on which research report
you look at, low-single digits getting into double digits today. And I think in ﬁve
years, we're eclipsing 30% and I think we will double that in the end. But I think it will
be actually more of a linear curve versus a steeper, I mean I think -- part of it is as I
set back the camera and it's too big, right, at $1.6 trillion as we think about everything
that has logged on it. So we have to be a little thoughtful in terms of how big that
cam is. But I think it's going to be -- it will be jumped oﬀ. But I think it's going to be a
massive amount for you on that front.
So you mentioned you have more availabilities on data center space, maybe not
space -- but regions that you're covering, it's been yours than anybody else. How do
we think about -- given these data centers also serve Oﬃce 365 right where you are
serving the globe with this product, how do you think about utilization versus your
competitors? What's your utilization then given all the regions that you have to cover
just given the breadth of the products that you're oﬀering? Are you -- is it taking you
longer to get to the utilization levels that you would like to see inside the data
centers or how should we think about it?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
We do have more reasons than anyone else and we've done that, put data sensors in
countries where people have data. You need to have handling and things that
matter. From a supply chain perspective, we've got incredibly tight on from where
we get signal to the point where we're actually in production on that center or
expansion of one. One of the Microsoft has is, we're one of the largest sales force on
the planet. And so we have a vast number of last-mile signals knowing exactly what
the pipeline looks like, what kind of capacity we need to build from a pretty early
part of the pipeline. So we can get a pretty good sense of that. And we've done a
massive amount of work and we've not given up for a decade. But with our
consumer services and other things, the number of weeks between signal and
production is pretty high. So I don't think that there is (multiple speakers).
So that brings up another question that (inaudible) it's just there are people that
believe that Microsoft can't operate at the scale of AWS because of the way your IS
and casts were designed. So I don't know whether that's myth, or whether it's reality,
because that's certainly something that gets discussed in the investment community.
I was just wondering if you could share any high-level thoughts with that belief?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

The idea that myself, Satya and Phil had, we had this absoluteness, 100% in terms of -
- I think about Skype, Oﬃce 365, our consumer services and the scale that we have
there from a global but also just an overall capacity perspective. And the ads are
powering a vast majority of that underneath. And this year we have with -- I don't
think there is -- I know nothing from a technology perspective that would suggest
that we can scale in. I think many places that I believe will cost to Microsoft have had
much more scalable than EWS does.
Oka, any questions, before I keep going on? Quiet, shy group today, which is
unusual, that's because you're doing a great job. It used to be that CIOs sort of AWS
have still place to take existing Windows deployments and run them. Have seen that
-- given the tremendous growth you've seen in Azure, have you seen that shift where
what used to be, hey, I'm going to take Windows and run it on AWS, has that started
to shift where you would always start with your cloud, if it was an existing Windows
workload versus maybe three or four years ago?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes, I think if I look at our run rate, we get a disproportionate share of the Windows-
based technologies, which shouldn't --
But has that share been increasing over the last few years?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
It has been strong and consistently strong, I would say. And I've just mapped on
whether it's gotten better, I don't know. But it's deﬁnitely strong and continuing.
Then. But at the same time, see I want to clear, I think there is a myth around Azure
doesn't solve Linux workloads and Open Source workloads. Right now, sort of RBMs
are Linux-based. And that is growing. And so, I think people have really started to
hear and take heed and really believe our investments in Open Source. And with the
technology truth in terms of how well we run Open Source, the partnerships we
struck with Red Hat, as an example, we uniquely have a partnership of Red Hat to do
Tier 1 support for our joint customers, no one else has that, diﬀerent things like our
investments in containers, which is kind of the next generation application model
with many Open Source leaders in that world.
And actually, Microsoft is now, I mean, recent reports on GitHub, the number one
contributor to Open Source projects ahead of Google, ahead of Facebook. And so,
not just in an Azure support around Open Source. But also Microsoft overall
commitment and contribution to Open Source is helping set people's minds around
a place of Open Source support as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

Julia WhiteHow about -- so the start-up committee has typically been bought up as building ﬁrst
on AWS. Over the last few years, even the last 12 months. But this do not change
when you see companies building their business on Azure. Do you think that's an
area where there needs to be a bigger focus for the Company? So is there anything
you can share with us there?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes, I mean from Microsoft Investment, we've done a lot around working with
incubators like -- commentator across the globe. And coming out of commentator in
the blast cohorts, we're seeing half of those start-ups using Azure. And half of those
using AWS, which is an increase from past before we understand those programs
and get.com, a great example with the Step Up My Walmart, startup your cloud
100% based on Azure. And so, we are seeing some nice start-up wins on that front. I
think that's always been the place where AWS has started. AWS is technology-
oriented and sort of -- technology-oriented thing. So it makes sense that early on,
that was where got ﬁrst on base run. But I think we're seeing and we're making a
good sense on that.
The VAR community, what are you -- this is kind of the whole cloud thing has kind of
changed their business model a ton, what are you doing to help them continue to
have -- I mean they have a lot of inﬂuence with customers, what do you do to help
them continue to have that same level of inﬂuence? What type of investments or
changes have you made in terms of how you support them?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. We made the same conversation with our partner ecosystem. It has been no less
and sometimes more than our customers in terms of what it means for them. So
eight years ago, we started workshops with our partners, what does it means to
become a service provider versus the service implementer. And what does that
mean from a P&L perspective. And how do you make money. The thing that we've
always been a partner of that company, 90% of our commercial revenue goes for the
partners. That's not changing in terms of where we went with a very partner front
model with our cloud to be able to call it cloud service provider program.
Essentially, if you are a reseller of licenses. And then, maybe there's an
implementation afterwards, you now can do that equivalent thing in the cloud. We
do ask them, they have to add value-added services on top of it versus just to be a
transactor. This is a cloud services world. And so, the expectations we are having of
our ecosystem are diﬀerent. But we're giving them a very understandable, clear way
to make ongoing revenues from our cloud services. And then, build new businesses
on top of that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

Julia WhiteThat's a place we will continue to invest in and making sure that that ecosystem
grows with Microsoft. It's kind of our DNA and we've always believed that ﬁnancially,
maybe going back to diﬀerentiation question, I think an important one. I have made
in the past, even like six months, number of conversations with partners like AWS
partner, I think they're going to pat me in the back. And I'm going to be more with
you. And so, this is not in their DNA. But it's still core to what Microsoft does and
believe.
So Satya talks a lot about AI. How does the Company build sustainable, competitive
advantage here?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Simple thing, we did what was a moonshot at the time and has really paid oﬀ with it.
We laid a new technology fabric called FPGA, ﬁeld-programmable gate array. But it's
basically a way to get processing speed at -- in the silicon actually. And many years
ago, we started this project and we've now fully lined our entire as a cloud with this
new technology, let's assume incredible new ultrafast processing capabilities.
And that's a very unique diﬀerentiator that will take anyone near, even if they have
started the journey with other than they have just talked about, the way we've done it
is incredibly unique and diﬀerentiated. And so in terms of thinking about massive
turnkey power on the wire, video analysis, those type of things and we now have a
very unique infrastructure for. They have already put in market. But in just that it's not
just that, it's also intelligence graph, we have the Microsoft graph looking at all the
diﬀerent activities and correlations going on and all things, Oﬃce 365. We have our
of intelligence security graph looking at all the diﬀerent security signals from all of
our diﬀerent clouds who let us view in diﬀerent things from that perspective.
So we have a pretty unique position in terms of the insight that we can put and
utilize in an artiﬁcial intelligence way, which is a diﬀerent graphs as well as the
fundamentals cloud infrastructure that we put in place, that put us in a very strong
position, frankly.
Okay. Last question, we were sitting here 12 months from now, what goals would you
expect the cloud business to have achieved?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
A year for now, it will be well on our way to hitting our 20 billion cloud metric that we
had laid out for. So on top of that for sure. Into AI area, we would be a clear leader in
artiﬁcial intelligence, capabilities and what customers are actually realizing in
production with AI versus just dreaming about.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

OperatorYou think it will be, we'll see production AI workloads next year?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
I do think so.
Okay.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes, in real practical ways, then I think we'll see really good closure of the gap
between an IA space between Azure and AWS in the terms of closing that up.
What do you mean by closing that up?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
In terms of the overall market share.
Okay, right, with that, thank you Julia. Thank you very much. Thanks everybody for
coming.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Thank you.
