Well, good morning and welcome to the Starbucks Annual Meeting of our
shareholders, our 25th as a public company and, as you now know, my last as CEO.
Let me begin by thanking the Seattle Recruiting Battalion Color Guard representing
United States Army and the Starbucks choir, please give them a nice round of
applause.
There are number of important guests I'd just like to acknowledge and recognize.
Our entire board is here this morning. We'll introduce them formally in a little while.
But I would like to introduce and recognize our three new directors and ask them to
stand. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft. Thank you. Rosalind Brewer, the FormerFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22

Page 2 of 47CEO and President of Sam's Club, and Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, the Head of the LEGO
Group.
We had a board meeting yesterday and board dinner, and they weren't shy, they
were right in there, and the three of you are going to add so much value to the
company. Thank you very much for becoming part of the Starbucks family. Thank
you.
27 years ago, when a young, brash kid from New York was trying to raise money for a
coﬀee company that was not succeeding in Chicago, people could not pronounce
the Italian names on our menu, not a lot of people are willing to invest in our
company. And 27 years ago, one venture capitalist stood up and he is retiring from
the Starbucks Florida after 27 years. I want to say thank you and really recognize with
great respect and admiration, Jamie Shennan. Jamie, where are you?
I know we have a number of business partners internationally are here, Plácido
Arango from Spain, Alberto and Paulina Torrado from Mexico, Noey and Quito
(02:38) Lopez from the Philippines, Rocco Princi from Italy, thank you for being here.
It means a lot that you've travelled all this way. Thank you.
And I would like to ask all service members, veterans, military spouses to stand up
and be recognized. Thank you. And to all the Starbucks partners who are here today
and the thousands who are watching on the webcast from 75 countries, everything
we do is for you and that what we've tried over the years is really demonstrate the
compassion of our company, and our shareholders are here to applaud and salute
all of you who wear the green apron. Thank you so much. Thank you.
And last, last thank you. My wife Sheri is not here tonight – today. We – two weeks
early our grandson arrived on Sunday. She's back in New York. 25 years, no one can
do anything like this alone. All the families that represent our partners and my wife,
Sherri, sand our kinds as to – they all know that I stand on their shoulders and I'm
here because of them. Thank you so much. Thank you, Sheri.
Okay. Those are the thank you's. So, let's begin. Every hour of every day someone,
somewhere, everywhere in the world is walking into a place named Starbucks. And
as we gather here today there are over 26,000 stores in 75 countries and, last week
alone, over 90 million customers passed through our stores. And we now employ
over 330,000 partners who proudly wear the green apron somewhere in the world.
From the very beginning, we said that we're in business for a number of reasons, but
we're also in business to create value for our people. And I wanted to share with you,
after 25 years of being a public company, I think what we're most proud of is the
unbelievable commitment and conviction we've had to our partners and our
families. And as we go forward not only are we trying to build shareholder value for
you, but at the same time we take it very seriously, the conviction we have, to make
sure that we share success with our people and bring our families along with us. So,
for all the partners who are watching us, as I said earlier, make no mistake about it,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 47we link shareholder value for value for our partners, and that has made the Starbucks
experience so special after all these years.
Now, 25 years ago, in 1992, it's hard to believe this little coﬀee company with about a
150 stores, and only one quarter of proﬁtability was getting ready to go public. And,
of course, in Seattle and on the West Coast, there was great fan fear about what
Starbucks could accomplish. But as we went on the road show and try to talk about
the Starbucks story, there was resistance. And interestingly enough, there wasn't
much resistance about whether or not what we do every day in our stores was going
to transfer to other markets. The resistance came because, two years before the IPO,
we had the novel idea at that time to recognize that, for us to succeed as a company,
we had to exceed the expectations of our people, so that they could exceed the
expectations of our customers. And the way that manifested itself as we became the
ﬁrst company in America to provide equity in the form of stock options and
comprehensive health insurance, in 1990, to everyone who worked with Starbucks,
including those people who are working 20 hours a week part-time people.
And that became the foundation of the culture of the company. But the
shareholders, who are looking at investing in a public company, a retail public
company, many of whom made the decision and the conclusion that those beneﬁts
and the generosity of the company, the benevolence of Starbucks management at
that time, that these beneﬁts would be shareholder dilutive in the sense that it would
not create value as much as it could if we gave that money back to the shareholders.
And that was a very important moment because it imprinted in all of us the
conviction we had then, as we do now, in recognizing that it's not about the
healthcare, it's not about the equity in the form of stock options, it's about creating
the balance that we've always believed in in creating long-term value for the
shareholder, proﬁt in everything we do but at the same time recognizing the
importance of the fragile balance of social impact, conscience, benevolence and
serving the communities and serving our people.
So, as we look back on the 25-year public history of the company and how others
viewed us then and how they view us now, what we've accomplished in terms of the
record ﬁnancial performance is just about unparalleled. I mean, when you look at this
slide, it's hard to believe that a small coﬀee company in 1992 that had a 150 stores
and a market cap of $250 million at the IPO is sitting today with a market capital of
over $80 billion. And if you were smart enough to hold on to your stock - Jack,
(09:07) I know you were – and you invested $1,000 in 1992, that investment is worth
over $180,000 today. We're pretty proud of that, but not many people believed.
So, there are shareholders here today. I see them friends of mine Jack and Nancy
Rogers, Carol Bobo, Steve and Laurie Ritt. These are people who were kind of friends
of mine in those early days who really, really believed that we could build a diﬀerent
kind of company. So, I think that, as we think about what's really important and what
has driven the success and as I stand here before you, of course it's the quality of the
coﬀee and the store design and everything, but it's the culture, it's the values. And as
a result of that, we have been recognized time and time again as having one of theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 47most respected and recognized brands in the world. And just last week, the equity of
the Starbucks brand was once again recognized.
For the 11th consecutive year, Starbucks was named one of the world's most ethical
companies in the world by Ethisphere Institute. And then Fortune magazine, which
does this study every year, named Starbucks the third most admired company in the
world. I mean – Satya, I'm glad you're on that list, I got to tell you. But when I was a
kid growing up, no, hey – when I was a kid growing up, GE was everything. And I
look at Starbucks on the same list as GE, I just – I can only wish my parents were here
to really understand what Starbucks has become. So, we're very proud of that as a
company, very proud of that personally.
So, you look at the ﬁnancial performance, which has been extraordinary, and here I
am in front of you in a year where it's been kind of an anomaly for Starbucks because
it's one of the few years in our public life where the stock is not up year-over-year.
And, of course, the Sabres are out for Howard and something is wrong, we got our
mobile order and pay issue and there's congestion and we have analysts who
believe maybe the bloom is oﬀ the rose at Starbucks. They don't know what you're
talking about.
So, even though the stock is not up year-over-year, if you ask me to kind of assess
this past year, putting the stock price aside for a moment, I'd honesty say and I
believe this, that this probably has been one of our best, most strongest, most
meaningful years in our history. And let me tell you why. One is we've always taken
the long view. We've always tried to invest ahead of the growth curve. We've always
recognized that success is best when it's shared, bringing our people along on the
journey and investing in the communities in which we operate. Never succumbing to
short-term pressures and the mentality of others but being true to the long-term
aspirations of building a great and enduring company.
Now, two years ago, when I stood on this stage, I framed a very important question
that was heartfelt, was personal and something that I was very concerned about. And
that was, what is the role and responsibility for a for-proﬁt company. If you think back
two years ago and where we are today, I think that question and the answers to that
question are more important than ever before.
So, it begs a number of questions. For example, why are we opening up stores in
Ferguson, Missouri, Inglewood outside of Chicago, Jamaica, Queens? Why did we
convene over 40 like-minded companies to try and hire 1 million opportunity youth
among the 5 million young people aged 16 to 24 years, mostly African American and
Latino who are not in school and not in work. Why would we do that? Why have we
hired 10,000 veterans and their spouses? Why have we opened over 30 family
military stores near bases around the country? Why were we one of the ﬁrst
companies in America to support marriage equality? And why are we the only
company in America providing free four-year tuition for every single person at
Starbucks? Why are we doing that? Why do we host an Annual Meeting in China for
the parents and the families of Chinese partners? Why we do anything quite like
that? Why did we have the courage, the conviction to address the issue of race andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 47try and elevate the national conversation about racism? And yes, why did we make
the announcement, just a few weeks ago, to hire 10,000 refugees globally?
And the answer, for me personally and everyone that works with me, is pretty simple.
Not every decision in business is an economic one and because leadership and
moral courage is not a passive act. Because, since 1971, when we opened the ﬁrst
store in the Pike Place Market and again in 1992 when we went public from Seattle to
Mumbai, from Shanghai to Paris, Starbucks has succeeded because of our people,
because we recognize what our responsibility is in addition to making a proﬁt. It's
also a reminder that these investments and levels of innovation are not only
marketing and customer-facing, they're about conscience. And we have, for
decades, been driven by principles, guided by a set of beliefs that are steeped in
humanity. That is the role and responsibility of a public company. And I think a great
way to kind of demonstrate that to you is just a short, a very short video that we put
together, that's not marketing and not about a press release. It's literally about the
compassion of the company. Take a look.
[Video Presentation] (16:28-17:35)
So, I can assure you that our commitment to building long-term value for you, our
shareholders going forward is an absolute. But looking ahead, we're going to
advance this work even more boldly in the years to come. Three years ago, we said
we'd hire 10,000 veterans and military spouses by 2018. I'm proud to announce what
we've already met and exceeded that goal. Thank you.
And let me just say something about that, that I think is important. So much was
written as veterans were coming home and trying to make the transition from military
life to civilian life. We sat down with a group of young people who were getting
ready for the transition. And I heard one of them make a comment that I'll never
forget when he said that he had more anxiety and trepidation about going to a job
interview than he had about going back to Afghanistan. Think about that.
And unfortunately, so many people who are coming back from Afghanistan and Iraq
were kind of misrepresented about who they were and what they've done. These are
extraordinary people who have been through extraordinary things. But they come
back with skills, leadership, ethics, integrity, not an ounce of entitlement. And every
one of them that has come to work at Starbucks in our oﬃce wearing the green
apron, on their own merit, have done a great job, but they have made us a better
company. We are better because of them. And so, we're upping our goal and we're
going to hire 25,000 by 2025.
And that's not all, two years ago we made a commitment to hire 10,000 opportunity
youth at Starbucks. We've exceeded that goal and we have 40,000 now. We've held
job fairs in Seattle, Chicago, Arizona, Los Angeles. And I was looking for that photo.
This photo here, this is like 8 AM in Los Angeles. We open the doors to our job fair
and these young kids, and you can see how they're dressed, you can see their facial
expressions, they are running into the door and all they're looking for is one thing,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 47and that is that their station in life should not deﬁne them and all they're looking for
is an opportunity. And just like the veterans that we've hired, these young people
have done extraordinary things at Starbucks and all they're looking for is for
someone to open up the door and to view them on their own merit. So, we're
upping our goal for opportunity youth and we'll try and hire 100,000 by 2020.
And ﬁnally, building on our Starbucks College Achievement program with the
partnership with Arizona State University. We've created a new program, which is
called Pathway to Admission. And that basically opens access to college to every
Starbucks' partner who previously did not qualify for college for one reason or
another. So, regardless of your test scores, regardless of your history, everyone at
Starbucks is now going to have access to a free four-year college tuition. And we
hope to have 25,000 partners graduate from ASU by 2025.
So, as I mentioned, this is my last Annual Meeting as the CEO of Starbucks. And the
question has been, what is going to be my role and responsibility going forward as
Executive Chairman. And I will be focusing a majority of my eﬀorts on the new area
of the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve brand and retail innovation.
So, two years ago, we began this program, and with the Reserve brand, and we've
had an unbelievable success with the Seattle Roastery. But I just want to take you
back to something. In 2008, 2009, as we were having this trouble, I wrote down this
little private story to myself. I wasn't clairvoyant, but I was dreaming about
something. And the dream was, could we create a diﬀerent, immersive, theatrical,
romantic kind of ﬂagship experience that did not exist not only in coﬀee but
anywhere? Could we take the elements of Disney and Willy Wonka and do
something that would just be dream-like? Can we take our customers on a magical
carpet ride?
Well, the Seattle Roastery has done just that and more. And we are now on our way
to a whole new level of expansion and opportunities with the Roastery. Beginning
with the fact that we discovered an extraordinary artisanal baker in Milan, and that's
Rocco Princi who's here today. I tried to convince him for like seven years to be our
partner and he kept saying no. He operates ﬁve stores in Milan and one in London,
kept saying no, no, no. I thought we had a language problem because he doesn't
speak English, I don't speak Italian, but we both spoke the language of love and I
got him to Seattle. I took him into the Roastery. And this fall we will be bringing Princi
food, fresh baked, which we're actually baking into the Roastery, and we'll bring
Princi into all of the Roasteries going forward.
So, if you look at this map – wow, look at this. So, go back please. So, the Seattle
Roastery, far left, Princi food on the left. This is in New York, on the corner of 9th and
15th in the Meatpacking District next to the Chelsea Market, across from Google,
next to Apple. This is under construction.
Shanghai, which will be almost twice the size of Seattle, two levels, in a location we
can only dream about, Nanjing Road, will open up in December. You're all invited.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 47Kevin R. JohnsonAnd the crown jewel of it all, has been my lifelong dream since I walked the streets
of Milan in 1983, to one day open in Milan. And we decided, we just can't open up a
store, we have to open Roastery.
So, last week we were in Milan making the announcement, and take a look.
[Video Presentation] (24:54-27:21)
That was an extraordinary moment for all of us and for me personally when that
Roastery opens in Italy in about a year and a half. It will be a seminal moment for the
company, for me. And going back to 1983, who could've possibly imagined that we
would be here celebrating 25 years as a public company. So, as I said before, we've
tried from day one to play the long game. I can't imagine to be surrounded by a
more talented, committed, compassionate team of senior leaders of Starbucks and
now led by one person, Kevin Johnson.
So, let me tell you a little bit about Kevin and why I'm so enthused, why I'm so
conﬁdent and why, as shareholders, you should feel very, very comfortable that the
company is in extraordinary hands with a great person and a great leader.
I worked side-by-side with Kevin in the last two years when he has been President
and COO of Starbucks. And six years prior to that, he served with great distinction as
a outside board member, and certainly everyone on the board would agree with
that.
Who is Kevin Johnson? Above all else, he is a servant leader with a tremendous
sense of humanity, compassion and an understanding, a deep understanding of the
human condition. He has been labeled, maybe fairly and unfairly at times, as a
technologist. I mean, that may be his advocation but he's an extraordinary person
who has a great understanding of Starbucks' business, what it means to be a
merchant and, above all else, the partner experience.
So, we thought a great way to introduce Kevin, before he comes on stage, is just to
give you a glimpse into Kevin, his life and the man. Take a look.

Please welcome the next Chief Executive Oﬃcer of Starbucks Coﬀee Company,
Kevin Johnson.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone. This
is my eight Annual Shareholder Meeting, and this is a very special one for me.
Certainly, it's the opportunity to recognize and celebrate what Howard and the
hundreds of thousands of Starbucks partners throughout the years have created.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 47Now, my life journey has taken me to this place here today. As a young boy, the
mission of sending a man to the moon captivated me. It always begins with a bold
aspiration and a mission, to inspire and nurture the human spirit one person, one
cup, one neighborhood at a time.
How many publicly traded companies do you know that have a mission statement
that begins with the words, to inspire and nurture the human spirit. Only one I know,
and that's why Starbucks hold a special place in my heart. Every life experience I've
had, every achievement, every struggle, every lesson learned, every person that
touched has shaped me. And Starbucks has shaped me. And I can tell you I'm
prepared to do the hard work that it takes to elevate this great brand in Starbucks
and lead us into the future.
And I'm so optimistic, so optimistic about the future for three reasons, three reasons
that I think are relevant to all shareholders. First, human connection. Starbucks is in
the business of human connection in a world that needs it now more than ever.
Second, relevant innovation. We have the strongest innovation pipeline in the history
of the company. And third, China. China is our fastest-growing market and
represents an amazing opportunity.
Now let me take you through each one of these reasons in more detail, and then I'm
going to connect them back together to our commitment to creating shareholder
value.
Human connection. Starbucks partners around the world connect with over 90
million customers a week. The concept of the third place is universally accepted as a
gathering place for community, a place for people to connect. Communities
embrace their local Starbucks as a hub.
Now, this was so evident to me a year ago. A year ago, I attended the store opening
in Ferguson, Missouri. Certainly following the unrest, the protests and the riots that
unfolded in Ferguson in 2014, we decided to build a Starbucks store in support of
the community at Ferguson. When we announced we're putting a store in Ferguson,
a young man, Cordell Lewis, heard about Starbucks coming to Ferguson and he
applied to be the store manager and we hired Cordell. Cordell Lewis is here today.
Let's give a hand for Cordell.
Now, when I arrived for that store visit, Cordell had hired this wonderful team of
baristas. Some were tenured Starbucks partners and some, it was their very ﬁrst job.
On the day of the opening, community leaders, leaders from the urban league, the
Mayor, the City Council, police oﬃcers and citizens of Ferguson showed up for that
store opening with excitement, optimism about their community. Every person who
was there was proud to be able to say that Ferguson would now have a Starbucks. It
was a vote of conﬁdence for their community.
Now, I listened to these customers, I listened to our partners that day in Ferguson,
and I observed something. I observed a sense of connection, a desire to comeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 47together and a feeling of joy.
Now, the week prior to the store opening, Howard was in South Africa opening our
ﬁrst Starbucks store in South Africa. And when we got back to Seattle, we sat down in
Howard's oﬃce and we shared our experiences. Two store openings in very diﬀerent
places, diﬀerent hemispheres, diﬀerent continents, but with the same similar
sentiment from customers and partners, pride, community and joy. And I ask myself,
why is it that people almost 10,000 miles apart, diﬀerent hemispheres, diﬀerent
continents, but they had the same reaction, why? The answer, human connection.
Now, following that visit, a few months later, I was reading an article in Fortune
magazine. And the ﬁrst paragraph of that article captured me. It said, humans were
not designed to be solitary creatures. We evolved to survive in tribes. The need to
interact is so deeply engrained in our genetic code, so much so that the absence of
social connection triggers the same primal alarm bells as thirst, hunger and pain.
Wow.
So, I looked and the quote was from a leading researcher on human connection from
the University of Chicago, John Cacioppo. So what did I do? I picked up the phone
and I called the University of Chicago switchboard and I asked to speak to John. And
he took my call. So, John, my name is Kevin. I'm at Starbucks. I want to learn more
about your research around human connection and John spent an hour educating
me on his studies around what he believes is a modern day epidemic of chronic
loneliness.
And he shared with me. He said, Kevin, I think that my research points to three
factors, or at least three factors. He said, for example, the rise of technology, often
times, people are spending more time in their device than they are connecting with
another human being. He said growing division in the world causes people to turn
inward. And he said in periods of economic struggle, people have to spend more
time working and less time with family. The antidote he says, human connection.
Well, that is the business of Starbucks. There are so many great stories of our
partners connecting with customers in meaningful ways that changes their lives. And
I just picked one to share with you today. Let's roll the video.
[Video Presentation] (41:15-42:41)
Human connection, it happens every day in 26,000 stores around the world. It is our
foundation, and it is a strong foundation. But we are also innovators. We're driving
relevant innovation for our customers that ampliﬁes Starbucks as a destination, and
our innovation pipeline is the strongest in the history of the company. Beverage,
food, store design, equipment, digital, every aspect of the innovation that it takes to
create customer experiences that are joyful.
Now let's start coﬀee innovation. Starbucks Reserve has created the renaissance of
small lot coﬀees. Two examples, Eastern Congo. Our work with the Eastern CongoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 10 of 47initiative is rebuilding the country's coﬀee industry. They are now producing coﬀee
that is a customer favorite with its lively orange citrus ﬂavor and nodes of cocoa.
Pantheon Blend is a one-of-a-kind blend made up from Reserve coﬀees from
Ethiopia, Nicaragua, Guatemala.
When it comes to coﬀee beverages, the Roastery in Seattle has now become our
innovation incubator. Beverages like Cascara Latte were invented in the Roastery and
are now part of our core Starbucks beverage oﬀerings across the entire footprint.
The latest innovation from the Roastery, barrel-aged coﬀee. Let's take a look.
[Video Presentation] (44:26-45:23)
Barrel-aged coﬀee at the Roastery, today.
Now, these are just two examples of many where the Roastery is fueling innovation
that will propagate throughout the Starbucks ﬂeet.
Now let's move on to tea and tea innovation. Today, we sell over $1 billion of Teavana
teas in Starbucks stores around the world. And we listen to our customers.
Customers care about wellness, they care about natural ingredients, they're working
to ﬁnd ways to reduce calories and no added sugars.
So later this summer, we are introducing new Teavana Shaken Iced Tea infusions.
Shaken Iced Tea infusions take our freshly steeped core Teavana teas and we
combine them with freshly steeped ﬂavors that come from fruit and botanical blends
that deliver this delicious ﬂavored beverage that are free from artiﬁcial ﬂavors and
sweeteners.
Now, we are reducing the added sugars in all of our standard tea beverages and you
can request them unsweetened. Teavana Iced Tea infusions, delicious, unsweetened
at zero grams of added sugar, a great, great beverage.
Food innovation. Let me highlight some of the work we're doing in the areas of food.
We recently launched the new Sous Vide Egg Bites in January and I can tell you they
are a hit, when you can ﬁnd them. We are adding capacity as fast as we can to not
only catch up but keep up with customer demand.
Now, we've also listened to customer feedback around more gluten-free choices,
right? Now, in fact, at the last two annual shareholder meetings, one of our
shareholders, Mr. Katz. Mr. Katz has come to the microphone two years in a row
during the Q&A session and he has request – made his request for more gluten-free
choices. Mr. Katz, are you here today? Okay. Mr. Katz, this one is for you. Yesterday,
we launched another gluten-free item on the menu, our Smoked Canadian Bacon
Breakfast Sandwich with more gluten-free innovation coming. Mr. Katz, thanks for the
feedback.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 11 of 47Now let's talk about lunch. Another big opportunity for Starbucks. Now last year, I sat
down and met with our chefs in the Innovation Lab. And I asked them, I asked them
to provide us with a culinary point of view for a wonderful lunch menu. And they
went on a discovery journey. They came back from that discovery journey and they
said, Kevin, here's an idea.
What if we created a Mediterranean, California-inspired culinary experience for lunch
that is second to none? And they said, what if we created a supply chain so it could
be prepared fresh daily, prepared and consumed within a 24-hour period, so every
item is fresh. And what if we had the range of options from high-protein oﬀerings to
vegan? And what if at the end of the day, any of that food that was not sold through
in that store was then donated to feed the hungry. Introducing Starbucks Mercato,
vibrant salads, hearty sandwiches all made fresh daily.
Now, Mercato will be available in more than 100 stores in the Chicago area
beginning in mid-April, just a few weeks away. Based on the customer feedback and
reception, we'll then plan to expand into other markets. Now not only will Mercato,
the Mercato launch oﬀerings in Starbucks provide you a wonderful lunch selection, it
also contributes to the positive mission of feeding the hungry through our
FoodShare program. Mercato, in stores in Chicago mid-April.
Now digital, got to talk about digital. Before we jump in to the customer-facing
innovation coming from digital, I want to touch upon how we are using digital
technologies internal to Starbucks to create a real-time connection with our store
managers. Now you think about it, just in the U.S., we have over 9,000 company-
operated stores. And the question was posed, how can we better connect with our
store managers, how can we communicate with them in a two-way vehicle and do it
fast, and how can we help store managers create community amongst one another?
Well, in January, we implemented Workplace by Facebook. Now think of Workplace
by Facebook as a private Facebook for Starbucks partners to communicate and
share information. Workplace allows us now to stream live open forums and have
real-time dialogue with our store managers. We launched this in January with a live
open forum hosted by Howard and myself with all store managers in the U.S., that's
what you see up here on the screen. This was actual live open forum in January. And
you can see by the slide, we are getting real-time comments, hearts, thumbs up,
sometimes a thumbs down, mostly thumbs ups, and store managers asking us
questions.
Now, this was a new experience for both Howard and myself, but we have now
started doing these Workplace live open forums with our store managers every
month. And store managers have now found a way to create community and better
connect with us.
Some recent examples, about a month ago, a store manager posted on Workplace.
They posted a post that said that they are selling more than 20 beverages a day that
are not on our oﬃcial beverage menu. They are beverages that were featured onFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22

Page 12 of 47Gerri Martin-FlickingerInstagram. How many people use Instagram to get your beverage? See, all kinds of
beverages on Instagram. Well, they're selling 20 a day. They're not sure they have
the right recipe. Well, within 24-hour period, nearly 40 other store managers also
posted and said, I too, I'm selling 15 of these a day, I'm selling 30 of these a day.
And then that evening, our category marketing team saw the volume of posts and
how much this beverage featured on Instagram was selling in our stores and they
made a decision that night and posted back to store managers by the next morning
that they had made the decision to add this to the oﬃcial beverage recipes,
something that could have taken weeks, if not months to happen before Workplace,
happened in one day. That is creating visibility with our store managers that's
enabling us to have more velocity in the way we make decisions, so we can better
serve our store managers and our partners in the stores.
All right, customer-facing digital. Mobile Order & Pay continues to grow, and just last
month, it represented more than 8% of all transactions in the United States. And in
our last earnings call, we highlighted how we are focusing on increasing throughput,
improving the customer experience and reducing congestion at the handoﬀ plane.
Now, we have already deployed a number of these measures and they are having a
positive eﬀect.
For example, in our busiest stores, we've added two new dedicated roles for
partners at that peak just for Mobile Order & Pay. We've streamlined the handoﬀ
plane in the way that beverages are consolidated and given to our customers. And
we've deployed new tools to support the increased throughput.
Now, the early feedback from store managers and customers has been very positive.
But keep in mind, these are just the ﬁrst steps of a number of things we are doing to
improve capacity and throughput in our store, and rest assured that this progress will
continue to be fully felt in the back half of this ﬁscal year.
Now to show you some of the new innovation and the exciting new customer
features that we are bringing to our mobile app, I want to introduce our Chief
Technology Oﬃcer, Gerri Martin-Flickinger. Gerri?

Thank you, Kevin. Good morning. I am so pleased to have the opportunity to spend
a few minutes with you today to talk a little about the digital innovation at Starbucks.
At its core, Starbucks is all about the importance of human connection, one person,
one cup of coﬀee and one neighborhood at a time. I truly believe that technology
when done well helps enrich and enhance the human connection. And over the last
several years, we've innovated to make our mobile application even more
personalized.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 13 of 47Let me start by taking you on the journey. We launched Starbucks mobile application
three years ago, and we started with mobile payment, giving customers the ability to
pay from their phone and track rewards. It was less than two years ago that we
enhanced this application to allow ordering, and further extending our brick-and-
mortar stores with added digital convenience. And this year, we extended this
experience to make it personal, and let me explain how.
We leverage artiﬁcial intelligence and big data. We stitch data from many diﬀerent
sources, including a customer's past purchases, information about trends, weather
data, as well as product availability at a store. And then we give each and every
customer personalized oﬀers and recommendations to anticipate and delight. And
that's not all. We also surprised customers with games that are developed just for
them, giving our customers rewards and opportunities to try new products or visit
more frequently.
Like Kevin said, our customers have made it clear that these personalized
experiences are enriching their connection to Starbucks. Starbucks reward members.
The spend is 20% higher than last year. And we've seen a tripling of personalized
marketing sales lift, reﬂecting a more engaged member base.
The growth of MOP has been impressive. Our highest-volume MOP stores are
seeing more than 20% of their transactions through MOP at peak. And as Kevin
mentioned, with this volume, we recognized the need to continue to streamline and
enhance the in-store experience.
We're using and testing text notiﬁcation to let customers know their orders are
ready, allowing our customers time to relax and improving the experience at the
handoﬀ plane. We're also introducing technology to help our baristas manage the
production of orders, so they can focus on the customer engagement.
So we've talked a lot about Mobile Order & Pay and the digital device. But that's only
one form of interaction. Today, customers can even pay with an iWatch. And I'm sure
we can all imagine many more devices and many more methods of digital
engagement.
As innovation continues to touch all of our lives, the way we interact with technology
is also radically changing. And I love to ask the question, how many of you took a
typing class to learn to use a computer? Yeah. I mean, I see some hands out there.
Okay. How many of your kids took typing? Yeah. Okay. So if your kids are like my
kids, they use one ﬁnger and they point and click. And I would suggest to you that
the next generation won't even do that. They will use their voice.
Earlier this year, we announced voice ordering in our mobile application. Let's take a
quick look at how this works.
[Video Presentation] (58:34-59:02)FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 14 of 47So, this feature has already rolled out to about 100,000 customers, and we plan to
have it rolled out nationwide by the end of the year.
As you can imagine, the opportunity for voice and other settings becomes quite
intriguing. For example, we've delivered an Alexa skill that allows you to order coﬀee
at home from your Amazon Echo.
Our technology foundation is allowing us to embrace conversational commerce
very, very rapidly. In fact, I'd like to give you a sneak peek of something that I got a
chance to see this morning.
[Video Presentation] (59:58-01:01:05)
So what you just saw was real, available in market later this year for customers with
the Alexa skill and a Ford with SYNC 3. So it only takes a little imagination to think
about where conversational ordering will show up next, but we'll save a few things
for next year's shareholders meeting.
I'd like to shift now to gifting. Over the years, giving and receiving Starbucks gift
cards has become iconic. They are given for birthdays, holidays, thank yous, business
events or just because. Traditionally, our customers have purchased gift cards from
our stores and other retailers, and now customers can also purchase them digitally in
our MLP app or website.
But what if we let gifting occur in other channels? What about social channels, the
virtual places where you engage with your friends, your colleagues and loved ones
every single day? Earlier this year, we released an add-in for Microsoft Outlook 365,
which many consumers and businesses use for e-mail. The add-in allows you to give
someone a Starbucks gift card without ever leaving your e-mail session with just a
few clicks. What an amazing way to quickly send a thank you or a birthday gift.
This spring, we'll release Starbucks gifting for iMessage. This will allow our customers
to give a Starbucks gift card within an iMessage conversation on an iPhone or an
iPad. Let me show you how this feature works.
In this example, two coworkers are messaging one another. One coworker wants to
thank his colleague for a job well-done. Without leaving the iMessage conversation,
he's able to select a gift card and pay with Apple Pay with just a few taps. The
recipient can redeem the gift card right from their iPhone using Apple Pay. This will
be released in April.
And that's just the beginning with many more social gifting solutions coming all with
the intent of making gift-giving and receiving even easier for our customers. The
trends I've been talking about here today are not just U.S.-centric. We're driving
towards these types of solutions all around the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22

Thanks, Gerri.
{BIO 15334242 <GO>}
Good job.
{BIO 20115764 <GO>}
Thank you. Thanks, Gerri. Good morning. My name is Molly Liu. I'm a ﬁve-year
partner. I think I have the best job in the company. I lead the Digital Ventures team
for Starbucks China. Very excited today to share with you a recent social
phenomenon we created across our second whole market.
It was a mission to inspire and nurture the human spirit that brought me to Starbucks
ﬁve years ago. We have been true to this mission. Our 2,600 stores across Mainland
China serve as an attractive third place destination that brings people together over
a cup of coﬀee.
As we expand the experience to the digital platforms, we saw a unique opportunity
for Starbucks to create deeper social connection digitally, to encourage and cultivate
a behavior of everyday kindness and appreciation among family and friends, a
behavior truly needed in today's fast-developing China. This was the purpose
behind creating a breakthrough social gifting feature. We wanted to partner with the
strongest social engine. Hence, the strategic partnership with Tencent WeChat was
formed last December.
With over 889 million active users, of which many of them logging every day and
about half of them spend at least 90 minutes on the app, Tencent WeChat is one of
the most powerful social media in the world. Starbucks and WeChat co-created a
social gifting experience and aﬀectionately named it Say it with Starbucks, [Foreign
Language] (01:06:02), which had a similar pronunciation as [Foreign Language]
(01:06:08), meaning, say it with your heart.
We aspire to deepen the shared moments of connection by allowing our customers
to speak from their heart, together with a gift of Starbucks coﬀee or digital store
value card. I want to share with you how in a very short time, Say it with Starbucks has
a made a diﬀerence in my own life.
My ﬁrst gift was sent to my best friend from college, Asing (01:06:40). We no longer
live in the same city and haven't met for a long time. My biggest regret was not
being able to be there for her when she most needed my support.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 16 of 47Kevin R. JohnsonWhen I browse through the social gifting oﬀerings, the Thinking Of You card caught
my attention and I immediately picked one for Asing (01:07:01). Paid with WeChat
Pay and easily selected Asing (01:07:06) from my WeChat contact list. The gifting
feature also allows me to edit or attach text, photo or video in my greetings.
I wrote a personal note to encourage my friend ﬁnd more time to relax in a Starbucks
store and the coﬀee is on me, for sure. She received the gift instantly and replied
with a big smile. If you think about it, 25 seconds were all that it took for me to make
up for this long overdue reconnection and her big smiley face reply really made my
day.
While sending a gift is a convenient and rewarding experience, receiving one could
create a memorable moment of surprise and delight in anyone's life. I just received
such a surprise gift from my little boy, Harry, this morning. He knows that I need
coﬀee to overcome jet lag ﬂying from China. So, he sent me a latte, together with a
heart-melting video.
[Video presentation] (01:08:18-01:08:27)
I miss you, too. I miss you, too. I'm going to hug you right now, baby. My stories are
only two out of the over 1 million stories of love, friendship, connection and
appreciation that has happened in the past six weeks since we launched Say it with
Starbucks. Our customers have fallen in love with this innovative feature for the
seamless experience, emotional attachment and personal touch. Many customers
purchased more than one gift and keep coming back. Many gift receivers start to
purchase a gift and passing the love to other people as well, making this a truly viral
social phenomenon.
You can tell that I am extremely proud of the Starbucks and WeChat partners who
worked tirelessly to bring this innovation to life. I'm also humbled when our
customers recognize Starbucks for being not only a global brand that oﬀers the best-
in-class service, but also a local brand that created truly relevant experience for the
Chinese people. Despite the early success, this is only the beginning of an exciting
Starbucks digital journey in China. The best is yet to come.
Thanks again for the opportunity of sharing with you what we're doing in China.
Thank you. Now, let's welcome Kevin.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Thank you, Gerri and Molly. Now, in case you didn't realize what Molly said, there's
over 800 million active users of WeChat in China – around the world. In the ﬁrst six
weeks of launching this social gifting feature, over 1.2 million gifts have been given
and are being redeemed in our stores in China; huge, huge opportunity.
Now, what I've shared with you are just a few of the innovative things coming. But I
strongly believe that we have the strongest innovation pipeline in the history of theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 17 of 47company. But now, I want to build on what you saw from Molly and amplify the
importance of our work in China. Our Starbucks China team is world-class, world-
class. And I'm proud of the work they've done to get us to this point.
Perhaps, nowhere has the Starbucks experience been embraced more
enthusiastically than in China, a country we entered 18 years ago. It is our fastest-
growing market with over 2,600 stores across 127 cities, serving more than 5 million
customer visits per week. Now, we're committed to double the number of stores in
China over the next ﬁve years. And today, we are opening a new store in China every
15 hours.
So, when I put these three things together, Starbucks is about human connection at a
time when human connection is in more demand. We have the strongest innovation
pipeline in the history of the company, and we have this amazing opportunity in
China. I add those three things together and I come up with one conclusion, growth.
This is why I'm so optimistic about our future in creating shareholder value. The fact
is that we've returned $10 billion of cash to shareholders over the last ﬁve years in
the form of dividends and share buybacks.
This year, we're deploying $1.6 billion of capital, much of it to build and renovate the
most proﬁtable stores in our history and create more shareholder value. And we are
investing for a future. We're investing for the long term by investing in our partners,
investing in digital to position us to capture this opportunity. Now you put this all
together and you should all have great conﬁdence in the future of Starbucks. But
there's one more reason why I believe in Starbucks, and it is the power of our
partners.
Starbucks has been a gift in my life and I've learned so much by traveling the world
and listening to partners share their life story, share what Starbucks means to them.
My partners have taught me three things. First, the power of one. One store, one
partner, one customer connection at a time. My partners have taught me the power
of family. When I do round tables in our stores, I have heard hundreds of times,
partners tell me, Kevin, these partners are my Starbucks family and I love them. And
the power of purpose. You've taught me that our reason for being, human
connection and doing good in the world has purpose that can change people's
lives.
It's about being part of something that is bigger than any one of us. It's a mission I
choose to pursue. So, I want to take this opportunity for all of us to recognize and
thank the more than 330,000 partners who proudly wear the green apron and the
partners who serve them day in and day out. This is recognition for the Starbucks
partners globally.
I'm proud to be your partner and I want you to know that I am here to serve you. To
our shareholders, I feel a great sense of responsibility to you as well. I know I have
Vienty (01:14:59) shoes to ﬁll, and that's not lost on me, but I will be authentic and

{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Let me try and explain what you just saw and how it relates to
the last 30 plus years of the Starbucks experience. First oﬀ, that is what we call a
open forum at Starbucks. And for the past 30-plus years, in order to really elevate
the internal conversation within our company, on a quarterly basis, domestically and
around the world, our leaders have, in our parlance, a open forum or a town hall.
And we learned over the years that most people that come to work for a company
had a previous job experience. And that job experience, more often than not,
disappointed them for whatever reason.
And so, we said early on that the currency to the culture, the values and guiding
principles of Starbucks has to be trust. And the question is, how do you build trust?
And so, after 30-plus years of having these kinds of meetings, we have created an
environment where people feel very safe, very vulnerable and if they have a
complaint or a concern, they know there's no retribution. And this has really created,
domestically and around the world, the opportunity for us to really understand with
great sensibility how our people are feeling about the company, each other, what
we're trying to do and most importantly, how can we get better and how can we
serve them even more.
The San Antonio open forum was very unique. We had a market visit in Texas two
weeks ago. We visit markets all the time. But while we were there, we decided to go
down to McAllen, Texas. For those of you that don't know where or what McAllen is,
it is the Rio Grande Valley and it is the border of the U.S.-Mexican border. And we
wanted to see ﬁrsthand the issues, the complexity, not to politicize but really to just
on the ground level see what people are experiencing. And without going into
detail, it was a heart-wrenching day for many of us who heard very, very tough
stories.
Now, we recognize this is a problem of great complexity that has been tried to solve
for many years now, but there's no doubt that there's been a signiﬁcant cause and
eﬀect on lots of people and Starbucks partners. And so the open forum was still with
tremendous emotion. And what you just saw was a snippet of what people had to
say and how they're feeling, who are living and working there.
So, we started thinking about what could we do today that would really, with great
transparency, demonstrate who we are. So, we're going to take a great risk,
unscripted, and for the next 20, 30 minutes, we're going to have an open forum that
Kevin and I are going to host.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22

Gosh, there's a lot of people out there. Morning, everybody. My name is Jenny
Roberts. I work in the sourcing department and I've been a partner for two years.
And I've always said if I ever got the chance to get in front of our leadership, I would
thank them for updating recently our parental leave policy. It's something that I
thought about a lot and is really important to me. My daughter just turned one-year
old last week. She was born last year eight weeks premature and I was in the hospital
for a week. She was in the hospital for four weeks. And at the time, I was a single
income earner for my family and it was, as you can imagine, a really diﬃcult time for
us.
And so, when the partner resources team opened up for us to have a forum to
discuss, where we were last fall with the parental leave policy, I attended because I
really felt strongly about sharing my feelings and my family's experiences. And at the
time, what I said was I think that I really believe in this company's mission and vision
and values and our ability to choose and do the right thing.
And lo and behold, a couple of months ago, it was announced that the parental
leave policy was updated. And I just wanted to thank you from the bottom of my
heart. It's so important to us parents and people growing families and I can't say
thank you enough. I really appreciate that.

Unveriﬁed ParticipantHi, Howard and Kevin. Melissa Nussbaum. I am a 10-year partner and I'm proud to be
a Beneﬁt Specialist on the SCAP team here in Seattle. Over the past 10 years of
working for Starbucks, much like many tenured partners, I've been able to grow and
be in an inclusive environment. So, I kind of make the joke that I've come out two
times in my life. The ﬁrst time was nine years ago, I'm originally from a tiny town
called Raymond, Washington, home of 2,000 people. And it was really hard for me
to come out as a lesbian.
But thankfully to my Starbucks family, because we have such an inclusive
environment for members of the LGBTQ community, it was like a non-issue at
Starbucks. And so my Starbucks family really gave me the courage to be my
authentic self at work, do my best work because I could be myself.
And in addition, they gave me the courage to be myself with my family. So now my
family actually loves my wife way more than me, so they're all good. But it took them
a while, so thanks to Starbucks.
And the second time was a couple years ago, the Starbucks College Achievement
Plan program was announced. And until then, I felt like I was in the closet per se of
not have ﬁnished my college degree. I started out with WSU, life happened. And I
was the ﬁrst person in my family to go to college. My mom didn't earn a high school
diploma. So, I took a lot of pride in that and when I didn't ﬁnish it, it was a big chip
on my shoulder. So, I proudly stand up here and say that along with myself, my wife
will be graduating from the SCAP program spring 2018, and I will be the ﬁrst person
in my family with a college degree in spring 2018. Thank you.
Congratulations.
And you're both invited to my graduation.

were very diﬃcult and I was in the deepest of positions. So, in 2008, 2007, around
that time, I was able to ﬁnally, after so many long hurdles, become a legal resident.
And in 2013, I became a U.S. citizen. Thank you.
After becoming a U.S. citizen, I got my college degree and everything, but I still
couldn't ﬁnd a job, so the ﬁrst place I went to was Starbucks. So I took a leap of faith
and I applied. Two years later, I'm still here and it is now my pleasure to share this
because it goes to show that, yes, I was in that position, I was the bad person as the
President or anybody likes to call it, but you know, we're not all bad people. I am
here wearing the apron, in this case, the black apron, serving both sides of the U.S.
and Mexico border. We know being in that area, we are divided by a wall still, but
we're still the same community, same culture, same people, two diﬀerent languages
and two diﬀerent governments. So for me to serve both sides of the border in the
city of Brownsville, Texas, it is a huge honor.

really be your full authentic self and I've been able to do that at Starbucks each and
every day to come to work, to be vulnerable, to remove the mask, to share my story
and own it without being judged, but to be embraced and to be welcomed and that
feeling has really made a diﬀerence to me in my life.
And the second is opportunity. In my role, I have the good fortune of working with
leaders and partners in the ﬁeld in driving inclusion and diversity. Well, we've had
some good success, we have an opportunity to do more and that really excites me,
as to the opportunity to dream big and to have impact and thank you both for the
experience, I'm really grateful for it.

Good morning.
Good morning, partners and shareholders. My name is Saunjah Powell-Pointer and
I've been a partner for three years. I source furniture for our beautiful stores. And
there are two deﬁning moments in my career here at Starbucks. One of them was
December 10, 2014, when our leaders were brave enough to have an open dialogue
on race.
It touched me because it was on the backdrop of many unarmed black men being
killed and a lot of unrest around that. Because I have seven brothers and a host of
cousins and I know that that could have been them, it moved me in a way that will
stay with me for a lifetime.
And the second moment was June 19, 2015, and in a very quiet and humane way, our
leader, Mr. Howard Schultz, took time to go to Charleston, South Carolina after nine
people were killed at the Mother Emanuel Church. You asked me to join you on that
trip. I don't think that would have happened in any other company where you take
time to go make sure that the community feels safe, that the community is taken care
of, and to see what we can do to use our skill for good.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22

Howard S. SchultzAnd when we visited that church, and then we visited our partners in that store, and
we heard about how our partners activated that community, they created safety, they
created normalcy. Just that cup of coﬀee or their pastry got them through what
could have been a very harrowing experience for a lot of people.
There are partners who were not working, do you remember? And they came in to
work in order to be there for the community. And I was left with the vision of the
Mother Emanuel Church and chalk on a board behind our bar letting the community
to know that we stand by you, for you and with you. And that's what it means to be
performance-driven through the lens of humanity and I thank you for demonstrating
that leadership.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Appreciate it. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Thank you for sharing, it just brings tears in my eyes. My name is Becca Badger. I'm a
12-year partner at the SSC and I have a similar story of thanks. In 2004, I came to the
company and I was a young professional who thought I had all of the time in the
world to get a degree and I put it aside. And 10 years later, May 2014, I found myself
a single mom with two children. One of them has Down syndrome and require
additional support. And I saw all the time in the world slipped away. And then in
June of 2014, scholarship – the Starbucks College Achievement Plan was announced
and I knew hesitation was not an option because I've given the opportunity to
achieve the dream of a college degree.
And I started immediately, it was one of the ﬁrst classes, and I stand here before you
two and half years later, I ﬁnished my course work at the end of February.
I will confer in May and I'm the ﬁrst of my family to ﬁnish a college degree.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Fantastic.
And that, when I think about the equity in the company and what they can give back
to their partners and the beneﬁts that I've received from you over the last 12 years,
that's what I carry with me and that's the message I want you as shareholders to
understand, too, is that value is so much greater than just the few thousand dollars
that it took to get me there. But it's what I talk about and it's what I move forward
with, with my Starbucks journey.

Thank you, Becca.
Hello. My name is Sean Greenlee. I'm a District Manager, been with the company for
about three years. And I just want to follow up with what Saunjah was saying and
even Becca over there. Providing us space, yes, I understand, we all know the
criticality, we're a performance-driven company who lead through the lens of
humanity, but Starbucks truly provides us that space to do that. As a navy veteran,
socially conscious, biracial partner, I truly feel that the mission and values really
aligned with what I personally professionally stand for.
Recently and when I talk about Starbucks, giving us the opportunities to do what's
right when nobody else is looking, I was sent on a civil rights pilgrimage to represent
Starbucks down to the South. And it was amazing, transformative experience, one in
which helps me to better understand the social and the racial inequities that are
going on out there. And to be able to continue to provide partners those hands-on
opportunities and implement those social impact initiatives out in the stores so that
it's really real and it resonates with us will much more eﬀectively help us to be able to
translate that in the communities in which we serve. So, thank you.

Thank you.
Hi, I'm Kerry Suraj (01:39:01) and I'm a two-year partner part of Partner Resources.
And I love the thought behind these open forums and the transparency that we get
from it, and that's something that will stay with me forever, but one will rise to the top
of that and it was the impromptu forum that you hosted, Howard, immediately after
you announced the decision to pass on the reins to Kevin.
It was heartfelt, it was moving. But I found myself, even only being a two-year partner,
being so overcome with emotion and a rollercoaster. I think about why that was and
it's because I've had the opportunity to join Starbucks to have this opportunity not
only what it means for a company, but what it does for a community. I've chosen to
up route with the support of my husband and my two little girls. I moved from theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22

Page 27 of 47Kevin R. JohnsonMidwest here as I jumped at the opportunity for a role here, so I want to thank you
for that.
But I do have a question as I've since that time reﬂected and thought about the
range of emotions that the two of you have gone through and coming to this
decision in this historic time that your families have taken on. And I'm curious as I
work through my range of emotions, I can't even imagine your range of emotions
and I've a question for you in terms of, you know, are there a few words of wisdom
that you shared, Kevin, through this journey that you're comfortable sharing with a
few hundred thousand of your closest friends?
As you can see, this is completely unscripted. What Kevin and I have spoke about
privately and with the team is pretty simple when you think about trying to do the
right thing. And I shared with Kevin that for many, many years when we are in our
leadership team meeting and when we're in the board meeting, I try and
metaphorically think about two seats in the room that are empty. One is occupied by
a partner and one is occupied by a customer. And I try and be mindful of whatever
we are discussing and ultimately whatever we are going to decide, is that decision
going to make our partners and our customers proud.
And it's true that principle and purpose that has guided me and I know that has
guided Kevin in the last few years, and there's no doubt in my mind that we're not
perfect, we make some mistakes along the way, but the conscience and the heartfelt
commitment we have is trying to honor our customers and our partner and make
them proud of the decisions we make.
It's a pretty simple thing. Business can be very complicated, but when you reduce it
down to the lowest common denominator and that is our collective responsibility as
managers and leaders is to make our people better and proud and to do the same
thing with our customers. That's what we have to do. The rest is MOP.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
But you ask – you asked a bit about sort of the emotions that you go through. And I –
is it – shared in the video introduction that was showed today. At this point in my life,
I only want to spend my time on things that bring me joy with people I love. And so
that part of it is pretty simple. The harder part, though, is the fact that we've got an
iconic founder who's created this wonderfully beautiful place called Starbucks. And
there's a great sense of responsibility that I feel to you, to every partner in this
company, to our shareholders, to our customers and the communities we serve. And
at times, that can be a little intimidating, but what gives me comfort is the mission
and values of the guiding principles that got us to this point today are the same ones
that will guide us in the future.
The commitment of partners, all of you that I've met around the world give me great
conﬁdence that we're in this together, and the fact that still have Howard sitting in
the oﬃce next door, that's kind of comforting too.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22

Hi. My name is Deborah (01:43:40) and I'm the Store Manager in San Antonio, Texas.
I've been with the company for ﬁve years. My store was a veteran community store,
but now it's a military family store. And last September, I have a brother who is in the
Air Force currently, and last September, he suﬀers from PTSD, and he had an
attempted suicide. And I was – we were driving to SAMMC, the military hospital
down there in San Antonio, for exam, I remember looking at the building, the
surroundings and I knew, as much as I lost control because my brother was in there, I
knew I wasn't alone. But because of the programs that we have, the opportunities,
the volunteering that we have with the military, the USO, Mission Continues, I knew I
had it back at (01:44:27) people behind us, me and my family, to support us at
anytime that we needed them. And I'd like to tell you thank you, thank you very
much from the bottom of my heart for allowing those programs to happen here at

And mainly, I just want to say thank you to Howard. There are so many stories we
could all share about the amazing experiences we all have every day, but I just want
to thank Howard for his amazing vision of creating a company where we feel like we
belong. I know when I was in high school I always wanted to work for Starbucks, and
then my parents bought a restaurant and ruined all my dreams, temporarily, and I
moved after high school to Hawaii and didn't have a lot of my family or a lot of my
friends around and I was thousands of miles away. And I walked into a Starbucks
store and applied and instantly felt like I was supposed to be there.
I knew I belonged, I knew it was going to be my family. And now, being in Seattle at
Pike Place, eight years later, a little over eight years later, I feel like it's our job as
partners but especially at Pike Place to really create an environment where
everybody feels safe, everybody feels welcome, everybody feels like they belong,
whether it's a customer coming from all over the UK, from all over Japan, Korea,
wherever they're coming from, they're going to feel like they're family and they'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22

that's not enough and redoubles their eﬀorts.
Today, I'd like to mention another community of highly talented individuals who are
underrepresented in the workforce. There's 57 million Americans with disabilities in
our communities today, but sadly, only 20% are in the workforce compared to 68%
of their non-disabled neighbors. My question for you, and of course my fervent
hope, is that Starbucks can use our tremendous forces for good to ﬁnd a way to
create perhaps a new initiative to hire 10,000 Americans with disabilities. Thank you.

Well, thanks. Thanks for sharing your story, and certainly, we have many

people that we can probably do more for. I know, we've done a lot to welcome them
into our stores and to make the Starbucks experience easier. But perhaps, there's
much more we could do to bring them here as partners. Thank you.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Thank you. So I want to perform a special act right now. Kevin and I have had more
opportunities to discuss and celebrate the transition. It feels it's happened at least
ﬁve months ago. But this really is a special moment, and I wanted our partners to see
it. So, I have had one piece of Starbucks that has been in my pocket for almost 35
years. When I came to work at Starbucks, I worked in the Pike Place store, and more
than any other store in the world, we would not have a company without Pike Place,
it really deﬁnes everything we stand for. And what I had in my pocket for the last 30-
plus years was the key to the Starbucks store at Pike Place.
So, this morning, which I do every moment I can to go to Pike Place, but every annual
meeting, I start oﬀ at Pike Place. I asked Kevin to join me there this morning, we did
this earlier, but I want to do it in front of all of you, I am proud to give Kevin the key
to the company and to the Pike Place store.

It's already been quite a meeting. We're not done yet, though. As Kevin shared with
you earlier when he was in Ferguson, Missouri, opening our store there, I at the same
time was in South Africa opening our ﬁrst two stores in Johannesburg.
And can you show the photos of the Johannesburg store? You get to a market and
you get ready to open up stores, you really never know what to expect. But this is not
normal. This was a two-hour wait and it was pretty warm, and these lines have pretty
much continued. It was an incredibly successful opening in Johannesburg, and now
we're getting ready to open up in Cape Town as well.
But the opening in Johannesburg for me personally and emotionally was much more
than a opening of a market. Whenever we open up a market, I try and make myself
available to all the new partners who are going to wear the green apron for the ﬁrst
time, and spend some time with them, and really honor them and hear their
personal story.
What happened in Johannesburg was not a usual experience. I really heard the
stories of people living in townships and the poverty and the lack of opportunity and
the hopelessness of so many young people. And to my surprise, all 50 partners that
we hired for the two stores had never had a job before. This was their ﬁrst job. You
should've seen the joy on their face and the level of self-esteem that came with the
opportunity to represent Starbucks to their friends, their family, and obviously, to be
in front of a customer.
And as I was sitting down with them and hearing their stories, I kept hearing an
African word that I had never heard before, and it kept coming up time and time
again. And ﬁnally, I just said, you guys, you keep using a word I've never heard
before, what is it? The word is unbutu, unbutu (sic) [ubuntu]. It's a word that Nelson
Mandela used time and time again, and ﬁnally, I got up the courage to say, well, what
does it mean?
And they couldn't wait to just almost yell it out, Howard, it means I am because of
you. I am because of you. It has stuck with me for months, the word and its meaning.
The story of unbutu (sic) [ubuntu], coupled with the success that we have enjoyed in
South Africa throughout the Middle East, China, Asia Paciﬁc, Mexico and Central
America, all over Europe, and the universal acceptance of Starbucks now in 75
countries and everything you've seen today is why I'm so optimistic about the future
of our company.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22

Page 32 of 47Yet I realize more than ever before that we do not operate in isolation. We live in a
time that feels so fragile and so uncertain. We live in a time of increasing divisiveness
and betrayal, a little bit of time of rising nationalism and isolationistic rhetoric.
Unfortunately, we live in a time when hate and violence, both at home and abroad,
threaten our shared values. And I think we all know that none of us are immune to
this danger. And we long for ways in which we can help our families, our
communities and, yes, our country. I think we should be asking ourselves two
important questions. What is the core purpose and our reason for being and what
will it take to build a great and enduring America?
When I look back on the last 25 years, two truths are self-evident today as ever
before. Starbucks Coﬀee Company's success is rooted in the compassion and the
empathy our partner show to one and other and to our customers every day, and
you just saw it unscripted.
That humanity and generosity lifts all boats, and both have contributed to the
creation of a company far, far greater than anyone's expectations, not simply
because of the quality of our coﬀee or the design of our stores, but literally because
of the power of the human spirit, and the power of unbutu (sic) [ubuntu].
What we have achieved as a company in the past quarter century has not been an
accident. We have been guided by a set of strong core beliefs. We believe living our
values is where it all starts. We believe that access to learning is access to a better
life. We believe ﬁrst jobs are how youth opt in to the American dream and the
promise of America. We believe hiring veterans brings extraordinary talent into the
business. We believe doing good in the community is critical to doing business the
right way. We believe in opportunity, innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit. But
the belief that transcends all is our belief in our shared humanity.
What we've learned over these years at Starbucks is that it's always been about
walking in each other's shoes, demonstrating compassion, empathy and, yes, at
times, love. Despite the anger and political dysfunction that dominates the news and
our politics every day, we know there's a better America because we see it every day
in our stores with our partners and with our customers.
The student studying to become the ﬁrst in their family to graduate from college, the
entrepreneur writing a business plan inside our stores, the police oﬃcer sharing a
cup of coﬀee with community leaders, the volunteers readying for day of service and
people of diﬀerent faiths, races, sexual orientations and political beliefs coming
together in a respectful and civil dialogue, that's what makes me so optimistic about
the future of Starbucks and, more importantly, about the country we all love. To our
customers and shareholders, I thank you for your trust and support throughout all
these years. To the millions of partners who have proudly won the green apron at
Starbucks since 1971, I humbly say thank you. I am because of you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I am because of you; Starbucks is because of you;
and we are because of each other. Thank you and god bless you all. Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22

Based on that aﬃdavit, this meeting is duly called with timely and proper notice. In
addition, based on the information provided by Mr. Wilcox, a quorum of
shareholders is present today to conduct our meeting. Please note that a list of
shareholders as of the record date is available for your inspection by shareholders at

you wish to change your vote, you should deliver your ballot now to the Investor
Relations table on the back of the auditorium.
We will now proceed to the ﬁve proposals detailed in the proxy statement at this

order of business is the election of the director nominees is nominated by the board
who I just introduced to you. The board of directors recommends a vote for each of
the nominees.
The second item of business is the approval of an advisory resolution on executive
compensation. The board of directors recommends a vote for this proposal.
The third item of business is an advisory resolution on the frequency of future
advisory votes on executive compensation. The board of directors recommends an
annual vote regarding this proposal.
The fourth item of business is a ratiﬁcation of the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP
as the company's independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for the current
ﬁscal year ending October 1, 2017. The board recommends a vote for this proposal.
The ﬁfth and ﬁnal item of business is the shareholder proposal and supporting
statements submitted by Mr. James McRitchie, regarding an amendment to the
Starbucks' proxy access bylaw. I would now like to recognize Mr. Todd Paglia
(02:20:18), a representative of Mr. McRitchie, for a period of three minutes.
Mr. Paglia (02:20:25), would you please come to the microphone?
Thank you. I'm here to advocate for proposal ﬁve proxy access amendments. This
proposal asks the board to make three amendments to the company's proxy access
bylaws which allow shareholders holding 3% of shares or $2.4 billion continuously
for three years to nominate two directors and place their names on the proxy.
First, the proposal asks the shareholders be able to nominate 25% of the board
instead of 20%. We have seen what kind of numbers are required to make real
change happen on boards. Second, Starbucks' bylaws limit the number of
shareholders that can form a nominating group to 20. Each would have to hold an
average of $72 million in stock continuously for over three years, I emphasize
continuously.
As of the end of the last reporting period, there were 73 institutional investors that
held at least $120 million of stock, then only 53 for three consecutive years. Most of
these funds have never ﬁled a proxy proposal or participated in an activist campaign.
They're highly unlikely to ever join in nominating group regardless of the
circumstances. This proposal would allow for any or all of our companies more than
350 institutional investors that have held their shares with the years to form a
nominating group.
Third, current bylaws prohibit re-nomination of candidates receiving less than 25% of
the votes. There has never been a proxy access candidate at any company. Once thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22

candidates. It will take some time to elect proxy access candidates. This proposal
would remove the threshold for re-nomination. Proxy access at Starbucks today is
somewhat illusory.
Just as the word natural does not mean organic, proxy access at Starbucks does not
mean shareholders can actually nominate even a single director. Real proxy access
will drive a competition for ideas and talent among board candidates and create
direct accountability to us, the shareholders, a vote in favor of proposal ﬁve.
And I would also like to bring up an issue that many of us experienced coming into
this meeting today, which was somewhat disturbing. This is an incredible company, a
leader in so many diﬀerent progressive issues, and the protesters outside were
talking about the Starbucks cup, which is not recyclable still.

Your record of incredible progressive work. Costa announced today, the number two
coﬀee chain, that they're piloting a recyclable cup, the cup that Starbucks promised
to bring into its stores by 2015. So, I'm asking you, given all the amazing things that
this company has done, why is it still dragging its feet on living up to the promise of
delivering a recyclable cup that doesn't cost over 1 million trees per year. Where
Starbucks goes, the world will follow. Please make your cup recyclable. Thank you.

Respectfully, the board recommends a vote against this proposal for the reason set
forth in the company's proxy statement.

Q&A
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Perhaps, we'll take the cup question that was posed earlier as the ﬁrst question while
people come to the microphones. Look, I believe that there's no one doing more
than Starbucks to make our cups greener. Since. 2006, we introduced more than
10% of the content in our cups as post-consumer ﬁber. We've championed reusable
cups and created incentives for customers to use reusable cups. We've re-
engineered the lids and worked with recycling organizations around the world and
in the diﬀerent markets that we do business in.
Does that mean we could do more? Certainly. We're constantly working. And
sustainability is a big part of our mission and our agenda. But I think – and all due
respect to the way the question was framed, we think we have done quite a bit in the
industry to make our cups green, and we will continue to do more. Thank you.
Fellow shareholders and members of the board, my name is Bruce Speight

Q - Jan Dragochain by 2020. This commitment is signiﬁcant and valuable to shareholders and
customers.
Congratulations to Starbucks for taking an important leadership role on this issue.
The company's commitment comes at a crucial time when antibiotic resistance has
been named a global public health threat expected to kill 10 million people a year
by 2050. Starbucks' commitment oﬀers material value to the company and its
shareholders through mitigation of reputational and regulatory risk, innovation, in
adaptation to changing consumer preferences, and in upholding of company values.
With this commitment, Starbucks has joined a growing group of companies that has
moved to reduce the use of antibiotics in the meat supply chain, such as Panera,
Chipotle, McDonald's, Perdue Farms, and Tyson Foods. By acting now, we believe
that instead of lagging behind the industry and risking competitive disadvantage or
reputational damage, Starbucks is instead fortifying its brand value and market
share.
Starbucks' new commitment is also forward-thinking. Consumer preferences are
rapidly changing to favor sustainable and safe foods. From 2011 to 2015, antibiotic-
free meat sales grew over 28%, while conventional meat sales grew less than 5%.
Starbucks' commitment demonstrates the company's ability to innovate in response
to shifting market conditions, diﬀerentiating itself in an otherwise highly competitive
market.
And ﬁnally, Starbucks' antibiotic policy demonstrates a commitment to the
company's core values of oﬀering responsibly produced, high quality, and
sustainable products, upholding existing consumer trust and brand respect.
To summarize, antibiotic misuse in agriculture is a major contributor to one of the
most pressing public health crises of our time. As a concerned investor, Green
Century thanks Starbucks for its leadership, foresight, and commitment to creating
shareholder value and protecting the health of all consumers. We look forward to
continuing to work with Starbucks on this issue. Thank you.

{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Thank you.
Hi. Good morning. I'm Justin Danhof, from the National Center for Public Policy
Research. In response to President Trump's ﬁrst Executive Order on immigration, Mr.
Schultz, you wrote very publicly, "With a heavy heart, we are witness to the
conscience of our country and the promise of the American dream being called into
question." And that's of course when you announced plans to hire 10,000 refugees
over the next ﬁve years.
However, according to Business Insider, since that announcement, "Starbucks brand
has taken a beating." Starbucks said it would focus on hiring refugees, who have
served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel. While that sounds
noble, it's also interesting because ABC News reported that in 2011, after discovering
two Al Qaeda members with links to Iraq operating in Kentucky, the State
Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months. Even for many who
had heroically helped U.S. forces as interpreters and intelligence assets. One Iraqi
refugee, who had aided U.S. troops, was assassinating during this President Obama
and Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, travel ban. Where was your heavy heart then?
The media didn't even report on the Obama and Clinton travel ban until 2013, two
years later. Starbucks didn't seem to have anything to say about it then either. I have
two quick questions. I understand that, as you said, not every decision is based onFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 40 of 47A - Howard S. Schultzeconomics, but economics are a hard reality. So, the ﬁrst question is, how much will
Starbucks investors have to spend, so that the company can properly vet refugees
that the Federal Government admits it can't always aﬀord to vet. And why were you
willing to have Starbucks reputation take a beating by attacking President Trump's
executive order, when you lack the courage to speak out against the Obama-Clinton
travel ban?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Let me try and answer the two questions and remove the rhetoric from questions. If
there is one message that I think I hope you came away with today is that none of the
things that we have tried to do as a company, which is based on humanity and
compassion, is based on politics, but it's based on principle and our core beliefs,
which I've tried to really outline very speciﬁcally.
First oﬀ, on the issue of brand dilution or anything happening as a result of our
business with regard to the 10,000 hiring of refugees globally, I can unequivocally
tell you, and we all know this from the research we've done, that there is zero,
absolutely no evidence whatsoever, that there's any dilution in the integrity of the
Starbucks' brand reputation or our core business as a result of being compassionate.
You keep referencing President Obama versus President Trump. This is not about
politics. And there's no additional cost to Starbucks as a result of vetting. But when
you do have people who have defended the nation and saved lives in very, very
unsafe areas as interpreters helping American soldiers, we strongly believe that we
have a moral obligation to help them transition back into United States. Thank you
very much.
Next question?
Thanks, Howard. Congratulations on the birth of your grandson and on the new
challenges that I'm sure will keep making Starbucks an even greater company.
Congratulations, Kevin, on the venti shoes to ﬁll. But from everything we've heard
today, I'm very sure that you're going to carry the torch and pick up the mantle on
the wonderful corporate culture that Starbucks enjoys.
My name is Claudio Brocado (02:35:52). I'm a stock – global stock portfolio
manager, who used to manage funds for Fidelity and other global organizations.
Over my long career, I invested in hundreds of companies. Starbucks, I've been
fortunate to be an early shareholder of Starbucks and I never sold my shares and that
allowed me to retire early. So, thanks, again.
In reading your books, Howard, one of the things that really inspire me is that you
really have walked the walk. And you really have led by example, and been through
to the company's values, and I agree with you that Wall Street needs to put more
value on values. So, in the long run – there's some debate as to whether companies
should be for shareholder interest.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22

Q - Howard S. Schultz
A - Kevin R. JohnsonI think you're living proof that in the long run, which is what really matters, the
interest of all stakeholders converged, the way you treat partners and – reﬂects how
they treat customers, which generates a lot of business and the growth that we've
been experiencing as shareholders. So, all of our stakeholder interest really
converge. So, I applaud the fact that all Starbucks' employees get stock. Also, the
success of the rewards program shows that rewards members, as you've showed us,
increase the value of the business for Starbucks.
So, my question is and my suggestion is why not make more consumers
shareholders of Starbucks? I know that there are headaches that would be involved
in managing such a program would be very big. But there's this new company called
Stockpile that allows even fractional ownership of stock. So, you could give rewards
members, certiﬁcates...
Okay, I think we got it.

Hi. My name is Erin Myolo (02:39:46). I am coming on three years as a partner, and
I'm at the Reserve Roastery & Tasting Room in Seattle. First, I need to very quickly, I
promise, thank you, Howard. If it wasn't for the social practices and the treatment of
your partners that you'd implement, I would have never applied to Starbucks. And if I
hadn't, I would have never met a man named Anthony (02:40:13) back in
Connecticut in my original store, and had him join me ﬂying out here for the

you.
My completely unrelated question. Last year, I stepped forward and asked about
introducing more information about our C.A.F.E. Practices to customers and making
that information more accessible rather than just having a single page on 1912 Pike,
and a few other smaller pieces. And I know there's been a lot of development with
the Roasterys and everything else. So, wanted to ask if that was something on either
of your platters that was planning to be a little more forward in your implementation.

Hi. My name is Adam (02:41:45), and I am a former partner, current shareholder. I'm
actually here today with Kristen (02:41:52) right behind me on behalf of Working
Washington. And building on the question that was asked in the impromptu open
forum regarding paid family leave, I wanted to just quickly tell my story where I
moved to Seattle from Dallas, Texas, four-and-a-half years ago for my previous job at
Starbucks. And in less than a year, my now-wife and I had discovered we were going
to become parents.
And at that time, with the paid family leave – or excuse me, with the family leave
policy, we determined that me taking time oﬀ was simply not going to be an option.
It would create too much ﬁnancial strain. So, in light of that, I do, like the woman on
stage, think it's worth commending Starbucks for taking a step in the right direction
of trying to oﬀer paid family leave, that I think a company of this size to be doing
that, it's really a huge step and I appreciate that from what I'm seeing is there's a
dialogue opening up about what is the path forward for this policy. And I'm kind of
curious to hear more about that.
Perhaps, I think Kristen (02:43:10) can put it in a little bit of context well. She's a
current partner.
Hi. My name is Kristen Piccolo (02:43:16). I am current partner in Medina, Ohio. And
I'm a new mom. My son is four months old. And I ﬂew to Seattle because I know as a

now, the in-store partners are not included in the new paid parental policy. And I just
want you to maybe reconsider and extend this crucial beneﬁt to all employees.

Certainly, we are a company that has always been very creative and innovative in the
way we provide beneﬁts to our partners, beginning with healthcare for part-time

decisions we had to make. One of which was a signiﬁcant increase in wage for ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-22

A - Howard S. Schultzretail partners, along with an enhancement to our healthcare beneﬁts for the private
exchange, which has saved partners millions of dollars in healthcare.
And so, in making those decisions, we also juggled the decision around parental
care or parental leave. And we made the decision to enhance parental leave for our
retail partners by providing 100% paid for the six-week period. The same is that we
had for our non-retail partners. And then, for the 12-week period following that, we
had to make a hard decision in terms of how to prioritize where we were getting
feedback from our partners. And that's where we ended up providing our retail
partners the unpaid leave option that allows their healthcare to continue and
everything else while they spend that time.
That said, we are always taking feedback from partners, and this was just one point in
time as we had to make a set of decisions. And I understand Ron Crawford and our
Beneﬁts organization had a very good dialogue with you and your feedback and
your perspective was very helpful. So thank you so much for sharing your story for
the question.

Month of Service and give it visibility year round. And I really do think it's one of
those things that has led to my Starbucks addiction. I sometimes tell stories, a short
version of it is that one time I was planting trees, and I looked over, and there was
Cliﬀ (02:47:26) with a shovel doing the same thing right next to me. And it's amazing
that you give back at every single level.
There's a Subway guy who lives in the same community, me and Cliﬀ (02:47:39)
planting trees. And I would like to see the website where people volunteer to have
more visibility and the Global Month of Service have visibility, and maybe even a few
more relationships with the Mission Continues, which is such a great organization
and also does community service right here in our community.
Melody (02:48:00), we'll take that under consideration. Thank you very much for
your support at Starbucks. Thank you. You have the last question, sir. Last question.
Thank you. And this is for Kevin. So, getting back to the cup issue from an innovation
point of view because I know you like innovation. So, when Starbucks was in its big
drive to solve the cup issue, which you identiﬁed as a major problem, you may have
been less involved. And in fact, the cup that is fully recyclable, which is made by
Smart Planet Technologies, which I have no ﬁnancial interest in, wasn't invented until

Yes. Well, ﬁrst of all, I'm just blown away by this experience. Over 14 years ago, I was

when I was very impetuous, risk taking, and impulsive. I grew up in a very negative

Page 47 of 47When I came out of prison at age 26, I had a dream and hopes to recreate my life
and start anew. I had a bachelor's degree that I earned in prison, and I thought it will
be easy. Organization after organization, job after job, many stores have denied me
an opportunity because of my criminal conviction. Many people chose to judge me
based upon the single worst thing I had ever done.
But one day, I was given an opportunity to walk into a Starbucks store on the South
Side, Chicago, where I grew up. When I walked in, I sat down with the store manager
who looked at me in my eye and said, Xavier (02:51:54), I'm not going to judge you
based upon what you did in the past. I'm going to judge you based on who you are
today and what you aspire to be.
Because of that opportunity, I was able to go to school part-time and earn a master's
degree. Because of that opportunity to work as a barista, a proud barista, I was able
to continue on in advancing my career and becoming a Juvenile Justice Diversion
Program Coordinator, becoming a Clinical Research Interviewer with Northwestern,
and now working with a national campaign as leading the eﬀort to end Life Without
Parole for kids in the justice system.
Just last week, we heard that Arkansas, because of our eﬀort, has chose to abolish

made it possible. Thank you.
