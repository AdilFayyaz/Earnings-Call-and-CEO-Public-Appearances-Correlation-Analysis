Wow, what a day. What a day. We are oﬀ to an incredible start, especially with
Microsoft here with us. Before we get started with everything, thanks so much for
your support. I think this is turning out to be an incredible conference. I'm told this is
the largest Goldman Sachs Investor Conference ever. It certainly feels that way and
your energy, your enthusiasm, your participation is greatly appreciated. And all that
is possible only if you've got good content and so that we owe you for the content.
I'm just here asking the questions and you're going to generate a ton of insights.
Judson, why don't you introduce yourself? You've got a big title, I'm told, from some
of my contacts that you are a rising star at Microsoft. Tell us about your
responsibilities and then we'll jump into some questions.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Thanks, Kash. Look, I am responsible for Microsoft's Commercial business, which is a
fancy way of saying I'm responsible for everything we sell, service and support to our
large corporate enterprise customers, all the way down to small, medium-end
businesses and governments around the world. And I've been with Microsoft now a
little over nine years. Over the time I've been at the company, largely responsible for
our go-to-market strategy, our sales force and our delivery teams around the world.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
Got it. And I happen to -- you guys should all check it out, there is this YouTube
video. You are the star of the show and you talked a lot about how you plan to
approach ﬁscal '23 with your partners. It's called Inspire '23. Is that Inspire '23?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

Right.
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
I got to tell you, I felt ﬁred up after watching that Youtube video and he is the star of
the show and you introduced your industry heads and they bring in their customers
whatnot.
So despite the looming uncertainty with the macro, et cetera, you guys sound you
were bullish and I thought, okay, man these guys are bullish and then Satya comes
over after you and he sounds equally bullish. What's going on in Microsoft? Why --
you put up good numbers. From your seat, what we've been seeing with respect to
demand trends, the nature of customer conversations that makes you so bullish
about the future?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Well, thank you for calling all of that out and thank you for the kind words. Look, a
big headline underneath Microsoft Inspire this year was this notion of digital
perseverance. And we made a big point of talking to our customers about the need
to pivot from resiliency to perseverance. Obviously, navigating the pandemic was all
about frankly getting through it. And we helped customers with a lot of technology
that help them survive the pandemic. And this pivot from resiliency is about moving
from surviving to thriving.
Resiliency is basically a fancy word for what do you do when bad things happen to
you. Perseverance is a little bit more forward looking and how do you think about
planning for the future, which resonates right now in these uncertain times. And the
reality of the situation is I think a lot of people thought they would come out of the
pandemic to blue skies and rainbows that obviously hasn't happened. The economic
environment is arguably the most uncertain we've seen in decades. And to me, the
only way to navigate uncertainty is continued and accelerated innovation.
So we're pretty excited about that because we believe the Microsoft Cloud is the
most comprehensive and trusted cloud in the industry. And we also think that it is,
frankly, the spend less do more cloud, which comes at a very opportune time for us.
If you think about it macro level, customers right now are still trying to solve the
same problems they were trying to solve before this economic crisis unfolded. CEOs
are trying to thread the needle on productivity and employees satisfaction. They're
trying to get a grips with their supply chain and ﬁnd some level of resiliency and
predictability in their supply chain. We've got to solve the world's sustainability
challenges and every CEO is being asked what they're doing for net zero.
And then on top of that, cybercrime is on the rise. The bad guys aren't slowing down
and so threats are coming from everywhere, even nation states. And preparing your
enterprise to be able to tackle those things is a very diﬃcult -- very diﬃcult thing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 16Q - Kash Rangan
A - Judson Althoﬀ
Q - Kash RanganAnd so all of that happens on top of having to ﬁnd a way to solve for it, while
spending less money. And we feel like technology has a role most certainly and if
technology has a role Microsoft most deﬁnitely has a role.
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
Yeah. We'll dig into the speciﬁcs of that. But I do -- and we were talking about it
when we caught up in before the group meeting, something to the eﬀect that there
is inﬂationary forces in the economy, but tech is deﬂationary. That's something that
Satya Nadella talks about on the conference call. Help -- if you don't mind level set
as on what is the implication of what you guys have been talking about? Tech is
deﬂationary. The economy is going to inﬂation. What can you do at a super high
level for the economy, because you're $200 billion revenue company, you're big and
have inﬂuence in all corners of the economies? If you don't mind dig into that
statement, a little bit and tell us what it means?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Sure. Well, look, we are still in the very infancy of the digital age in terms of real
technology adoption. And what I mean when I say that is despite the progress you've
seen by a lot of the companies that invest in the cloud and SaaS companies, the
adoption curve across enterprises in a way that every person has a unique
opportunity to participate in the digital economy is still very nascent. Strictly
speaking, the frontlines aren't connected to the boardroom, in most cases. And we
believe we have technology that can really change that.
Teams, most of you know it as a tool for voice, video and persistent chat. Teams for
us is a platform, platform and socket for future innovation that has the ability to take
information that you otherwise might just have at the core distributed down to the
front lines and at the front lines in turn provide a digital feedback loop to your
boardroom. That democratized experienced, technology bringing new eﬃciency
and at the same time, simpliﬁcation to business models is a massive opportunity that
is really, frankly, only in its infancy of being tapped.
You can talk about it in that sense. You can also talk about it in terms of industry, real
industry adoption of digital capabilities by vertical. How ﬁnancial services companies
operate? How health care institutions connect physicians to patients? All once again
still in its infancy. And so technology can of course make those processes more
eﬃcient and optimize them and bring more people into the fold so that all have an
opportunity. So in fact, you talked about it being a deﬂationary force, technology can
lower the cost and make more eﬃcient just about any business process you can
conceive.
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
Got it. So in an environment where ﬁnancing costs are going higher because of
higher rates whatnot. The fact that tech actually makes money from our perspective,
should hold us in good stead right? And that was the point that our Chief Economist,
Jan Hatzius was making in the morning at 7:30. He calls for a soft landing and we did
ask him about the role of technology in GDP improvement. He is deﬁnitely more
optimistic than you would imagine.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

Q - Kash RanganAnd Judson, looking at a little bit more big picture, lot of our clients have been
thinking about where we are in cloud adoption, digital transformation. Are you
seeing any changes with CIO budgets? Has anything changed with respect to
appetite for IT in your conversations?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yeah, sure. Look, I think that the current climate will pressure the conversation
around any digital eﬀort and I believe actually for the right reasons, because I think
some of the early-stage digital initiatives were largely predicated on this notion that
anything in the cloud must be better. So move whatever you have from wherever it is
right now to the cloud and good things will happen. And so I think any good
conversation with the CFO will sort of stimulate the pressure on real digital
transformation versus a sort of cloud window washing. So...
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
Cloud window washing. I like that.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
So where do we -- where we see opportunities there. Well, once again, I come to the
strength of the portfolio that we have, of course, we have a really strong cloud
platform. We look at the cloud platform itself Azure as serving three communities,
developers, infrastructure teams and data and AI teams. On the developer side,
we've seen tremendous strength in adoption there, the GitHub acquisition is help.
Even our competitors use our tool chain. And so the developers use and love your
tool chain, they're most likely -- or its more likely to deploy on your platform.
On the core infrastructure side, I think we've gotten ahead of some of the
sovereignty challenges that exist around the world in the reverse globalization trend.
And we've invested in hybrid capabilities there that make for a lasting solutions. And
then on the data side, we have a very broad portfolio that extends from our existing
SQL Server-based and customers have a lot of their data dependency on Microsoft
already. So if we can help them modernize that move into the cloud in a way that
they can use AI to reason over it and get real business beneﬁt out of it. We can
provide digital strategies that really drive outcomes for businesses. And those are
the ones that I think are going to pass that CO [ph] test, if you will. So we're the best-
of-suite cloud, if you think about it.
If you look at what's in the Microsoft Cloud, you'd need the best of AWS, the best of
Google, the best Sales Force, the best of Zoom, the best Okta, the best CrowdStrike.
And you'd have to hope like hell that some integrator wove that together for you
perfectly to get what you can get from the Microsoft Cloud. So we're going to do all
of these things and we're going to lower customer spend and increase our share at
the same time.
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
So I'm glad you didn't say the best of Goldman Sachs in that, so that would have
been a concerning thing. But I did want to ask you a little bit about de-globalization.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

Page 5 of 16A - Judson Althoﬀ
Q - Kash Rangan
A - Judson Althoﬀ
Q - Kash RanganWhat can Microsoft help customers with respect to onshoring de-globalization?
Because I thought that was a bit of a negative but you make it sound like it -- you
could do something for these customers.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Well, look, I guess, yeah, I should be clear and ﬁrm, like I don't personally love
reverse globalization. I think a lot has been gained in society by having the world
think of itself as a connected place and where I think we're kind of all citizens of the
planet at the end of the day. So I don't love the trend. But if you look at the fact of
the matter, our customers have to navigate it. Our customers have to navigate
operating in a multinational sense and having their data and operations distributed
around the world. And so we've had to really think through, how do you do that
eﬀectively. And so we've invested in EU data boundaries, so that if you're operating
in the EU, your data stays within EU. We support and care for your business in the EU
within the sanctity of EU boundaries.
We've invested in conﬁdential compute and encryption capabilities that you can
operate on the data in an encrypted sense. We've worked with governments like
France and Germany and Singapore on truly software and air-gapped capabilities for
more stringent scenarios, also in China where some of the policies are more rigid in
terms of what's allowed to be mobile and not all whilst at the same time still trying to
leverage cloud scale economics, which is a shared principle, if you think about it.
And so that's an investment we made over this last year that I feel pretty good about
in terms of us being ready for where the world is headed, whether we like where the
world is headed or not. I mean our job at the end of the day is to provide enabling
and empowering technology to help our customers succeed in the current business
climate and that's why we've done what we've done.
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
That's great. So you've got the most expansive -- you've got the most expansive
commercial product portfolio at Microsoft. It's dizzying in terms of what it can do.
LinkedIn, Microsoft 365, Azure, those are like multi, multi-billion dollar business, multi
tens of billions of dollars of businesses. Whether it's that big, how do you build
synergies across these products? And how do you even cross-sell? It sounds like an
insurmountable task of monumental complexity. How do you do this?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
No, it's a fantastic question actually. And it's actually one works really, I think
spending some time on for this audience because like this came up as well as on a
run of the roundtable. So I apologize in advance that anybody who was in there it
would be a boring answer for you, because...
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
Nothing is boring. You are a good speaker.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

Page 6 of 16A - Judson Althoﬀ

But, look, I think we've trained you all to think about our business in solution areas
and where our competitors lineup, whether that be our modern work portfolio, our
business applications portfolio, the solution areas that operate across our cloud
platforms, across data, infrastructure and developer and our cyber business. And
we're competitive in all of those and well integrated in all of them.
But our real power comes in, what we can do when we bring those assets together
for a customer. And so, even in our go-to-market approach, we have a consultative
engagement model and methodology that we teach our people that eﬀectively has
us selling into every room of the house that the customer has in order to create
integrated value chains.
I'll give you a good example. I mean Coca-Cola is a very good customer of ours
across not only the central entity, but also the 250 distributed bottlers around the
world. And I think it's because we've been able to do great work to establish a
technology framework to build synergies between what they do on their cloud
platform and how that connects with folks in their daily lives. And so we talk about
that in the form of business applications that are connected to Teams in ways in
which you can collaborate in Teams connect it back to your business process. And
that integrated value is something that's really quite unique to the Microsoft Cloud
that our competitors really can't provide in terms of diﬀerentiation. So the more that
we provide those synergies across the rooms in the house to deliver more integrated
value, the more relevant we become to our customers.
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
And that's how -- and customers, do customers see it that way the way you're
explaining it? Or more customers are going to see it the way you're explaining?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
(Multiple Speakers) They do. But look, I think the opportunity here is for us to make
sure that business value is being realized with every technology investment that is
made. And the portfolio certainly helps us in that regard. But the industry focus
we've had investing in verticals, we've invested in ﬁnancial services, health care,
manufacturing, sustainability. We've invested in defense and intelligence for public
sector, education and public services. And our vertical solutions really helped to wire
together all of the assets that we have in a way that they make more tangible sense
for our customers. But they don't have to do that wiring.
Take the health care example, right? I could show up at a health care institution and
say, hey, let me talk to you about Teams and collaboration or I can show up and say,
hey, let me help you with patient-physician engagement and creating richer and
more lasting wellness programs for the patients for whom you care. And the Nuance
acquisition we made is a very clean example of that because we can provide AI
solutions to strengthen that relationship to get to a deeper understanding of
prognosis of the patient, leverage the longitudinal care record and all of the data
that we have an Azure to drive better wellness outcomes than ever before. So it'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

Page 7 of 16Q - Kash Rangan

Q - Kash Ranganabout composing those solutions that operate horizontally in a vertical way to create
more value for our customers.
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
Got it. Excellent. What could go wrong here? What could be the roadblocks and
problems with digital transformation?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Well, look, I think the problems that everyone faces today around skill shortage. And
pressures on budgets are very real. And so it's our job to kind of help customers
navigate that. It's one of the reasons why we've invested so much in skilling. You
mentioned LinkedIn earlier, I mean we do really believe in this notion of workplace
health trends and helping people continue to amass their skills and modernize their
skills to meet the demands of society. And so we're deeply invested in that. So skills
is deﬁnitely a hurdle that every customer has to overcome in order to get to that end
state.
And we encourage and invest in strong skilling and re-skilling plans to make sure
that we're helping people there. And one example would be the low-code no-code
platform that we have that we call hope Power Apps. Eﬀectively, if you can make a
PowerPoint presentation, you can make a Power App. And we've done things like
show up at a factory ﬂoor and run a Power Apps clinic for 26,000 frontline workers.
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
Yeah. It's Allison Taylor, right? I mean she's still still doing the...
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Exactly. So you can teach people that actually understand the process ﬂow and the
business ﬂow better than anyone else because they're on the front lines and teach
them how to use citizen dev capabilities to build the solutions that they take on. You
can overcome that skills gap. But it's a very real one. The budget gap is one as well.
And look, here's where we make a lot of forward-looking investments in our
customers.
If you think about even our fourth quarter earnings call, we talked about record
number of nine ﬁgure and 10-ﬁgure deals. With every one of those deals and the
strategic framework comes in investment plan where Microsoft leverages its balance
sheet to invest in resources to help with the migration and invest in dollars for
partners to come help drive acceleration and innovation. And so helping customers
with that, helping customers accelerate the pace of innovation, that's going to be the
key for us in this coming year.
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. I'm going to do a quick pulse check. I always keep the mic so far away
from me. Quick pulse check to see if anybody has any questions. If you do, just raise
your hand, we'll try to -- it's not even possible for me to see the raised handsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

Q - Analyst
A - Judson Althoﬀ
Q - Analyst
A - Judson Althoﬀbecause there's so many of us here. Pardon me if I'm missing any raised hands.
Okay, there you go.
Could you talk a little bit about the ecosystem and where it is and how you see that
evolving over the next ﬁve to six years?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
The enterprise ecosystem, again?
Yes.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Can you give me a little bit more?
Just looking to partners. But you talked about verticalization and other ways that
you're addressing parts of the enterprise. To what extent, I mean, obviously, a huge
extent that Microsoft looks to an ecosystem, but where is it and where do you see it
going?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yeah, sure. So super important for us because fundamentally, we are a partner-
oriented company, right? And so you can look at this across two major horizontal
dimensions and then sort of strike it vertically. Horizontally speaking, we're working
on building the skills and capacity base across the systems integrator ecosystem,
either the large globals like the centers and EYs and KPMGs and PwCs of the world
or the smaller local players that focus in a given geography. We're really deeply
invested in building their skills out across our cloud platform to help them further
advance customers. So it's a big deal for us because transparently, we don't look to
build our own services organization to be any larger than it already is today. And we
do sort of tip of the spear work, we'll prime large digital transformations, but we
really want that ecosystem to ﬂourish. So we invest richly in it.
The second dimension is across the IP base and it's broad and expansive as the
Microsoft Cloud portfolio is. We'll never be all things to all people especially when it
comes to the verticals. And so in each vertical, there are ISVs that matter more to our
customers and health care is the Epics and Cerners of the world and manufacturing,
it's everyone from the PTCs to the Rockwells to the Siemens of the world and making
sure that they have deep integrations into our portfolio, and that those integrations
are more seamless for our customers are critical because it kind of comes full circle
back to the adoption curve that we talked about just a moment ago. The more
software-oriented these solutions can be, the more frictionless their adoption can beFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

Page 9 of 16Q - Kash Rangan

A - Judson Althoﬀand so the forward investments we make in the same are critical to our success. But
we're deeply, deeply focused on ecosystem health.
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
Thank you. Any other question before I -- please go ahead.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Can we get you a microphone?
Okay. Thank you so much. So thank you for your time. So the ﬁrst one, everybody
companies today's talk more about the multicloud strategy, yes. And I'm saying the
strategy -- Microsoft's strategy is very open to interoperability in terms of
infrastructure, in terms of the partners, something like that. How do you think in
terms of the strategy for the next years in terms of that? Multicloud and
interoperability with the other's cloud, something like that?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yeah. Look, the number one thing for us is to serve the customer, right, and to meet
the customer where they are. And so of course, that means that as much as we try to
provide pervasive value across the Microsoft cloud, customers will make decisions
that are non-Microsoft decisions, and we need to still serve their needs, and we have
an accountability to make them successful. And so whether that means that you may
see data running in one cloud, then applications running in another and having
strong interoperability there. We're committed to taking our customers successful in
that regard.
And you've seen that even in some of the new technology portfolio that we've
released. For example, our security portfolio runs across cloud. Our incident and
event management solution. We call it Sentinel, operates across AWS, across Google
Cloud Platform and across Azure and across a customer's on-prem environment
because we know that if we want to commit to securing that infrastructure, we've got
to do it across the totality of their environment.
And like we've also made very bold partnerships in market. SAP is our largest
partner. We also have a portion of our portfolio that competes with SAP. We most
recently announced a very unique partnership with Oracle. None of the other
hyperperscale cloud companies have a relationship with Oracle. We have a model
with them where you can run applications on Azure and directly connect back into
the Oracle Cloud infrastructure for your data environment. And it's a unique
engineering partnership as well as a unique go-to-market partnership.
So we've demonstrated pretty openly that we're committed to heterogeneous
standards and helping our customers really because that's what it's all about. They'll
never be as much, to my chagrin, there'll never be a single customer that is 100%
Microsoft. And so if we're here to try to advance their success.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

Yeah. Well, even there, we use some tech from our partners. But at the end of the

third-party technology inside of Microsoft. So it would be crazy for us to assume that
some customers might not. But look, we're dedicated to it. We resource it. We have -

with companies that compete with us. So we think it's a key part of making our

{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
Judson, I'm curious, I mean this is something that just came to mind here. If you have
and if you're willing to share your perspectives on the data, database, data analytics,
data warehousing segment of the software universe. I know Satya has called out how
Cosmos DB is on ﬁre, triple-digit growth rate, that sort of thing. What is happening
on the Microsoft data ecosystem? Can you give us your perspective what to read into
what's happening with data warehousing, databases, unstructured data, structured
data, RDBMS, document databases? So many things that are happening. It's
fascinating to be the database market has gotten the slowest growth market in
software to the fastest growth market in software? What's happened? What is
Microsoft's stake there?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
I spent a lot of time in databases in my life, so I feel reasonably qualiﬁed to answer
that question. Look, ﬁrst of all, I'm glad customers are investing in data strategies
more so now than we've seen in the last several years, and I feel like we are well
positioned to help them. And I say it that way because a good question came up in
one of my breakout sessions earlier today around the future of analytics and AI. And
I think customers are realizing that if you expect AI to empower your business or to
somehow improve a workﬂow inside of your organization or somehow improve how
you engage with your customers, the ﬁrst thing you have to get right is your data
strategy, because no system can be any more intelligent than the data over which it
reasons.
If you don't invest in your data strategy and you put tons of money into your AI
strategy, all you're going to do is make mistakes with more conﬁdence than ever
before. So like data as a foundation matters. Microsoft's fairly uniquely positionedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

Page 11 of 16Q - Kash Rangan
A - Judson Althoﬀ
Q - Kash Rangan
A - Judson Althoﬀhere because we do have such a massive relational customer base with SQL Server.
We have leading socket share there and even leading revenue share there. And so
helping our customers migrate that data to -- that estate to the cloud with the
intentionality of getting value out of it, right? And sort of value-driven cloud
migration with the notion of impacting business outcomes, super key.
You mentioned Cosmos DB which is a multimodal multi-master database for cloud-
native applications. Walmart depends upon it, for example, to run their e-commerce
environment and it's the largest of any kind in the world. And it eﬀectively allows you
to have a self-healing, self-scaling database of enormous global scale at really a
lower cost structure than you would have seen with the traditional Oracle Exadata
environment.
And then on the analytics side...
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
Did they switch from Exadata to Cosmos DB running the cloud?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
(Multiple Speakers) The third piece of the stool though is the analytic warehouse,
right? And so here with Synapse, we have growing strengths there, a lot of
customers adopting Synapse. But across the data chasm, we also have strong
partnerships back to the question earlier. We have a great partnership with Oracle.
We have a great partnership with Databricks, a great partnership with Mongo and a
great partnership with Snowﬂake.
Our aim here is to help customers harness their data estate and really see it from the
operational side through to the analytical side so that they can reason over it to drive
better outcomes. That will manifest itself in business opportunity for Microsoft and
for our partners. But most importantly, it will manifest itself in better outcomes for
our customers.
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
Yeah. No, that's -- it's a great perspective. But I was curious, what's happening to the
former most starchy piece of the software market now turned the most active,
vibrant, and I really gained from that perspective that you had to share with us.
Moving on to unless there aren't any raised hands. I want to move on to -- if I can just
ﬁnish my question, and I'll come to you because I'm thinking right through it here.
We'll come to you in a second. Microsoft 365. Quite a few of us have been using
Teams, maybe all the time or some of the time. What are you doing with the Teams
product? Where are you investing in the functionality? And what are you telling your

platform not just a tool for voice, video and chat. And we see a rich opportunity for
customers to think about a new generation of applications that we call collaborative
applications that can bring new value to any kind of distributed workﬂow across their
enterprise. If you think about it, the art and science of eﬃciency is coming together
and aggregating multiple ideas and perspectives into one common ﬂuid execution
machine. And with Teams as a platform, we can really bring that to life, and we're
doing this in really three ways, you can think of it.
First, you'll see us create our own ﬁrst-party collaborative applications. We just
launched the ﬁrst of these in Veeva sales. We announced it a couple of months ago.
It's GA, October 2. But Veeva sales is a customer engagement platform that sits on
top of any system of record, even Salesforce, and allows you to collaborate on a
customer engagement. It's inclusive of Customer 360 data, next best action,
objection handling, sentiment analysis that leverages AI across the data that you
have about your customer to better serve your customer. And it's all brought
together with Teams as the UX. Teams is the operating system, if you will.
So it's a new socket of growth for Microsoft. It's also a new canvas for developers
and ISVs to paint upon. So you see companies like Workday and ServiceNow and
Adobe, creating new application extensions for Teams, not just like here's my app
inside of Teams, but actually new workﬂows and new distributed ways of
collaborating inside of Teams that unlocks value for the customer.
So great value for the customer because they get inherent value out of increased
collaboration interaction and the data-driven ways in which they can empower their
employees in a quantiﬁable way because we also measure that outcome through
Veeva Insights. Great opportunity for partners to build new collaborative applications
on the Teams scaﬀolding and, of course, expanded suite value for Microsoft and
more value out of Teams for our customers. Of course, we'll pay back in dividends
for share gains for Microsoft.
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
Yeah. I noticed in your Inspire speech, you had some scenarios where Teams
integrates with GitHub capabilities. So all the collaboration extends out to the
developer, not just the...
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
The developers are working in that same collaborative environment to become more
and more productive.

Q - Kash Rangan
A - Judson AlthoﬀSo I want to position this question in a way that you'll answer it. So a lot of pretty
older industrial companies weren't sort of built with having a smooth IT operation,
let's say. Does -- at some point, the cloud business become chunkier and sort of --
and more sort of expensive to manage as you deal with these older -- sort of the low-
hanging fruit in a way? And then as some of these older companies, it becomes a
huge -- really heavy lift to get stuﬀ on to the cloud and to really do that. Is that --
because it seems like you're in the position it is really in a usual position where a
company as big as you is growing as fast as you.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yeah. So two or three ways to think about it, maybe. I will always profess that if all
you're going to do with the cloud is take what you have and move out of your data
center and into the cloud, it is a bad idea. It just is. You might gain a little bit because
server and storage utilization in the cloud is more eﬀective than server and storage
utilization in your data center. But the real gains you get from innovation will not
happen until you think about how to leverage digital capability in a more
diﬀerentiated way to drive your own business outcomes.
So certainly, if you are in that sort of dodgy industrial base and tunnel vision IT and
saying, well, okay, let's just move out of the data center and into the cloud, there's
not going to be a lot of progress there, and you will have limited on productivity
gains and real scale there.
I think though that if you look at the opportunity to reinvent and rethink how those
organizations operate today, we're actually quite passionate about the industrial
base and the manufacturing base and the opportunity we have. One of the
questions that came up in an earlier dialogue as well is this notion of the industrial
metaverse. And look, before, you all roll your eyes...
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
I was waiting to ask you that question. I was just...
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Before all you roll your eyes on this metaverse thing because like if I told you all
aside and did individual interviews on the metaverse, like we all kind of have
diﬀerent opinion about it, people, 100 people into a room, you get 100 diﬀerent
answers about what the metaverse is and will anybody ever get any real value out of
it. To simplify, I look at it in kind of three buckets, and Kash and I were talking about
this earlier. There's the consumer metaverse. My avatar buys Kash's avatar of...
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
You buy me a beer, you'd rather have a real beer.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
I'd rather have the real beer than have my avatar buy your avatar a beer, but like
there'll be a monetization thing there in the consumer metaverse. There's theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

collaboration in the metaverse, and I do think that there's an opportunity there to
bring people from around the world with diﬀerent perspectives to collaborate. But
where I actually have the most amount of passion is in this thing I call the industrial
metaverse, and we have real tangible outcomes we're driving with customers today.
And so think of it as combining sets of technologies, IoT capabilities where you
come in and create a sensor fabric for any industrial process, any manufacturing
environment, any supply chain or logistics scenario. You have that sensor fabric, feed
large-scale cloud-based analytics solution, a large data store. And then you reason
over top of it with machine learning and create what we call digital twins of those
environments and simulate outcomes. If you think about it, if you make anything or
you move anything, you create a carbon footprint.
If I can simulate that for you inﬁnitely in the cloud before you make it and before you
move it, I can help you create a better product, more cost eﬀectively with lower
carbon footprint and lower water utilization, more sustainably than ever before. And
we see real progress happening today with companies like Coca-Cola, Unilever, AB
InBev, GM, Grupo Bimbo across industry of being able to model these processes,
save energy, reduce waste and these solutions pay for themselves. And so if you take
the cloud as a tool to solve for that, I think you would say that we are on the very,
very beginning of the curve of adoption and growth of what we can do long-term to
have the cloud really drive business outcomes and outcomes for society that really
matter.
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
I have a question on a topic that I'm petriﬁed. I don't know much about it. And I'm
not (Multiple Speakers) -- and many of my clients know that I do not really like
security, but it's a hot topic, it's hugely relevant and things have changed since I gave
up my interest in security 12, 13 years back. What are customer conversations in
security like these days? Why is it so important?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
I think you're right. There are a lot of customers that are -- every customer is
concerned about their security buster. Some are more concerned than others. I think
we're in a new world where cyber activities driven at the nation state level and
preparing customers to defend against that is hard work. The posture that we take
with our customers is the only way to navigate it is with a zero trust methodology.
And that has to be pervasive across everything you do from your identity backplane
to your endpoint management, to your cloud application security models and even
how you look at threat intelligence and your event and incident management
capabilities.
It's why we're so passionate about needing to have all of those assets be part of the
Microsoft Cloud because the mere active wiring together any part of what I just
described, creates a vulnerability because it's at the scene that you ﬁnd a lot of the
attack vectors that exist out there today. So security is inherent in every product we
build, but we also have added capabilities across endpoints, identity backplanes,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

demand it and need it in the world today.
So look, it is a huge body of work for us to make sure that we empower our
customers to be successful in the digital era because digital businesses are, of
course, more vulnerable to cyber crime than traditional ones. But if we think if you
take that zero trust posture, because it is as much of a culture and how you operate
as a company as it is technology, but you couple that together with a strong cyber
foundation, you can get to a place where your institution is secure.
{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
I'm less insecure about security after it. Anybody else with a last opportunity to pose
a question of Judson? If not, I have one ﬁnal one for you. We zoom back out a little
bit. What are we underappreciating with respect to a product or a market that
Microsoft is participating in that you don't get enough questions from us and really
take into it even your customers don't know that, oh, you've got this unbelievable
product or say what could we be talking about in the next few years that we're not
talking about today?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Sure. Yeah. I think it comes back to one of the questions you asked earlier, which is
how do we traverse the complex customer environment and how do we weave
together everything we have to create unique business value. And I made the
comment earlier, like I feel like we train this community to think about Microsoft 365
and how competitive that is, how competitive Azure may be or Dynamics and how
competitive our security oﬀerings might be. And of course, great for you all to
measure us against the share that we take in each one of those categories. But the
combined value of the whole of what we can bring through the Microsoft Cloud, I
think, is something that is really underestimated.
If you look at our very best customer relationships, they are those that have
leveraged the power of our portfolio, not just discreetly in all the categories we
compete, but to bring it together in a way in which new innovation is unlocked.
Maybe bridge two of these, for example, I talked about Teams as a platform and
citizen development and power platform. And I talked about the industrial
metaverse.
So Unilever is a company we've been working with for ﬁve years now, digitizing their
factories, and we digitized more than 100 of their factories around the world. And of
course, the industrial metaverse assets are allowing them to run more eﬃciently and
more eﬀectively and more sustainably than ever before. But the power in which the
way that industrial metaverse, digital twins connect back to Teams as a platform for
their frontline workers is helping them with everything from skills evolution and skills
development, employee satisfaction and worker retention through to how the
Boardroom can conceive more capability on the front lines to drive a more eﬀective
and more eﬃcient Unilever over time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

think about the collaboration environment, you'd have to think about the low-code
no-code environment. You'd have to think about the business applications portfolio.
You'd have to think about the cloud and the data. Look, the Microsoft oﬀerings all of
those things together. And we're at our best when we marry up our portfolio of
intellectual property with our customers' business needs, and that's what we're
going to go do.

{BIO 22837283 <GO>}
It's roughly. What I wanted to say was it's not too often that you see a $100 billion-ish
running business growing 25%, 30%. Here's the man that made it happen. So thank
you for getting us excited about technology, getting us excited about everything in
general. Thank you.
