Good morning. Welcome to day 2 of Adobe Summit. How's your experience so far?
Yes? Awesome. The Adobe marketing, content and the events team, they just do an
amazing job turning this event into an experience. Let's give them a round of
applause. Well done.
So a question. How many here is this your ﬁrst Summit? And maybe we can raise the
lights a little bit. I love this. Oh, goodness. Wow, we've got about half of this
audience is here for the ﬁrst time. Well welcome to Adobe Summit. We're very glad
you're here. We're very glad you're part of this community.
For those of you who have been to Summit before, you'll know that day 1 is typically
focused on product. We do our product vision. We talk about our announcements.
So that's really the focus of the day 1, which was yesterday. On day 2, we focus a little
bit more on the personal side of transformation and what each of us is going
through and how we ﬁnd inspiration for this change.
So true to form, yesterday was an amazing morning of product innovation. We talked
about how Adobe is deﬁning the industry's ﬁrst Experience System of Record with
the Adobe Cloud Platform and how our analytics, advertising and often imitated but
never duplicated Marketing Cloud continue to lead the industry in innovation. And
our announcement of the Adobe Experience, this was particularly exciting to me
because we all need to awaken that experience maker within.
Yesterday, we talked about being an experience maker and how now is the time to
change, to evolve, to grow from being an experience thinker to an experience
maker. So I want you to ask yourself: Are you an experience maker? Well if you're notFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-28

Jensen Hsun Huangsure, now is the time to take action. And Summit is the place to begin, especially this
morning.
We deﬁne experience makers as the agitators, as the rabble-rousers, right, the
people who dare to believe that things could and should be better. Then they roll up
their sleeves and they get to work. Well I'm giving you permission to agitate and to
go rouse rabble on behalf of your customers. And this is what we're going to focus
on today.
We have an incredible lineup of individuals who are going to help us think about
innovation across technology, sports, humanitarian eﬀorts, social media and
entrepreneurship. So my ask of you this morning is to think about what change you
want to drive in your organization and more importantly, in yourself to become an
experience maker.
So let's get started with 2 of the most inﬂuential thought leaders in this industry,
Jensen Huang, Founder, President and CEO of NVIDIA; and our own Chairman,
President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Jensen Huang and Shantanu Narayen.
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
Thank you. Really appreciate you being here, Jensen. It's thrilling to have my friend
here with me onstage today. And in particular, I appreciate you taking the time away
because this week actually turns out to be GTC in San Jose, which as Jensen was
telling me is probably the biggest concentration of what's happening with AI and
research and graphics in Santa Clara today. So really again, thank you for being here
today.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
I would do anything for you, Shantanu.
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
Appreciate it.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}

The one thing we are doing, Jensen, is we're actually broadcasting this live.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}

{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
Well with your technology...
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
I would do anything for you. I just -- ﬁrst of all, I was just going to say the work that
we do, we're amazing. Ladies and gentlemen, we're amazing. And the amazing thing
is we've been amazing for a long time.
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
The good news is my board is here today. So maybe I'm getting my performance
appraisal in real time here with my board being here. So it's a good thing, Jensen.
But what I was going to say was the fact that we have this great technology, done by
NVIDIA, is probably going to appear in Santa Clara that we're live there as well. So
with virtual reality, I think we're all okay. But Adobe has always been about images.
And the fact that Adobe has always been about images, I found one of you that I
really like. So what I wanted to do is show that image of Jensen.

Wise man and the biker.
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
In all seriousness, this conference is all about disruption and what everybody is
seeing with respect to what's happening with industries, the transformation that's
happening. And I thought it would be incredibly valuable for people to hear a little
bit about the NVIDIA story. You cofounded it 25 years ago. But I'd love to just take us
back and talk about the beginnings of NVIDIA.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yes, Shantanu. You and I have a lot of technology history together. We both love
computer graphics. And the reason why we've loved computer graphics is because
for the longest time, it's been one of the greatest challenges of computer science to
recreate reality. And so 25 years ago, if you recall, take you back, Windows 3.1 had
just come out and 3D graphics was not available on PCs.
And so we had a great idea. We said, "Hi. look, one day, everybody is going to be a
gamer." Just as I believe one day, everybody is going to be a creator. And we said,
"One day, everybody is going to be a gamer." And if we could ﬁgure out a way to
make the personal computer into a 3-dimensional graphics workstation, if you will.
But for consumers and we could create these virtual reality environments for people,
2 things are going to happen.
One, we're going to enable this incredibly large market, video games. At the time,
Electronic Arts had, I think, 14 employees and their CTO was -- I think had to be
driven to work because he didn't have a driver's license. And so the video game
industry was really tiny. And so one, we created an enormously large industry. But
the second thing is that computer graphics, because it's so computationally diﬃcult,
that we could become one of the companies in the world that could be the driving
force of the future of computing.
And those 2 things combined was the inspiration behind NVIDIA. And I would say
that, that idea, the idea that 3D graphics is the driving force of computing and that
video games, the creation of virtual reality, these virtual experiences that allows you
to be teleported into anything you want to go, that insight, I think, was really great
and has really driven our company.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-28

And I think you used the word insight appropriately. I mean, I was at Silicon Graphics
at that point and everybody thought that SGI was indestructible. And the brilliant
idea that you had was how can we make that in the hands of millions of people,
which has certainly paid out phenomenally. But what a lot of people may not know is
that while that was the genesis of the company, you've actually made dramatic
changes over the years. And again, as I said, people are talking about how one
changes culture and changes companies. So tell us a little bit about some of the
other big investments or bets that you've made along the way.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
There were 2 -- there were probably 2 large changes. Well for the people who have
been watching NVIDIA for a long time, our industry, our industry changes so
incredibly fast. And technology forces are tremendous and we're surrounded by --
NVIDIA is a larger company today. But for the last 25 years, we were always a tiny
company in the presence of giants. And so with technology changing so fast, it's
hard to even stay alive. And so we -- job 1 was just simply to recreate ourselves,
reinvent ourselves to stay alive.
But there were 2 things that happened. One, we decided that more than computer
graphics, we would expand the aperture of our computing to be able to simulate the
laws of physics. And the reason for that is because in order to create reality, you have
to simulate the laws of physics. That expansion of our aperture allowed us to go into
all kinds of ﬁelds in scientiﬁc computing, which led ultimately to artiﬁcial intelligence.
The second thing, the second big investment that we made was observing that this
new model of software that we all called deep learning and AI, it was going to
change the way that people develop software going forward, that we could write
software ﬁnally that no humans could write. Just as we could create companies in the
future that no humans could create, we thought that we could create software that
no humans could create. And so that observation was a great one. And seven years
ago, we took the company and we pivoted into AI and...
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
The rest, as they say, is history.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Oh, my gosh.
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
Yes. Well it's been incredibly successful. But this week, in particular, Jensen, you're
actually -- given we are so big together in terms of what we do with graphics and
images, you made a pretty profound announcement associated with what'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-28

Shantanu Narayen

Shantanu Narayen
Jensen Hsun Huanghappening with ray-tracing and again, how that's going to change the paradigm
once again. Maybe you can share a little bit more about that.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
The computer graphics model that you and I enjoyed, in your case, 40 years ago, in
my case, less -- you are the...
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
Well I do have my birth certiﬁcate.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
The wise old man of our industry. So the computer graphics model that we've
dreamt of creating is the idea of simulating light rays as it bounces through the
world. Could you imagine, we had to sit -- take one light ray, bounce it all over
everything. And wherever it's absorbed, reﬂected, in this case, refracted through this
curved surface. And what I see on the table are these interesting light patterns, it's
called caustics, if you remember.
And so this form of computer graphics was only possible in the ﬁlm industry because
they used supercomputers to create every single frame. And in fact, when we walked
onstage, the amazing, beautiful graphics you were showing, the subtle shadows, like
beautiful lighting, all of that was made possible by this technology called ray-tracing,
except it needed supercomputers, these large servers. And every 1 of those frames
out of every 30 frames, 1 out of those 30, it takes 10 hours to render each one of
those frames.
Well our dream in that whole time that we've been in computer graphics is to do this
in real time. And ﬁnally, last week, we announced the eﬀort of about 10 years of
endeavor, changing the way computer graphics is done, changing the architecture
of computer graphics, the algorithms of computer graphics. And we announced the
NVIDIA RTX. And we can now do what you just showed in real time. And it's just a
huge breakthrough.
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
And that's something that we really share in common, which is we believe that
everybody has a story to tell. And using technology in an intuitive, accessible way,
whether you're a student or whether you're a high-end professional, is such an
awesome responsibility and opportunity to do. But maybe again, I think a number of
people here, whether you're in retail, whether you're in clothing, you're in travel and
hospitality, I think they're all thinking about what does augmented reality and virtual
reality mean in terms of the kind of experience they can deliver their customers. So
what happens with AR and VR?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-28
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 13Shantanu Narayen
Jensen Hsun HuangOne way to think about AR and VR is this. And this is going to sound crazy. But it's
actually an easier idea, right? AR and VR -- in the case of VR, it's a wormhole for us to
travel to virtual worlds. VR is simply a path that allows us to telepresence, to
wormhole into another virtual world. AR is the way for artiﬁcial intelligence agents
that are in these virtual worlds to wormhole into us. And so these AR, these agents,
these virtual reality -- these artiﬁcial intelligence agents in these universes, the way
they come into our world is to travel through the AR wormhole. Then they'll be
sitting right there in front of us in augmented reality, mixed reality. And the way we
go into their world is to travel through VR, which is this wormhole to go into.
Now the other day -- yesterday, I showed something that the world has never seen
before. And it's really quite amazing. Let me just -- if I could just tell you about it. And
so inside the company, we called it Project Wakanda. Project Wakanda -- Wakanda is,
as you guys know, the most advanced society in the world, it's in Africa, Black
Panther. You guys know about this. And so they -- and so it's Project Wakanda. What
we did was this. We created this Holodeck. And inside this Holodeck, you can go into
it and it creates a virtual car. And when I'm inside this Holodeck, I can control, I can
wormhole, teleport into an autonomous vehicle anywhere on the planet. And now
my mind and this autonomous vehicle becomes one. And I can drive this car from
anywhere, wherever it is, from my Holodeck.
And so the way to think about that is, all of a sudden, VR is our way of
communicating with the future of AI. And this communication system -- today, we call
it virtual reality. We think about head-mounted displays, we think about augmented
reality as these computer graphics, things that are sitting on our table. But in the
future, it's going to be much, much more than that. You're going to create
experiences with the tools that you guys have that allows people to create these
enormous number of virtual realities. And if we want to go into these new worlds,
we'll wormhole into it using VR. If we want to invite one of our agents, these AIs that
we've created, these little, tiny pet that helps us do something, keeps us happy,
keeps us company, it comes into our world. And so I think this is going to be an
exciting future.
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
I think it already is. Just a little bit from technology to how you impacted change. You
said that seven years ago, you really made this big bet on AI. How did you get the
organization through that, that you were going to make this left shift and AI was
going to be the future in terms of transforming the company, the people?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Well I think -- well, ﬁrst of all, I think that Adobe is a great example of transformation.
I've known Adobe my entire career. And the Adobe of today and the Adobe that I
knew a long time ago has gone through several transformations yourselves. So you
know the story really well.
The fact of the matter is there is no alternative to rolling up your sleeves and trying to
understand yourself, the implications of the new dynamics of the industry. To try toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-28

Scott K. Belskyunderstand yourself, you don't have to -- we don't have to understand it deeply. But
we have to understand it intuitively, the implications of the technology, the
implications of the dynamics that are going on in the industry.
We have to roll up our sleeves. Just as you rolled up your sleeves, you've got to roll
up your sleeves to understand these dynamics. Then you've got to invite people to
work with us and be our teammates to learn how to apply this new technology or
repivot the company into this new dynamic. You've just got to do it step by step by
step. And I think there's no alternative to leaders being in the kitchen, playing...
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
And that's really, in many ways, Jensen, I think the call to action that we made for
people here. We're calling them experience makers, which is when you have an idea,
how do you take that idea and make that really real? And so I think that's been one
of the underlying themes of the conference, people who want to make this change.
But you talked about technology. And I thought actually we have a slight surprise for
you. What a lot of people -- and if Scott can come up, it's just -- we put this together,
this demo because NVIDIA has delivered this absolutely incredible technology with
respect to GPUs and what they could be done. And we talked yesterday about open
ecosystems and how -- the power of getting these open ecosystems. So we put our
engineers to work a little bit and said, "Let's show Jensen some stuﬀ of what we can
do with his AI and our AI together. Scott?
{BIO 2409231 <GO>}
Great. Thank you, Shantanu. And as you mentioned, NVIDIA has a rich history of
innovation in the gaming market. And I'm using a gaming laptop powered by
NVIDIA's GTX 1080. And we want to run an experiment and see what Adobe Sensei
could bring to the gaming experience with these powerful GPUs.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Hi. if this turns out really, really good, it's my idea. But if it turns out not so good...
{BIO 2409231 <GO>}
So here I am in the AAA game, Witcher 3, in the town of Novigrad. And NVIDIA has
built a great tool called Ansel. And with Ansel, not only can you take screenshots of
your gameplay in 4K. But it allows you to immerse yourself in the game with a 360
view.
So let's just navigate the scene in 360 using the Ansel app. Here, I'm just going to
zoom in and take a screenshot of this character using Ansel. I think this looks pretty
good. Then I took the liberty of adding a Sensei panel to this demo app.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-28

Shantanu NarayenLet's just see what Sensei has to say about the image. So as you can see, Sensei is
tagging interesting things in this image. It's identiﬁed a man, a warrior. But more
than that, it's also making judgments about the images.
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
So what we are doing in real time, in other words, Scott, is we're actually interfacing
with the NVIDIA stuﬀ. And we're using our own machine learning as well as our
image recognition technology as people are navigating in real time. So think about
the opportunities, Jensen, as it relates to people doing retail or the ability to not just
do all this in real time. But even understand exactly what's happening in a deep
semantic sense.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 2409231 <GO>}
That's right. That's right. And here, we've shown that Sensei also created an Auto
Mask of this character, which I can easily open up in Photoshop to create diﬀerent
scenes to place this character. Now I'm just going to activate Sensei.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
That is so cool that with just one click and it just masks.
{BIO 2409231 <GO>}
That's right.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Stencils out that character just like that. It's just incredible.
{BIO 2409231 <GO>}
And so as we navigate the scene, Sensei is ﬁnding interesting objects here. I paused
on this particular scene with the villagers. And Sensei has detected a man, a woman
and this cauldron of ﬁre. And as we navigate through, Sensei is taking shots, making
judgments about the quality of those shots and trying to pick the most interesting
things. So let's navigate some more. We found a barrel, a dog and a horse.
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
So in real time, as he's navigating, we're seeing this is a dog, this is a human, this is a
horse. So that's actually incredible, the kinds of possibilities that they can do. And
this was done just by virtue of the fact that you have this open architecture thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-28

Scott K. Belskyallows us. And we are doing the same for our customers here in the audience, which
is we're making Sensei available so that experience makers can actually apply their
own data science, Jensen, much like we've done before.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
So you're actually showing something that's really the power of modern artiﬁcial
intelligence. And so of course, you guys have trained the network on horses, dogs
and et cetera, et cetera. And yet this particular image of a horse is a computer-
generated cartoon horse. But your model was suﬃciently robust and understands
the diversity of data well enough that they still recognize that as a horse. Now
traditional computer vision algorithms wouldn't have recognized that as a horse. But
you and I recognized it as a horse. And therefore, we taught the AI how to do that.
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
That's right.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
And so Sensei has now...
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
That's exactly right. And I think it actually -- can't we even do more with respect to
emotions and...
{BIO 2409231 <GO>}
Yes. In fact, we tag about 40,000 diﬀerent concepts. And here, we've focused on
objects as opposed to moods and sort of more abstract concepts. And here, you can
see we've closed in on this sort of work area. And we've identiﬁed the various tools
and the clothes and the stool. Let me just navigate to one other place in the scene.
And again, Sensei is taking shots along the way of the things that it thinks are
interesting. So here, we have a few guys talking. And this other guy, who doesn't
look so happy in the back, who looks like maybe he's a merchant, maybe people
aren't buying what he has to sell. But let's close up on him.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yes. That's really good. That's a great model. You guys did a good job.
{BIO 2409231 <GO>}
And Sensei can also actually understand aspects of this character. So we can
understand his approximate age, the fact that he's masculine. You weren't so sure
about whether or not he was wearing a hat. But we know that he's not...FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-28

Jensen Hsun Huang{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
But doing this in real time then, Scott, I think there's one last thing. So we've been
navigating real time in this entire virtual world. You're collecting all the information.
As you can see, we now have more information about things like age. What if you go
past this? Then how do you recapture all of that intelligence?
{BIO 2409231 <GO>}
Yes. That's the great part. So for example, here, we've even captured that his arms
are crossed. And the fact that he's not smiling and has arms crossed means he's
probably angry. Now as we captured all these things, we can actually search for the
best frames that represent these concepts. And so we have the tags here at the
bottom. So I can easily do something like click on dog and see the shots that we
took that had the dog. Or we can try the person and do the shots of the person. But
let me show you one more thing. We can even construct more complex queries. So
I'm going to go up to the search bar. Show me the angry man with arms crossed.
And there he is.
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
That's (inaudible)
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
That's cool.
{BIO 2409231 <GO>}
Thank you.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Now obviously, you could do this for video games. But you can do this for real
videos and everything.
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
That's correct, as well as retail experiences, travel experiences. Maybe just a couple --
switching gears for a little bit, Jensen. You're a company that's inventing the future.
But how do you think about marketing? How do you think about marketing? Who's
the audience? And a lot of the companies here are B2C. But there are also a number
of companies that are B2B as well as specialized marketing for audiences. Maybe a
little bit about how you think about that.

Jensen Hsun HuangWell you guys, you know that we're the world's largest gaming platform. NVIDIA
GeForce is all over the world. There's 100 million people who are on NVIDIA
GeForce Experience, which is our platform. And so we're communicating, we're in
contact with all of our customers all the time. The way we think about marketing is
storytelling. They don't want us to market to them. They don't want us to advertise to
them. But we tell stories. We share stories with them, whether it's stories that we
create -- and that's why the creative department in our company is so close to our
marketing department. And I'm so close to the creative department. The stories that
we tell them, the stories that they tell each other, we share. We allow them to tell
their story through our platform.
And so storytelling is probably the central part of everything we do in marketing.
And it's content creation. We use -- we obviously use everything that you guys
create. And we use it to tell a story. Then secondarily, if not for the Adobe Experience
Manager, our ability to connect all of our customers to the stories that we tell would
have been impossible and -- because we have diﬀerent stories that we want to tell
diﬀerent people because they play diﬀerent games and they're interested in
diﬀerent types of stories in diﬀerent countries. And so we use the Adobe Experience
Manager so that we can connect the right stories with the right customers. And so
that's kind of how we think about it.
{BIO 3332391 <GO>}
So we have Jensen. He's -- as he described it a little bit before, he reinvents quantum
physics when he has his morning cup of tea. You're doing ray-tracing and ﬁguring
out the world. But you also talked about the fact that you roll up your sleeves, as I
understand it. And help people through change. There's a rumor that when -- you
made some sort of a bet and commitment associated with a tattoo, Jensen. Is there
any truth to that rumor associated with rolling up your sleeves?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Well I roll up my sleeves. And I do have a tattoo. And I'm -- here's what happened. So
4 splits -- 2 splits ago, the management team was having dinner 1 night. And
somebody says, "Our stock is going to hit $100." And usually, I don't care about
things like that and -- but the other person -- somebody else said, "Yes. It's deﬁnitely
going to hit $100." And somebody else said, "You know what, if it hits $100, what are
you guys all going to do?" And somebody said, "I'll shave my head." And somebody
says, "I'll pierce my nipples." Then somebody said, "I'll do a tattoo." And somebody
said, "I'll do an earring. And Jensen, what are you going to do?" And I said, "I don't
care, whatever you guys want. It's not going to hit $100."
And so they said, "Okay, well, you're going to get a tattoo." And I said, "Yes, sure,
