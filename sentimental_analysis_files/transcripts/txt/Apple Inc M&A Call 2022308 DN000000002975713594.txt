Good morning and welcome back to Apple Park. Thank you for joining us for our
ﬁrst event of 2022. Today, we have some great announcements to share. We've been
working hard to deliver new products and services that help you stay connected,
productive and entertained. So let's start with Apple TV+.
Like many of you, I've been watching a lot of shows and movies with the time I've
been spending at home. Along with our great original series, like Ted Lasso, The
Morning Show, For All Mankind, Servant, and the Afterparty, we're working with
some of the most imaginative ﬁlmmakers in the world and making great original
movies as well like the emotional powerhouse Swan Song featuring a riveting
performance by Mahershala Ali, who earned a lead actor nomination from the
prestigious BAFTAS. Joel Coen's The Tragedy of Macbeth starring Denzel
Washington and Frances McDormand, this beautiful ﬁlm was nominated for three
Academy Awards including best actor. Remarkably this is Denzel's 10th Academy
Award nomination. And CODA, which was also nominated for three Academy
Awards including best picture. CODA is a powerful and inspiring story, which broke
barriers with its predominantly deaf cast including Troy Kotsur, who became the ﬁrst
deaf male actor to be nominated for an Oscar.
Now let's take a quick look at these Apple original ﬁlms and some more incredible
ones coming soon. (Video Presentation) We hope you will love these amazing
movies as much as we do. They bring drama, suspense and joy to our lives. And with
Apple TV+, we're always looking for new ways to bring more of this to you. And with
that in mind, we've got something exciting to share. (Video Presentation) Introducing
Friday night baseball on Apple TV+. Tune in on Friday nights for two games you can
only see on Apple TV+. We're really excited about this. This is going to be the best

Alpine green joins the most Pro lineup we've ever created. You can pre-order these
new models starting this Friday and they will be available on March 18. Now let's talk
about Apple silicon. The development of Apple silicon was inspired by iPhone and
has delivered cutting edge performance and capabilities for many years. It continues
to have a phenomenal impact on our products and the industry.
In addition to industry leading performance per Watt, Apple silicon delivers many
other advancements. The custom build image signal processor drives our dynamic
camera experiences. The Neural Engine unlocks breakthrough machine learning
capabilities. The Secure on Play protects the biometric information used in Face ID
and touch ID. These are just a few of the innovations enabled by Apple silicon that
makes our products such a huge hit with customers. And today, we're bringing our
extraordinary A15 Bionic chip to another iPhone. (Video Presentation) The new
iPhone SE.
From the very beginning, we designed iPhone SE to include some of our most
advanced features and technologies while delivering the iPhone experience at an
incredible price. This is important for our existing users who want a smaller iPhone
and a great value. It's also been an incredibly popular model with new iPhone users
and we're continuing to add new users to iPhone at a faster pace. In fact, this past
fall, we've added more new users to the iPhone 13 lineup than in each of the
previous ﬁve launches and we're excited for the iPhone SE to build on this
momentum.
Now here's Francesca to tell you more.
{BIO 19151290 <GO>}
(Video Presentation) At the heart of iPhone SE is A15 Bionic, the same chip as an
iPhone 13. Bringing this level of performance to our most aﬀordable phone is
something only Apple can do. A15 Bionic makes nearly every experience better from
simple things like launching apps, growing through photos, to intense workloads like
processing, depth information on the ﬂy. A15 Bionics packs a powerful 6 core CPU to
handle demand and cast smoothly and eﬃciently. It's up to 1.8 times faster than
iPhone 8 and even faster compared to older models. This CPU is faster than all the
competition at any price. The 4-core GPU is great for graphics intensive use cases
and delivers a monumental improvement for people upgrading. That means when

wheel of your dream car.
Apps can take advantage of the 16-core Neural Engine perfect from machine
learning task and capable of 15.8 trillion operations per second, which is 26 times
faster than iPhone 8. And if you're upgrading from a phone without a Neural Engine,
it unlocks new ways to use your iPhone that make your life easier like live text, point
your camera at text and with the tap you can copy it, translate it, make a call or send
an email. iPhone SE isn't just powerful. It's beautiful too. It features iconic glass and
aluminum design in three fantastic colors, midnight, starlight, and product red. It has
a 4.7-inch Retina HD display with incredible color accuracy. The display is even more
protected by the durable design, which now includes the toughest glass in a
smartphone on both the front and back.
This is the same glass as the back of iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro. And with IP67
water and dust resistance, iPhone SE is designed to last. iPhone SE has the home
button with touch ID for a secure, private and easy way to unlock your iPhone, ﬁll in
passcodes, and make purchases with Apple Pay. iPhone SE has even better battery
life. With the eﬃciency of A15 Bionic, integration with iOS, our latest battery
chemistry and internal design update. And we're bringing 5G to our most aﬀordable
iPhone. So iPhone SE can take advantage of the latest generation of technology. You
get super-fast downloads and uploads, lower latency and better experiences in more
place like seeing family with higher quality HD FaceTime calls even when you aren't
on WiFi or enjoying your favorite movies with friends using Share Play or playing
multiplayer online games.
IPhone SE also has some of our latest camera innovations. The 12-megapixel camera
and A15 Bionic create a new camera system that enables powerful computational
photography. Deep Fusion optimizes for texture and detail in every part of the
photo. Smart HDR 4 applies individual adjustments for color, contrast, and noise to
subjects and the backgrounds. Photographic styles brings your preferred style
automatically to the image pipeline during capture while preserving skin tones. The
ISP in A15 bionic improves video quality for truer skin tones and reduced noise,
especially in lower light. iPhone SE comes with all the incredible beneﬁts of iOS 15,
including new features like focus to help reduce distraction to be in the moment and
an all-new Maps experience. And you'll get intelligent capabilities that protect your
privacy like on device Siri and on device dictation that just weren't possible with
older phones.
IPhone SE will get the latest iOS updates for years to come. iPhone SE continues our
commitment to minimize the impact on the environment. Like we did with iPhone 13,
we eliminated the outer plastic wrap from our packaging and we used recycled
materials in the design of iPhone SE, like in the Taptic Engine where we use 100%
recycled rare earth elements and 100% recycled tungsten. iPhone SE is a fantastic
new iPhone that brings the performance of A15 Bionic, the speed of 5G, better
durability, better battery life, and advanced new camera capabilities. And it starts at
just $429. Pre-orders start this Friday and iPhone SE will be available on March 18.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
The new iPhone SE brings the advanced features and exceptional performance of
A15 to our most aﬀordable iPhone. It's going to be great for existing iPhone users
who want a highly capable and compact iPhone and for new users who want to
experience iPhone for the ﬁrst time. Apple silicon is a huge part of the success of
another remarkable product and that's iPad. The unmatched performance and
eﬃciency of Apple silicon enables iPad's magical experience from its versatility and
portability, to its exceptionally long battery life. It makes iPad the most powerful
device of its kind and even faster than the vast majority of PC notebooks.
We have a fantastic iPad lineup. And today I'm excited to talk about iPad Air. We love
iPad Air for being incredibly thin, light and powerful. And now we're taking its
performance to the next level. (Video Presentation) This is the new, even more
amazing iPad Air. And to tell you all about it, here's Angelina.
The incredibly popular design of iPad Air is super-charged with the power of Apple
silicon, so let's jump right in and talk about performance. Whether you're a college
student taking elaborate notes, a content creator working on your latest project, or a
gamer playing the hottest titles, great performance is a key reason users choose iPad
Air. So the new Air takes a massive leap in performance, because we're bringing the
breakthrough M1 Chip to iPad Air. That's right. This is the same M1 chip that we
brought to iPad Pro. The 8-core design of the CPU delivers up to 60% faster
performance over the A14 in the previous generation of iPad Air. And M1's 8-core
GPU delivers amazing graphics performance, which is up to twice as fast. In fact, M1
in the new iPad Air makes it faster than the fastest competitive tablet. And the new
Air is also up to two times faster than the best selling Windows laptop in its price
range, a device that is three times thicker and four times heavier than iPad Air.
So for users doing things like drawing a ﬁlter for a social media post with Procreate,
or designing the ultimate kid's bedroom in SketchUP, the new Air will ﬂy right
through it. And with M1, the new Air becomes a mobile gaming powerhouse. And
machine learning workﬂows are enhanced by the incredible 16-core Neural Engine,
enabling powerful and intuitive experiences. Like using Adobe Lightroom to
intelligently select the sky from the foreground with just a tap so you can edit
seamlessly. And these experiences really come to life on the Air's gorgeous Liquid
Retina display with its P3 wide color, True Tone, 500 nits of brightness, and anti-
reﬂective coating.
Another big update for iPad Air is the front camera, because it will now feature a 12-
megapixel Ultra Wide camera, which means it supports Center Stage. This has been
hugely popular for connecting with friends, colleagues, and loved ones. And this
means that now all iPad models feature Center Stage. Next, with its ultra portable
design, we know users need fast wireless connectivity when they're on the go. That's
why we're bringing ultra-fast 5G to iPad Air, perfect for when you're doing things likeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 5 of 13Timothy D. Cookusing SharePlay to watch movies with your friends wherever you are. And to support
fast connection to drives, docks, and cameras, we're increasing the performance of
the USB-C port. It is now twice as fast, so transferring large photos or videos is even
quicker. And iPad Air is compatible with amazing accessories that make it even more
versatile, like the Smart Keyboard Folio and Magic Keyboard, which delivers a
fantastic trackpad and typing experience.
IPad Air also supports Apple Pencil second generation, which users absolutely love
for drawing and taking notes. And of course, driving the entire iPad experience is
iPadOS. iPadOS 15 is packed with powerful new features like enhanced multi-tasking,
Quick Note, and SharePlay, which make iPad even more capable. And with the new
version of Swift Playgrounds, users can build and submit apps to the App Store right
on iPad. A new release of iMovie is perfect for aspiring ﬁlmmakers working on their
latest masterpiece or for users who are just getting started. The new storyboards
feature helps users create ﬁnished videos by using curated shot lists, transitions, and
music for a polished result. It's a great new release that will be available next month.
And we continue our commitment to the environment. The new Air has a number of
components with 100% recycled materials, like the aluminum in the enclosure, tin in
the solder of the main logic board, and rare earth elements in the enclosure and
audio magnets. We're really excited about the new iPad Air. Let's take a look. (Video
Presentation)
So this is the new iPad Air. And it comes in a gorgeous array of colors, Space Gray,
Starlight, Pink, Purple, and a stunning new Blue. It will be available starting at the
same great price of $599. This is an incredible price for such a powerful device. It
comes in both 64 gigabyte and 256 gigabyte conﬁgurations and it will be available
in both Wi-Fi and cellular models. You can begin ordering Friday and it will be
available March 18. With the supercharged performance of M1, ultrafast 5G, and
Center Stage, we think you're going to love the new iPad Air. Back to Tim.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
With the addition of M1, iPad Air is now more powerful, more capable, and simply
more fun than ever. Next, let's talk about the Mac. Apple silicon has transformed the
Mac over this past year. Its incredible performance, custom technologies, and
cutting-edge power eﬃciency have ushered in a new era for the Mac. We've
transitioned nearly every product in the Mac lineup to Apple silicon. And each of
these products has blown away users and shocked the PC industry. When we
introduced the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air with M1, our customers no longer had
to choose between incredible performance and amazing battery life. They could
have it all. And Apple silicon has enabled us to design products we never could have
imagined before, like the remarkably thin and powerful new iMac made possible by
M1.
And the newest MacBook Pro with M1 Pro and M1 Max has completely redeﬁned
what pros expect from a notebook. It simply has no equal. Customers are absolutely
loving these systems. In fact, every quarter since we started shipping M1-based Macs
has been record-breaking and we've outpaced the industry growth during this time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

here's John.
{BIO 22135753 <GO>}
Apple silicon has had a profound impact on the Mac. Every chip in the M1 family has
been groundbreaking, allowing us to make the world's best personal computers for
our users. And now we're going to take the next giant leap. Because today we're
bringing Apple silicon to users who need even more extreme levels of performance
to unleash their creativity. We're adding one last chip to the M1 family, and it's going
to blow your mind. Here it is. (Video Presentation) Introducing M1 Ultra. It is a
monster of a chip. And it brings breathtaking levels of performance to the Mac
desktop. So let me hand it over to Johny to tell you more about its incredible
architecture.
{BIO 19052877 <GO>}
M1 Ultra is the next breakthrough for Apple silicon. So far, we've scaled Apple silicon
for the Mac from M1 to M1 Pro to M1 Max. And with each chip, we've extended the
architecture to deliver phenomenal performance, while maintaining remarkable
power eﬃciency, and scaling the uniﬁed memory architecture. This approach has
also provided a consistent developer programming model across the M1 family. And
now we want to take Apple silicon even further to achieve more extreme levels of
performance for the desktop.
The challenge is that there are physical limitations in creating a larger die than M1
Max. The leading approach is to use two chips and connect them via the
motherboard. However, that approach has signiﬁcant tradeoﬀs, including increased
latency, reduced bandwidth and much higher power consumption. This also burdens
developers with the need to change their code for this architecture. So with M1 Ultra,
we did something truly groundbreaking. And it actually starts with M1 Max, the most
powerful SoC we've built to date. With its high-performance CPU, massive GPU, and
tremendous uniﬁed memory bandwidth, M1 Max is incredibly capable, and its
amazing performance is delivered while maintaining industry-leading power
eﬃciency. Yet it's even more capable than what we've shared.
You see, M1 Max has a secret. A hidden feature we haven't talked about until now. It
has a groundbreaking die to die interconnect technology that allows us to scale
even further by building M1 Ultra from two M1 Max die, which doubles performance.
And we connect the two die with our innovative, custom-built packaging
architecture. This multi-die architecture is way ahead of anything else in the industry,
and we call it UltraFusion. The UltraFusion architecture uses a silicon interposer that
has twice the connection density of any technology available.
It connects over 10,000 signals and provides an enormous 2.5 terabyte per second
of low latency, inter-processor bandwidth between the two die using very little
power. That's more than four times the bandwidth of the leading multi-chip
interconnect technology. The result is an SoC with blazing performance due to low
latency, massive bandwidth, and incredible power eﬃciency. And thanks to theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 7 of 13John Ternusmagic of the UltraFusion architecture, it behaves like a single chip to software and
preserves the beneﬁts of the uniﬁed memory. M1 Ultra has 114 billion transistors.
That's seven times more than M1. It's the most ever in a personal computer chip. And
when you add it to the M1 family, you can see the huge diﬀerence in area between
M1 and M1 Ultra.
This multi-die architecture also supports a higher bandwidth memory subsystem. In
fact, with two die, the memory bandwidth is increased to a massive 800 gigabyte
per second. That's more than 10 times the latest PC desktop chip. And doubling the
memory channels also means M1 Ultra supports up to a staggering 128 gigabytes of
uniﬁed memory for enormous workloads. M1 Ultra also oﬀers an unbelievable
amount of compute performance. It has a powerful 20-core CPU with 16 high-
performance cores and four high-eﬃciency cores to crush CPU intensive tasks. It also
features a huge 64-core GPU, so it can speed through the most intense graphic
tasks. It's nearly 8 times faster than M1.
M1 Ultra has 32 powerful Neural Engine cores that can run up to 22 trillion
operations per second to accelerate the most formidable machine learning tasks.
And it has twice the capabilities of the amazing Media Engine in M1 Max for
unprecedented ProRes video encode and decode throughput. Power eﬃciency
aﬀects the entire system, including enclosure design, thermals, acoustics, and,
ultimately, performance. So the industry leading performance per watt of M1 Max
and M1 Ultra is a huge advantage for a desktop. M1 Max delivers similar
multithreaded CPU performance to the latest 10-core PC desktop chip while using
65% less power. And when we compare M1 Ultra to the fastest 16-core PC desktop
chip available, it delivers 90% higher performance in the same power envelope. And
M1 Ultra can deliver the PC chip's peak performance while using an astounding 100
watts less power. When we look at GPU performance and power, M1 Max delivers
similar performance to one of the most popular GPUs while using one-third the
power. And M1 Ultra delivers faster performance than the highest-end GPU available
while using 200 watts less power.
M1 Ultra provides industry-leading desktop class performance and power eﬃciency,
allowing us to deliver incredible performance in a much smaller, more eﬃcient
design. So that's the groundbreaking M1 Ultra. It's the most powerful and capable
chip ever for a personal computer. Now, back to John.
{BIO 22135753 <GO>}
M1 Ultra takes Apple silicon further than ever. It's another game-changing chip for
our pro users. Now, one of the things that makes Apple silicon so unique is how
tightly it integrates with the operating system. This integration enables macOS to
scale with M1 Ultra, allowing it to automatically beneﬁt from M1 Ultra's immense
capabilities, delivering another big step forward in performance. It also enables us to
deliver an amazing experience for our users. Everything is super fast and incredibly
responsive, and the system and user data are protected with industry-leading
security. The transition to Apple silicon has delivered the largest collection of apps
ever for Mac, including iPhone and iPad apps, which can now run on Mac, and
universal apps that unlock the full power of the M1 family.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 8 of 13Colleen NovielliAnd new apps with unbelievable performance continue to be released every week.
We're thrilled with how well this transition is going. And because M1 Ultra looks like a
single piece of silicon to software, apps will beneﬁt from its extraordinary capabilities
without any additional work. Let's hear what some of our developers have to say
about it. (Video Presentation) The combination of M1 Ultra and macOS cranks up the
performance of Mac yet again. So now let's talk about where we're going to use this
incredible new chip. Today, we're going to focus on the place where so many people
create their life's best work, the studio. A studio is where creators like designers,
scientists, and developers change the world. Whether it's in a home or an oﬃce,
each studio is unique, customized with the tools that complete the user's workﬂow,
and for many, the Mac plays a pivotal role in this space. With the transition to M1,
we've provided these users with two great desktops, iMac and Mac mini, which have
remarkable performance and entirely new capabilities. Yet there are some users who
want even more so they can push the limits of their creativity.
First, they want breakthrough performance and capability to turn their studio into a
creative powerhouse. Next, they want a wide range of connectivity for peripherals
that are key to their studio workﬂow. And ﬁnally, many want a modular system and
display so they can create their perfect setup. So that's what we're introducing today,
something totally new that gives our users exactly what they need to build the studio
of their dreams. And here it is. (Video Presentation)
This is Mac Studio and Studio Display. Mac Studio is an entirely new Mac with the
unbelievable performance of our most powerful Apple silicon, M1 Max and M1 Ultra.
And the Studio Display is the perfect complement to Mac Studio, with a phenomenal
set of features and that integrated experience Mac users love. So let's dive in,
starting with Mac Studio. And to tell you all about it, here's Colleen.
Mac Studio is a breakthrough in personal computing. It's unlike anything you've ever
seen before. It's the ﬁrst computer to put outrageous performance, extensive
connectivity, and entirely new capabilities into an unbelievably compact form that
lives right on your desk, where it's always within easy reach. Mac Studio is going to
completely transform studio workﬂows everywhere. Let's start with its design.
With the power and eﬃciency of Apple silicon, we were able to totally reimagine
what a high-performance desktop could look like. The exterior is machined from a
single aluminum extrusion, with a footprint of just 7.7 inches square and height of
only 3.7 inches, so it takes up very little space and ﬁts perfectly under most displays.
Inside, every element was designed to produce an unprecedented amount of
performance in such a small form factor. The innovative thermal system begins with a
unique double-sided blower pulling air into the system, across the entire
circumference of the perforated aluminum base.
The air moves over the custom circular power supply and through channels precisely
placed to guide it to the chip's thermal module. Finally, the air is propelled through a
low-impedance rear exhaust containing over 2,000 precisely-machined perforations.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 9 of 13And due to the eﬃciency of M1 Max and M1 Ultra, the sound is so minimal. For most
workloads, you'll barely even hear it. With this remarkably compact and quiet system
within arm's reach, you get easy access to essential connectivity throughout the day.
So next, let's take a look at the high-performance I/O Mac Studio provides.
On the back, there are four Thunderbolt 4 ports to connect displays and high-
performance devices, a 10 Gigabit Ethernet port, two USB-A ports, an HDMI port,
and a pro audio jack for high-impedance headphones or external ampliﬁed
speakers. WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5 are built in as well. And since many users
frequently connect and disconnect devices, like portable storage, we also put
connectivity on the front, for even easier access. Systems with M1 Max have two USB-
C ports, providing 10 gigabits per second USB-3 data transfer. And with M1 Ultra,
these ports are Thunderbolt 4, with up to 40 gigabits per second data transfer
speeds. There's also an SD card slot to easily import photos or video. And Mac
Studio oﬀers extensive display support, for up to four Pro Display XDRs, plus a 4K TV,
driving nearly 90 million pixels. With this wide array of advanced connectivity, you
can conﬁgure your studio to your exact needs.
Now let's take a look at the unprecedented performance Mac Studio will deliver.
When you compare Mac Studio to our most powerful Mac desktops, the 27-inch
iMac and Mac Pro, it takes performance to astonishing new heights. Let's start with
Mac Studio with M1 Max. For CPU performance, Mac Studio with M1 Max is up to 2.5
times faster than the fastest 27-inch iMac, and its upto 50% faster than Mac Pro with a
16-core Xeon processor, our most popular conﬁguration. Graphics performance on
Mac Studio with M1 Max is also tremendous. It's up to 3.4x faster than the fastest
graphics on the 27-inch iMac. And it even outperforms Mac Pro with its most popular
graphics card. Mac Studio is over three times faster.
Mac Studio with M1 Max is the high-performance machine many of our users have
been waiting for to take their workﬂows to the next level. And Mac Studio with M1
Ultra takes performance to a whole other dimension. The CPU performance on Mac
Studio with M1 Ultra is up to 3.8 times faster than the fastest 27-inch iMac. And it's up
to 90% faster than Mac Pro with 16-cores. We can even compare Mac Studio with M1
Ultra to Mac Pro with 28-cores. It's up to 60% faster. That is incredible. And graphics
performance on Mac Studio with M1 Ultra just crushes 27-inch iMac. It's up to a
remarkable 4.5 times faster. It even exceeds Mac Pro with its fastest graphics card.
Mac Studio is up to 80% faster.
Now, in the same way that MacBook Pro shattered the limits of graphics memory in a
laptop, Mac Studio will do the same for the desktop. The most powerful workstation
graphics card available today oﬀers 48 gigabytes of video memory. With M1 Max,
you can access up to 64 gigabytes of uniﬁed memory. And with M1 Ultra, you get up
to 128 gigabytes of uniﬁed memory for enormous graphics tasks. No other graphics
card comes close. And when it comes to storage, the SSD in Mac Studio delivers up
to a super fast 7.4 gigabytes per second of performance and up to 8 terabytes
capacity.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

Page 10 of 13Nicole KordesToday, more and more cameras are capturing ProRes video, from the iPhone 13 Pro
to the Sony Venice cinema camera. With M1 Ultra's extraordinarily powerful Media
Engine, Mac Studio can play an unprecedented 18 streams of 8K ProRes 422 video.
There is no other computer in the world that can do this. To sum up this game-
changing performance, Mac Studio with M1 Max is up to 3.4 times faster than our
fastest iMac. It's a huge upgrade for 27-inch iMac users looking to move to more
powerful Apple silicon. And for those looking for the most extreme performance,
Mac Studio with M1 Ultra is up to 80% faster than our top of the line Mac Pro.
So now let's take a look at how this unprecedented performance is going to
transform the studio. With the breakthrough capabilities of Mac Studio, users can
completely reimagine their workﬂows and push their creativity further than ever. For
musicians, Mac Studio powers the digital audio workstation they've been dreaming
of. They can bring their most complex compositions to life with hundreds of tracks,
plug-ins, and virtual instruments all played in real-time. 3D studios have new,
breakthrough capabilities with Mac Studio. Artists can now interact ﬂuidly with more
extreme geometry and run complex particle simulations in a fraction of the time.
They can even work with massive environments that were previously impossible to
render.
For software development studios, Mac Studio is an absolute monster. Engineers can
now build new versions of their code in warp speed and run more automated
integration and testing than ever. Mac Studio brings staggering performance to the
photo studio. Photographers can capture and edit huge gigapixel images
composited with hundreds of layers, and export ﬁnal images for publish in a ﬂash.
And Mac Studio is a powerhouse system for video studios. Colorists can add more
corrections to their project while maintaining ﬂuid playback. Editors working on
multi-cam projects can play more streams of 8K video than ever before. And
encoding video for ﬁnal delivery is faster than ever. The performance and capability
that Mac Studio brings to so many studios is going to change everything. There's
never been a desktop like it.
And when it comes to the environment, Mac Studio raises the bar yet again. It uses
far less energy than competitors to deliver its extraordinary performance. Over the
course of a year, Mac Studio will use up to 1,000 kilowatt-hours less energy than a
high-end PC desktop. Mac Studio is also free of numerous harmful substances. It
uses 100% recycled rare earth elements in the magnets and recycled tin in the solder
of the main logic board. So that's Mac Studio, featuring M1 Max and the new M1
Ultra, the most powerful chip ever built for a personal computer. Mac Studio will
supercharge the workspace with breathtaking performance, unleashing your
creativity like never before. Now, we designed Mac Studio together with the Studio
Display, to complete the ultimate studio experience. And to tell you more, here's
Nicole.
The Studio Display is in a class of its own. Along with a gorgeous screen, it's loaded

up to 30 degrees. To customize Studio Display for your workspace, you can also
choose a tilt- and height-adjustable stand option, which has a counterbalancing arm
that makes the display feel weightless.
There's also a VESA adapter option that lets you mount the display in landscape or
portrait orientation. Studio Display features an expansive screen that has a 27-inch
active area with a total of 14.7 million pixels at 218 pixels per inch, making it a 5K
Retina display. And with 600 nits of brightness, P3 wide color, and support for over a
billion colors, it brings images to life with spectacular detail. It also has True Tone for
a more natural viewing experience, plus an industry-leading anti-reﬂective coating,
for better comfort and readability. And for studios with bright light sources, there's
an innovative nano-texture glass option that scatters light to further minimize glare,
while delivering outstanding image quality.
Another thing that makes Studio Display unique is the fact that it actually has an A13
Bionic chip inside, which enables it to deliver amazing experiences with a highly
advanced camera and audio system. There's a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide camera,
which is the same sensational camera that's been a huge hit on iPad. And powered
by the incredible technology in Apple silicon, it supports Center Stage, which comes
to the Mac for the very ﬁrst time, so video calls are so much more engaging. And to
make this the ultimate video conferencing display, it also includes an array of studio-
quality mics. They have an especially low noise ﬂoor for crystal-clear calls.
Studio Display also features a high-ﬁdelity six-speaker sound system that delivers an
unbelievable listening experience. It has four force-cancelling woofers that minimize
distortion and produce bold, articulate bass and two high-performance tweeters that
create accurate mids and crisp highs. And because Apple silicon can process multi-
channel surround sound, the speakers also support Spatial Audio for music and
video with Dolby Atmos, creating a truly cinematic viewing experience. Simply put,
these are, by far, the highest ﬁdelity speakers we've ever created for the Mac. And
this is the best combination of camera and audio ever in a desktop display.
Next, let's talk about how Studio Display connects with your other devices. It has
three USB-C ports that deliver speeds up to 10 gigabits per second. So you can
connect peripherals, storage, and networking right into the display. And there's a
Thunderbolt port, which allows you to connect Studio Display and any plugged in
peripherals to your Mac with a single cable. That same cable delivers 96 watts of
power, which allows you to charge any Mac notebook, and it can even fast charge a
14-inch MacBook Pro. And you can connect up to three Studio Displays to your
MacBook Pro, creating an incredible edit bay or 3D animation studio.
Finally, to complete your setup, we've added a new silver and black color option to
the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, the Magic Trackpad, and the Magic Mouse, which
beautifully complement the design of the display. Studio Display has also been
designed to minimize its environmental impact. It uses 100% recycled rare earth
elements in all magnets and is free of numerous harmful substances. It also meetsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

other display has this unique oﬀering of 5K Retina resolution and advanced camera
with Center Stage and incredibly high ﬁdelity audio, all in a reﬁned, aluminum
design. And it's a great display to pair with any Mac, like MacBook Pro, MacBook Air,
Mac mini, and of course, Mac Studio. Now, before I hand it back to John, let's take a
look at Mac Studio and Studio Display in action. (Video Presentation)

So that's Mac Studio and Studio Display. With incredible performance, extensive
connectivity, and a modular design, Mac Studio with M1 Max starts at $1,999. And
Mac Studio with M1 Ultra starts at $3,999. No other desktop in the world can oﬀer this
level of performance and capability at this price. And the Studio Display, with its
awesome set of features, is $1,599. And it can be conﬁgured with nano-texture glass
and a choice of stand options. You can order both products today and they'll be
available on March 18.
Today, we built upon the amazing capabilities of M1 Max with the introduction of M1
Ultra. With its UltraFusion architecture, powerful CPU, massive GPU, and staggering
memory bandwidth, it's the next giant leap for Apple silicon. And we introduced Mac
Studio, which was designed to put all this groundbreaking performance right on
your desk. Together with the Studio Display, these products will empower users to
create the studios of their dreams and continue to change the world. And they join
the rest of our incredible Mac lineup with Apple silicon, making our transition nearly
complete, with just one more product to go, Mac Pro, but that is for another day.
Now, back to Tim.

We've had an extraordinary relationship with the world's creative community, and
the Mac has been such an important tool for these users. We're excited to bring
them an entirely new system, Mac Studio and Studio Display, and to see all of the
amazing things they will do with it. It's remarkable to think about the profound
impact Apple silicon is having on the Mac and our other products. The A15 Bionic
drives the most powerful phones in the world: iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro. And
today we introduced two striking new green ﬁnishes. The new iPhone SE, our most
aﬀordable iPhone, is also now powered by the incredible A15 Bionic chip. The new
iPad Air takes a big leap with the M1 chip, as well as 5G, Center Stage, and beautiful
new ﬁnishes.
It's truly remarkable what Apple silicon makes possible. It delivers industry-leading
performance, technologies, and advancements, and the seamless integration of
hardware and software enables us to provide experiences that no one else can. We
look forward to seeing what our users will do with all of these incredible products
and the impact they will have on people's lives. Thank you again for joining us. Have
a great day.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08
