Thank you, Brett. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning to talk about
this very exciting announcement. I want to brieﬂy discuss what this acquisition will
mean for both Microsoft and for Nuance.
For us, everything starts with our mission to empower every person in every
organization on the planet to achieve more. Microsoft and Nuance both share a
passion for ensuring people everywhere and the institutions they build are
beneﬁting from the latest advances in digital technology. We are both partner-ﬁrstFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12

have complete solutions they need to address their unique challenges. Together
with our partners, we will put advanced AI solutions into the hands of professionals
to drive better decision-making and create more meaningful human connections.
First and foremost, this coming together is about empowering health care. It's about
applying the technology, talent, industry expertise and partner mindset of our two
companies to this very critical industry in order to empower everyone from ISVs to
EHR vendors, to physicians, nurses and, of course, patients.
Coming out of the pandemic, we are experiencing digital transformation at a scale
never seen before. Entire industries are being reimagined in mere months. This is
driving lasting structural change and accelerating digital transformation driven by
industry-speciﬁc cloud solutions.
It's now very clear that healthcare organizations that accelerate their digital
investments can improve patient outcomes and reduce costs at scale. Advances such
as AI will have an enormous impact on augmenting human capability in healthcare.
AI is technology's most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent
application.
That's why we are so energized by today's announcement. Nuance is a pioneer in
enterprise AI, and it's the AI layer at the healthcare point of delivery. Nuance created
the voice recognition category more than 20 years ago. Its technology is deeply
integrated with solutions, medical professionals use all day every day. 77% of US
hospitals are Nuance customers. Three out of four radiologists in the United States
use Nuance to improve their eﬀectiveness. And more broadly, 85% of the Fortune
100 use Nuance, applying AI to connect with their customers in new ways and
protect them with advanced biometric security.
Nuance has great momentum in cloud and AI ﬁrst solutions in three key areas. First,
ambient clinical intelligence. Nuance's Dragon Ambient eXperience solution has
completely redeﬁned clinical documentation by capturing and contextualizing every
word of the physician/patient encounter and automatically documenting it in the
EHR. Deep learning securely converts conversations into structured notes tailored to
each medical specialty. This clinical documentation essentially writes itself, giving
physicians time back to focus on patient care. It's a fantastic example of how AI and
cloud computing are being embedded in the world today, whilst preserving trust,
security and privacy. This is projected to be one of the fastest-growing infrastructure
software revenue streams in history.
Second, healthcare cloud. More broadly through its integrations with core healthcare
systems like EHR, Nuance is moving key workﬂows in radiology, healthcare, speech
recognition and medical coding to the cloud, reducing the burden on clinicians and
delivering better clinical and ﬁnancial outcomes. For example, Nuance is creating
powerful feedback loops across the entire AI layer, connecting workﬂows, care
pathways, quality reviews and EHR integrations to support critical clinical decisionFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 8Mark Benjaminmaking. Think of this as an AI learning loop for continuous improvement for every
provider.
And ﬁnally, cross-industry enterprise AI, speciﬁcally customer engagement and
biometric security. Nuance is building the next-generation omni-channel customer
engagement cloud service at a time when every business is re-imagining how it
interacts with customers. Nuance is also applying AI to security with biometric
security solutions to authenticate customers and prevent fraud. 8 billion
authentications are enabled by Nuance's biometric services annually, and 31 billion
customer interactions ﬂow through their solutions each year.
Today, the Microsoft Cloud is diﬀerentiated and is leading with industry and cross-
industry solutions and our opportunity is to take Nuance's momentum and add
Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare. Six months ago, we introduced the Microsoft Cloud
for Healthcare, which brings together the breadth of our oﬀerings and adds new
capabilities, customizations and standards unique to the industry. Nuance and
Microsoft complete the end-to-end patient-provider workﬂow, capturing the patient
interaction, converting into clinical documentation and conducting follow-up actions.
Together, Nuance's momentum and growth in these key areas, paired with
Microsoft's scale across the enterprise, will increase our total addressable market
and expand our AI leadership. Nuance will double our TAM in healthcare provider
space and increase our TAM across healthcare to nearly $500 billion [ph]. This
acquisition brings our technology directly into the physician/patient loop, which is
central to all healthcare delivery.
The acquisition will also expand our leadership in cross-industry enterprise AI and
biometric security. Nuance is a recognized leader in conversational AI for intelligent
customer engagement through interactive voice response, virtual assistants and
voice biometrics. Most importantly, together, we will drive increased customer
beneﬁts by augmenting the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare with Nuance and by
combining Nuance's deep enterprise AI expertise with the Microsoft Cloud, we will
deliver powerful next-generation services and accelerate the growth of Nuance's
business and drive growth across our complete tech stack.
I'm greatly looking forward to empowering our customers together and the new
opportunities we will create with them. To share more, I will turn it over to Nuance's
CEO, Mark Benjamin. Mark?
{BIO 16617270 <GO>}
Thank you, Satya. At Nuance, we focus on creating intelligent solutions that amplify
our customers' ability to help others [ph]. From revolutionizing the doctor-patient
relationship to reinventing the way large organizations connect with their customers,
Nuance is a leader in conversational AI and ambient clinical intelligence. We have
pioneered speech technologies, natural language understanding and machine
learning for more than 20 years. So AI is certainly in our DNA.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12

Page 4 of 8Over the past three years, we've gone through a transformation to streamline our
portfolio, transition to the cloud, and reinvigorate our purpose around healthcare
and enterprise AI to deliver solutions that shape the future of work and care. We are
redeﬁning how work gets done in these areas, making our customers more eﬃcient,
more eﬀective, more productive and more engaged.
For healthcare, we are in a critical moment where the industry's most pressing needs
demand innovative responses and leadership from the marketplace. The clinicians,
administrators and care teams at health organizations face challenges that multiply
and intensify every year, making it increasingly diﬃcult for providers to deliver
consistently high quality care. Clinician burnout, declining patient satisfaction,
increased ﬁnancial pressures, growing administrative demands and obstacles to
eﬀective care delivery, these have profound repercussions on patient care. And the
pandemic has made ﬁnding solutions to these problems even more imperative.
Beyond healthcare and across a range of industries, enterprises are consistently
looking for omni-channel intelligent engagement technologies to address the
current challenges around customer experience. Technologies like advanced voice-
enabled solutions can help them facilitate more personal, aﬀordable and eﬀective
connections. Our desire to address these challenges with powerful solutions was
what led to the partnership with Microsoft about 1.5 years ago. Recognizing our
distinctive areas of expertise are highly complementary, we brought together our AI
and cloud technologies to accelerate the delivery of ambient clinical intelligence,
which improves the lives of healthcare professionals and enhances the overall quality
of patient care.
Over the course of our partnership, we launched our ambient clinical intelligence
solution that Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience, or DAX for short, on Microsoft
Azure. And then amid the unprecedented migrations to remote care during the
pandemic, we further collaborated to rapidly create an integration for Nuance DAX
with Microsoft Teams to broadly scale virtual concerts.
Nuance is already a leader in conversational AI and ambient clinical intelligence, and
our successful partnership with Microsoft provides us a unique opportunity to further
build on our position and reach in healthcare in key enterprise verticals globally. For
more than 20 years, we have built deep domain expertise across industries,
including healthcare, ﬁnancial services, telecommunications, retail, government and
more. As Satya touched on, our industry-leading products serve large enterprises
across the Fortune 100, and our healthcare solutions empower more than 550,000
physicians and 10,000 global healthcare organizations.
We are also taking the lead in redeﬁning the paradigm of the 21st century healthcare
by entering care delivery on the patient/physician experience. DAX enables the
physician to focus completely on the patient by providing clinical documentation
that writes itself. Nuance's solutions work seamlessly with core healthcare systems,
including long-standing relationships with electronic health records or EHRs, to
alleviate the burden of clinical documentation and empower providers to deliver
better patient experiences.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12

Page 5 of 8Scott GuthrieBeyond our clinical -- clinician-focused solution, our PowerScribe One solution is a
leading solution for radiology reports. We continue to expand our portfolio of
radiology solutions with added intelligence to increase follow-up compliance and
clinical best practices. And we foresee plenty of room to grow. Our healthcare cloud
grew 37% last ﬁscal year, and we project continued momentum over the next couple
of years. And beyond the healthcare sector, the large organizations, we see
powering intelligent engagement with voice, digital and biometric solutions as a way
that creates superior customer experiences, while reducing cost for the enterprise.
With the backdrop of this dynamic period of transformation for healthcare, any
business organization worldwide had belief strongly that scaling and formalizing the
partnership with Microsoft at this moment is the best business, strategic and
economic decision. Formally joining forces will amplify our ability to deliver products
that shape the future of work, help solve healthcare's most pressing challenges, and
bring compelling value to our customers. And with Microsoft's cloud infrastructure,
we can get our solutions to the doctors' hands even faster. Equally important, our
highly diﬀerentiated AI applications will advance Microsoft's cloud strategy. And
together, we will be able to address even more opportunities to signiﬁcantly
accelerate the application of AI and speech recognition, natural language
processing and intelligent engagement across the industries.
We can reach healthcare systems globally in a way we cannot easily reach them
before. At the same time, this combination oﬀers a critical opportunity to deliver
meaningful and certain value to our shareholders, who have driven and supported
us on this journey.
In a world where technology innovation, the speed of change, cloud accessibility
and scale are key diﬀerentiators to our customers, together, we have an
extraordinary opportunity to deﬁne the future and accelerate the reach of our
technology and our ambitions. In many ways, our reasons for coming together 18
months ago are the same reasons that we believe we can do even more by oﬃcially
joining forces today. Our belief in the power of this combination has only gotten
stronger as the changes and challenges in the critical industries we serve have
continued to evolve.
With that, over to you, Scott.
{BIO 15931914 <GO>}
Thank you, Mark. As you can tell, we're incredibly excited about today's
announcement. Building on the strategic alignment that Satya and Mark outlined
and the impact we're already making together, I'd like to highlight a few additional
areas of opportunity, both in healthcare and for every industry. Let's take a closer
look at a few of these scenarios.
If you visited a doctor's oﬃce in the US recently, chances are good that your
physician used Nuance solutions to document your visit. After you went home, they
probably spent time speaking their notes into a solution like Nuance's DragonFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 8Medical One, a speech recognition solution built on Microsoft Azure and tailored for
healthcare. In the future, we can bring Nuance's deep domain expertise and the
relationships with core healthcare systems like EHR, electronic health records,
together with Microsoft's advanced AI capabilities. By augmenting Microsoft's Cloud
for Healthcare solution with Nuance's technology, healthcare providers will be able
to spend more time focusing on patients, not paperwork, and continue to optimize
the ﬂow of the day-to-day work.
Beyond speech recognition, we see an opportunity to empower providers further
with ambient clinical intelligence, which is exactly what we're doing with the Nuance
Dragon Ambient eXperience. Mark talked about the incredible impact that DAX is
having in the marketplace today, including the integration with Microsoft Teams to
provide ambient clinical intelligence during telehealth visits. We're excited about this
technology and proud that it's already running on Microsoft Azure.
In the future, we believe we can further scale DAX through Microsoft's global
presence as well as further enhance the product through our deep AI capabilities,
unlocking additional opportunities across the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare. We
envision a wide range of AI-enabled services tapping into our best-in-class Azure AI
capabilities and leveraging our existing healthcare integrations like the Azure API for
Fire.
When I see DAX in action, it's also clear that this technology can be applied beyond
healthcare, and Microsoft can do that. We can bring this understanding of
conversations to other industries that rely on that same modality. As just one
example, think about conversations you could have with your ﬁnancial advisor,
where ambient AI could document the plan and suggest next steps to your ﬁnancial
advisor. Nearly any professional service could beneﬁt from real-time engagement
converted into material intelligence that drives actions. Every customer I talk to is
looking to make the right decision at the right time for all of their stakeholders.
Nowhere is this more true than in physician/patient engagement. We believe AI can
help.
There's one critical scenario we can look at as an example: medical imaging. Medical
imaging makes up a staggering portion of all healthcare data. Going back to that
hypothetical doctor's visit, if you had an X-Ray taken, it's very likely the radiologists
who review the image are already using Nuance to create the radiology report. In the
future through our combined AI expertise, healthcare industry expertise and strong
partner ecosystems, we can work with our partners in medical imaging to deliver AI
and computer vision services for radiologists that reduce the time from imaging to
diagnosis and diagnosis to treatment and add value throughout the imaging
workﬂow.
Beyond healthcare, Nuance and Microsoft can take their combined AI expertise to all
industries. By bringing conversational AI solutions, like interactive voice response,
together with the breadth and depth of Microsoft's cloud portfolio, we believe we'll
be able to deliver AI-driven digital engagement solutions for any industry scenario.
Microsoft solutions like Dynamics 365 or Teams, can be augmented with new AI-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12

Nuance's biometric security expertise can bring new capabilities to solutions like
Dynamics 365 fraud protection, enabling true omnichannel end-to-end fraud
protection for businesses and individuals alike.
In addition to these speciﬁc scenarios, we see structural opportunities as well. Let me
touch on a few. With Microsoft's global cloud infrastructure, we will enable dramatic
global scale for Nuance technology. Our partner ecosystems will be able to build
diﬀerentiated solutions, leveraging both Microsoft and Nuance capabilities, whether
working with leading EHR providers, like Epic and Cerner, or leading partners in
other industries. Microsoft's ﬁeld and distribution channels will enable us to reach
new customers in new segments and geographies, broadening the reach of
Nuance's technologies beyond the United States.
And this is just the beginning of what we envision together. We're excited about the
opportunity to empower healthcare providers and advance our AI leadership across
every industry with this acquisition.
To close this out, let me hand it over to Amy Hood.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thanks, Scott. Over the past seven years, we've taken a consistent approach to
mergers and acquisitions of all sizes. We focus on TAM-expansive opportunities in
high-growth markets, where we can uniquely add value to the users or the
community. And we execute those transactions at a price that supports long-term
shareholder value creation. As Satya, Mark and Scott discussed, Nuance meets those
criteria. And with all acquisitions, value was ultimately only created with terriﬁc
execution, buying aligned team with a shared vision of the future. For this, key
indicators of our success will be accelerated topline growth of Nuance's business
and starting with Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, increased adoption of Azure, Teams
and Dynamics 365 across industries.
Now let's turn to the transaction details. We've agreed to acquire Nuance for $56 per
share, implying a 23% premium to Nuance's closing price on April 9th, in an all-cash
transaction valued at $19.7 billion. The acquisition will not impact our previously-
announced share buyback program. The transaction has been unanimously
approved by the Boards of Directors of both Microsoft and Nuance. The transaction
is intended to close by the end of this calendar year, subject to approval by Nuance
shareholders and the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other
customary closing conditions.
On a non-GAAP basis, we anticipate the transaction will be minimally dilutive or less
than 1% to EPS in FY '22 and accretive in FY '23. In this context, non-GAAP excludes
the expected impact of purchase accounting adjustments as well as the integration
and transaction-related expenses. Following the close of the transaction, we expect
to report results for Nuance in our Intelligent Cloud segment, and Mark Benjamin
will remain CEO of Nuance, reporting to Scott Guthrie.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12
