Hi, everyone. We're going to get started, Can everyone hear me? Hello, we're going
to start the afternoon session now. We're very happy to have Doug McMillon here
with us, Chief Executive of Walmart. You need really no further introduction than that,
so I will turn it over to you for...
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
My name is Doug and working with Walmart. I'm excited to be here and have a
conversation. Kate, it was kind of to give me just a minute to kick it oﬀ. So if you were
with us in Florida at our Investor Conference there earlier in the year and we talked
about the opportunities that we've got from the investments we've got looking
ahead, and the fact that we believe we can continue to grow sales, grow operating
income faster than sales, and improve return on investment as we go. I'll just quickly
repeat, as it relates to driving that topline we feel well-positioned with brick-and-
mortar, with stores and clubs, with curbside pickup, and with various forms of
delivery, we expect to be able to continue to drive growth because we can serve
people how they want to be served.
Operating income gets mixed up over time through the combination of productivity
improvements, largely fueled by investments in automation and by changing the
shape of the business model. As we've been able to scale digitally and drive
eCommerce, grow a marketplace business, grow an ad business, grow data
monetization, fulﬁllment services, not only in the U.S., but in other markets, the shape
of the income statement itself changes. And then thirdly, because operating income
is going up, we've got an opportunity to grow ROI as we go. So no new updates as it
relates to the algorithm we've been using or the strategy, it's very consistent and I'm
feeling very repetitive these days.

Doug McMillonIt's good repetition now, it's all good news. So thank you again for joining us. We do
have a bunch of questions really focused on the algo and proﬁtability, but I thought
we could start ﬁrst with just a state of the consumer. Just given your size and scale,
can you talk about maybe the evolution of what you've seen this year with the
consumer and how do you feel that the health of the consumer is going into the
back half?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, we today operate at 19 [ph] diﬀerent countries and we see commonality across
those markets in terms of how people are feeling and behaving. In the U.S., things
are better than I would have expected them to be when we started the year. I was
concerned about the amount of inﬂation in categories like dry grocery and
consumables, how that would impact discretionary purchases, had an eye on the
consumer balance sheet, all those things that we were all thinking about at the
beginning of the year, but things have held up better than I would have guessed,
and I think the employment situation, wage increases, some pockets of disinﬂation
are helping that. So we do see some behavioral change for some customers that are
particularly pressured from a budget point-of-view.
We do see pack size changes, moves to private brand, all those kinds of things that
you historically have heard us talk about, but not everybody is in the same situation,
and in our case, we've been able to attract customers across income cohorts, which
has improved our situation as we've been able to grow share. So I'm feeling pretty
good about where the consumer is in the U.S. and encouraged by what happened
with back-to-school, as we reported at the end of the second quarter, back-to-school
started oﬀ strong and normally that means that holiday is going to be good. So I feel
pretty good about the back half and our position in it.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
That's great. And on the last call, you did sound more optimistic about general
merchandise in particular, could you maybe talk about still down, but in terms of
what you're seeing, is there a way to discern maybe how much is the shift in
prioritization? How much is the -- just the easier compare of the LAP and again, how
should we think about bigger ticket items when it comes to general merchandise?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. Lots of variables moving around and when we started the second quarter, what
I was expecting general merchandise to look like was more negative in terms of
percent of total than how it turned out to be. So on the call, I was talking about the
fact that general merchandise was better than I expected. One of the things that's
happening is general merchandise prices are coming down and we've seen food
and dry grocery, think of the dry grocery, consumables, paper goods, cleaning
supplies, that level of pricing has leveled out to an extent, and with that combined
with the lower prices in general merchandise and the strength of our customers
overall, performance was better in general merchandise than I would have thought it
would have been.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12

Doug McMillonFood and consumables have still gone up as a percent of total and I think that will
continue through the year, but our thoughts are forecasted of what we thought GM
[ph] was going to look like for the year, we were worse than what's actually
happening. And I do think that, having seen the assortment for Halloween,
Christmas, and the holidays, I think we're in a pretty good spot and that customers
are going to feel some relief as it relates to pricing, Take the toy category, for
example, some price points driven up over a two year period and as I look at the
pricing for the balance of the year, we've got some great price points in toys and I
think that's going to help us drive demand and that's true in some other general
merchandise categories as well.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
And could you maybe talk a little bit about how general merchandise has evolved
for you over the last couple of years, because that was the focus on the Q2 call as
well in terms of the investments you've made there and how that's changed?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
That's our heritage. Most of my career was spent in merchandising and general
merchandise categories and we love those categories. Obviously, food and
consumables are important to us, but we want to sell the whole basket, and we've
got opportunities in apparel and home, in particular, to have a bigger business and a
bigger percent to total higher market share and that's a combination of what
happened in-stores and online. If I take the Walmart US supercenters, the
opportunity we have with our remodels to improve our apparel presentation and I
hope many of you've seen those stores and those remodels, it's a great one, and the
better we do in terms of in-store presentation and product, think of good, better,
best merchandising, the more that opens up opportunities for us in eCommerce,
both in ﬁrst-party and third-party. So when I think about general merchandise, I think
about omni, in-stores, and e-com and it's 1P and 3P and the growth that we've seen
on the marketplace side into merchandise has been terriﬁc. I expect that momentum
will continue. So customers can really ﬁnd what they're looking for across the entire
breadth of our assortment, which causes organic repeat to happen on our app.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. I thought maybe we could just touch on grocery quickly since I already spoke
about general merchandise, but it seems like the promotional environment within
grocery is still seeing so much rationale, and just as an EDLP retailer, how are you
thinking about your relative price position today and maintaining your GAAP when it
comes to -- pricing GAAP when it comes to grocery?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, in Walmart US, we're in good shape. Those of you that follow us closely know
that over the last few years we've made a lot of investments on the income statement
side with lower prices, some higher wages, eCommerce investments, and
technology investments, and as it relates to those, we're in pretty good shape nowFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12

Doug McMillonand we're maintaining price gaps, and suppliers bring us -- think of dry grocery,
consumables, as well as general merchandise, including direct imports, they bring us
cost increases and decreases and we manage those up and down, and of course, we
want to help customers save money and live better, so we're looking for the
opportunity to drive rollbacks, but when that all plays out we end-up with about the
same price gap and about the same margin structure on the income statement side.
So today's Walmart is really focused on investments in things like automation and
the balance sheet side of the equation more so than we were previously.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
And when it comes to deﬂation on the grocery side, how do you expect to manage
that?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I think it will be slow. We'd like for us to see the opportunity for customers to have
more disinﬂation and have lower prices faster. What we've seen over the last few
years has resulted in dry grocery and consumables have a -- having a pretty big two-
year stack inﬂation number and that's coming down a little bit, but not a lot. On the
general merchandise side, things ﬂipped faster. General merchandise prices are
lower than they were a year ago, but not as low as they were two years ago. I don't
think that GM gets all the way back down to two-year ago prices. And I certainly
don't think that's going to happen on the food and consumable side. So when this is
all said and done, there has been a bit of rebalancing as it relates to higher wages in
the country. Inﬂation and higher prices are kind of with us. We'll see disinﬂation, but
not all the way back to deﬂation, I don't believe, certainly not in the short-term.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay, right. We started the conversation with your proﬁtability algorithm and we
think that's one of the most compelling parts of the Walmart long-term growth story
is that improving proﬁtability proﬁle that we feel like we're just starting to see, of all
the improvements, whether it be new business, improving eCommerce, lapping
investment, what would you say is the tipping point to ﬁnally be getting to this part
of your story?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I think it's happening quarter-to-quarter. I think you're seeing that play-out right
before your eyes and it won't happen all at once, it won't happen overnight. The ﬁrst
thing that goes through my mind is how excited that I am and we are about the
supply chain investments. I've been doing this now for more than 32 years and I've
never seen an opportunity to step change the supply chain like the one that's right in
front of us. And it's happening with the way we use data. It's happening with
increasingly intelligent algorithms to help with demand forecasting and inventory
optimization and it's happening with robotics. Speciﬁcally, automated storage and
retrieval systems placed into our ambient DC network, our perishable distribution
center network, our eCommerce fulﬁllment centers, and our market fulﬁllmentFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 13Kate McShane
Doug McMilloncenters that will be on locations with many of our stores. When you put those things
together, we touched the product a lot less, our accuracy is a lot higher. Productivity
will go up in the back room of the store as we receive freight that is palletized and
more accurate as it relates to what's needed in a department or an aisle over time.
That is a change that we've dreamt about and haven't been capable of doing,
although for seven years now, we've been working with partners to ﬁgure out how to
make the automated storage and retrieval systems work. And now it seems like
we've got a pretty high degree of certainty as it relates to the individual projects as
investments with a high and attractive IRR, but also the cumulative beneﬁt of the way
that new system gets put in place.
So when I think about operating income growing faster than sales, the ﬁrst thing that
I think about is how we manage inventory and the opportunity with the supply chain
to increase productivity, so that we can have low prices, not have the customer pay
for any of that and have an opportunity to reinvest or to ﬂow through to a higher
operating income level. The second component is the way that e-commerce has
played out, the way digital has played out, and the impact that has on our income
statement. So frequently inside the company, I'll describe it as the old income
statement, looks like a store P&L. It gets sales, gross margin, SG&A, and operating
income percentage at the bottom. The new income statement has got gross
merchandise value, GMV, our marketplace, membership, advertising, fulﬁllment
services, data monetization, and other components, that second income statement
required a period of investment to scale e-commerce, 1P and 3P. We've made a lot of
progress doing that. And what happened in 2020 and 2021 accelerated that
progress, ﬁxed-cost got leveraged more and contribution proﬁt changed because of
apparel and home percent of total going up and also because of the 1P, 3P mix. So
that second income statement looks healthier, faster than we would have guessed,
and in the end, it has a higher operating income percentage than the ﬁrst income
statement.
So when you hear us talk about business model change at Walmart, it's simply taking
the previous income statement, still running that store business, becoming better
and better at that over time, building that second one, adding them to gather to get
a third business model and income statement that looks diﬀerent than the ﬁrst two.
That's mentally how I think about it and that shift enables us to have a higher level of
proﬁtability as a percent of total without having to raise prices for anybody. It's just a
business model change. So when you put together automation, productivity plus the
business model shift, you get a more sustainable business that can grow more
eﬀectively over time and mix itself up as a (inaudible).
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
And if we could maybe focus a little bit on the second income statement, starting
with marketplace. Could you talk a little bit about how marketplace is diﬀerent than
maybe your competitors of how it's diﬀerentiated? And could you just discuss the
fulﬁllment of marketplace and how you're approaching that?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 13Kate McShane
Doug McMillonYeah. First on the fulﬁllment side, to have a great customer experience we want to
fulﬁll more of those orders and so we've been building capacity over the last few
years to be able to provide fulﬁllment services to a greater degree and that's
happening, and that will continue to happen over time. More of the marketplace
business will be conducted through our own fulﬁllment centers. We think that our
marketplace is growing at a healthy rate and it results in the customer being able to
have choice. When somebody thinks about buying anything and they want to go
search or they want to go ﬁnd a speciﬁc item, we want to be in that consideration set
and that requires 1P and 3P. And now if you look at Walmart US, it's about 400
million items. We think of the marketplace as being global, not just geographic. The
marketplace has cross-border aspects. We have a marketplace opportunity in
Canada and Chile and Mexico, not just the U.S., so I think marketplace is being more
of an enterprise in global business. That has been picking up momentum. We are
fairly disciplined about screening sellers to make sure that the customer experience
is good. So relative to some others, the vetting [ph] process, kind of like a bank goes
through KYC, we want to know who the seller is. We want to measure transactional
NPS and know that the outcome for our customers and members is a high-quality
outcome, and that does get helped by fulﬁllment services. So we can scale it. We can
go up in terms of the item count, the seller count, in terms of GMV and proﬁtability,
but do that in a healthy and sustainable way and that's what we're out to accomplish.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. The next pillar or area is Walmart Connect and we wanted to ask about in
terms of, again, that second income statement, which continues to have very strong
growth. Could you talk about the opportunity in the U.S. for Walmart Connect and
internationally? And is there a proﬁtability ramp in terms of what it will contribute
over time?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. Great opportunity with advertising globally and we're excited that we're in that
business and we have some diﬀerentiated oﬀers for people, including the fact that
you can serve up an ad to someone and have an opportunity to know a week -- two
weeks later if they transacted in a store and not everybody can do that. So omni has
some advantages as it relates to why you would want to invest in advertising dollar
with us. To be clear on our priorities, we want to be where America shops. We want
to be where Canadians shop. We're not out to have a short-term orientation, driving
advertising up in a way to try and maximize something like CLTV [ph] in a way that in
the long-term hurts the customer relationship and hurts the company. So we think
about how often we serve up an ad and the way that shows up. And obviously,
generative AI is going to change things. Personalization is going to improve. We
think our advertising rollout is going to continue to go up. but we want to grow that
in a healthy way. So I think ﬁrst about 1P, 3P growth, is the eCommerce growing, we
sell ads to suppliers, we sell ads to marketplace sellers. We want to drive growth on
both sides so that the advertising business grows and scales and it will, but keep it in
the right order of prioritization so that we don't end up harming the customer and
member experience negatively and end up regretting that at the end of the day. So
we grew 35% last quarter. We're excited about the ad business. It's not what I get up
in the morning and think about ﬁrst. What I think about ﬁrst is did we serveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12

Kate McShanecustomers and members well. What was the sales growth number? What was the
GMV number? And advertising gets pulled along through that topline growth.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. The third area in terms of proﬁtability is fulﬁllment, so separate from what I just
asked with marketplace, but just kind of fulﬁllment on its own, you've been very
much front-footed in terms of how customers get their purchases with the click-and-
collect still being a fastest-growing option, what is the next phase and fulﬁllment if
you had to guess how proﬁtable can it be and can you build this out to serve other
businesses and retailers?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I think we have already demonstrated that we can serve third-parties, whether it's last
mile or it's fulﬁllment services, and that will just continue to get bigger within the U.S.
and in some of the other markets that we've got. That automation that I've described
will play out through that system. The Last Mile delivery network gets built out, will
own more vehicles, will have associates doing more deliveries. Right now, the
number of associate deliveries is relatively small -- very small compared to what
happens with independent contractors on various platforms including the Spark
platform that we operate for independent contractors to do deliveries, which is the
biggest portion of our delivery business in the U.S. at the moment. So, I think about
the whole system that I described earlier and the fact that others can join and use
that system and gain beneﬁts by doing so. When we can have a last mile order that's
bigger or more orders and denser fashion, everybody wins, and we're able to help
other retailers, large and small, participate in that systemic change to the supply
chain that we're building out. So I think that just gets bigger and more important
with us keeping the ﬁrst thing ﬁrst, which is transactional NPS for our customers and
members to know that they're happy to shop with us.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
And then the last piece that we wanted to ask when it comes to proﬁtability is data
and loyalty membership, Walmart+. I think since you launched Walmart+ a couple of
years ago, and I'm not going to ask you for a number (multiple speakers)
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
You kind of just did.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
I'm not going to. But you've added more beneﬁts to the programs such as travel
beneﬁts with Expedia and Paramount+, how are you thinking about the program's
overall oﬀering now versus peers? And any color on the shopping habits of who
these numbers are, what they buy versus traditional customer?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 13Doug McMillon
Kate McShane
Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
We want to have more members and we want that because we don't want them to
think about delivery charges, we just want them to shop with us, and we want to use
the data to try and serve them better. So personalization can improve. The more we
have a unique identiﬁer for a household or person, so that's important to us. We try
not to emphasize membership, not just in the U.S., but in other countries because it's
just one component of what we do and we don't want to accidentally create some
short-hand where you all value our whole company based on that singular metric,
which we've seen happen with some other other companies, so I don't know if we'll
ever talk about what the actual number looks like. And they're going to be diﬀerent
types of memberships, not only at Walmart but at Sam's Club and other places. So
the behavior we're looking for is organic repeat and bigger share. We want to sell
across the basket. We want to sell across not only the store assortment but the
eCommerce assortment and across 1P and 3P, and when you have a membership
and you build this relationship both directions, you just end up with more repeat in a
bigger wallet share and that's the way that we want to grow this thing. But again, like
everything else, we want to grow it in a healthy sustainable way. So you'll see us, as
we have been doing, stay really focused on the customer experience. For quite a
while, you heard me and others saying, we don't want to grow Walmart+ too fast
because we want to make sure that the customer experience is high-quality. And as
we built that capacity, we've got better store pick and we put -- started putting more
automation in place. I think the opportunity to grow that faster is here and we'll be
here going forward, but again, it's just one piece of what we're doing.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. So going from membership to Sam's, since that is our membership model, it's
displayed a lot of momentum over the past few years. Trends have remained really
strong. You just announced a leadership change there. Can you talk a little bit about
what you're seeing in that business? Why you think the sustainability of demand is
sustaining and why is now the right time to open new clubs?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
The momentum of Sam's for years now has been so encouraging and I think it's
earned. I think environmental things changed, 2021, 2022, there were things that
happened that caused that format to do well, but it was more than that. The
remodels that were done inside Sam's Club, Bold & Blue [ph], what Kath and the
team did was great. It really refreshed that experience. But more importantly, the
merchandise got better. What Kath McLay and the team did, Megan Crozier with
Member's Mark, private brand has been terriﬁc. Just one out at time, newness,
quality, I'm addicted to some Sam's Club membership Member's Mark items and I'll
always buy membership because I want the cashews, I want the mixed nuts, I want
fresh squeezed orange juice, I want the prepared meals, there are things that we just
have to have as a family and I think that's been happening with members more
broadly. And we did take a pause, opening new units in Walmart US and in Sam's
and focused on e-commerce and some other things. During that period of time,
there has been some relocation in the country, there are opportunities in places likeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12

Doug McMillonTexas and Florida, where we can easily see that we need buildings and so we're
excited about the opportunity to have a number of new units go in in addition to the
investments we're making in remodels and automation.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
And is that new units both in Sam's Club and Walmart US?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I think we've announced Sam's Club openings. I'm trying not to make any
announcements here today.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay, I'm sorry.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
But what I just said applies that geographically there are opportunities for new
buildings.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay, thank you. And then, we want to ask about international. Walmart divested a
couple of international regions a few years ago, but it's been displaying growth in
those segments that you have retained. Can you talk about what you're seeing in
your core markets and how your alternative value streams applied to this segment,
you touched on that a little bit, but?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. I've been traveling, I was saying to Kate earlier, internationally, lately, I've been
in Canada and Chile, and I've been talking to the team in Mexico, went to India not
too long ago and more than ever we are working on very common strategies. And
when you hear our teams talk from around the world, they say the same things and
generally the same order, which unlocks opportunities to create tech that applies
everywhere faster and better, particularly the Americas, Canada, the U.S., Mexico,
down to Chile, the omni strategy, the components of it. Stores, clubs, a brick-and-
mortar business, and eCommerce business, 1P, 3P, marketplace, advertising business,
fulﬁllment services, it's the same stuﬀ. And so whereas in the past, we grew through
acquisitions and we picked up all these diﬀerent tech stacks. We've been working for
years to create commonality there that will enable us to take things like Project Glass
in the U.S. when we launched our new app and we put together grocery pickup and
the broader assortment on the Blue app, that piece of tech applies in all these other
countries. So we're getting faster at scaling those across. India is a little diﬀerent.
China is a little diﬀerent, but the countries I just mentioned, can have a ton ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12

Doug McMilloncommonality. So there's more opportunity for innovation, speed, productivity by
leveraging those things one time across.
So I was responsible for International when we were in all those other markets and
what Judith McKenna has done with international last six years has been fantastic.
And we kind of know that there is power and focus and then if you exit some
markets that it will show up, it's a little hard to model sometimes, like how much
would it really help you. But I can tell you now having look back at exiting those
markets has really helped us. And we're in a great set of markets right now with more
upside in terms of growth. The proﬁle of our International business on the top-line
and bottom-line looks really diﬀerent than it did a few years ago and that tech
leverage is going to be part of the secret sauce to achieving all of that and helping
the U.S. businesses at the same time.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. We're at the point where we're asking four questions to all the companies that
present here. So we'll just quickly go through it. We already talked about health of
the consumer a little bit, but into '24 we're wondering if you think the consumer will
be facing more headwinds or less versus '23.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Can I say, about the same?
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Sure, that's the choice too.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Is that an option?
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I think I said it earlier, but it felt to me like because of inﬂation that things were going
to be tougher this year than they had been. And so I don't know exactly what's going
to happen 12 months from now, but it feels like because of employment wages,
some disinﬂation, that things kind of hang in where they are. And for Walmart, we
actually don't worry that much about whether the economy grows 3%, 2%, shrinks
1%, if people are more value-conscious, they come our way, even better to pay more
money, will drive more sales, so we have a bit of a hedge against that. And we're just
focused on executing our plan and don't worry too much about what happens
broadly with the consumer.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12

Kate McShane{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. And the part B of that question which you kind of just touched on too is the
potential impact from trade-up or trade-down in '24 versus what you saw in '23.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Again, I think it's probably about the same as we're seeing right now. The more
disinﬂation happens in categories like dry grocery and consumables, the more
discretionary income they have to buy general merchandise, so we may see mix
shifts, but the spend level kind of things into where it is I would expect the behavior
to be about what it is now. And I think holiday is going to be pretty good. So I don't
go into next year feeling too pessimistic.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. And share of wallet, we talked about maybe the trade-oﬀ between
consumables and discretionary, but do you have any views on the role of goods just
versus services, maybe in terms of prioritization of what you would expect to see in

They want all that, don't they? I mean, everybody wanted to take a vacation and get
out and travel and they have and they are, that probably continues, and on the good
side as pricing moves around, I think there'll be enough dollars to be able to get the
mix that we want to get.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay, great. Pricing too, we've kind of touched upon, thinking about pricing in 2024,
safe to say you think prices will be lower next year versus this year.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Slightly lower than a year ago, higher than two years ago, and our price gaps are in a
healthy place enabling us to grow and we're going to maintain those price gaps as
suppliers take their cost down, we'll try to quickly pass it onto customers and
members. But I think the suppliers are going to be able to do that. I think their cost
structure is changing. Many of them are wanting unit volume now and that's going to
help us drive demand.

Okay. And then the last question is on destocking. Obviously, there has been a
period here where...FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-12

That's a new word for me, relatively, recently like what does that mean, by the
(inaudible) inventory, yeah, that's how we should do.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
So there is in that period where you worked to some inventory down, where would
you say you are in that process? Are you more trying to be in a position to chase
going into holiday in next year? How should we think about that?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Right now we're in right spot. I think we're in good shape. The adjustment that we
needed to make when things change dramatically, honest, last year got made and
got made pretty quickly, so we are item and category at a time, thoughtful about the
level of aggression. So I was walking with merchants recently and we were going
through the holiday assortment and there are places where our buyers because of
their experience and the data they have they have a desire to go big and will buy an
item heavy and be aggressive and bullish. And there are other places where we're
just letting the replenishment model work and I think that's how it should be. So in
terms of our inventory, it's been coming down. We're in good shape, where our in-
stocks improved, and I think we're appropriately aggressive in the seasonal
categories.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. That's all the questions I have, so thank you so much.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Thanks for having me.
