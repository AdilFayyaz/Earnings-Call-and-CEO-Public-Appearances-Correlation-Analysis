Presentation
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Yes. Okay. Great. All right. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for sitting in. I'm Peter
Benedict, retail analyst at Baird. And I'm thrilled to introduce our next company,
Walmart. We're very fortunate to have with us Marc Lore, who's the CEO of the U.S.
e-commerce operations. As many of you probably know, Marc joined Walmart late
last year as part of the company's acquisition of Jet.com; prior to that was founder of
Quidsi, which was purchased by Amazon. So really, one of the foremost leaders in e-
commerce. And so we're really thrilled to have him here today. We also have Steve
Schmitt, equally distinguished IR professional, formerly of Yum Brands. I think Steve's
going to open with a couple of remarks. And then we'll just kick into a little Q&A.
And if we have time at the end, we'll open it up to questions from the audience.
{BIO 19791185 <GO>}
Thanks, Peter. Appreciate it. Thanks for coming and your interest in Walmart today.
Just a little bit of housekeeping before we kick it oﬀ with Marc. Today's presentations
may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks,
uncertainties and other factors identiﬁed in the safe harbor statement of our website
at stock.walmart.com and in our quarterly and annual SEC ﬁlings.
So after that excitement, Peter, back over to you.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
All right. Great. So -- well I guess we're going to start out. Doug McMillon, CEO of
the broader Walmart organization, has given you a lot of leeway, it seems, to whatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 2 of 11A - Marc E. Loreyou think needs to be done with the e-commerce business at Walmart in the United
States. So maybe talk about some of the key changes you've made since arriving late
last year. And as part of that, you've spoken about the customer value proposition in
that. Can you just help us understand how that is kind of guiding the way people
operate at Walmart e-commerce?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Sure, sure. So we just closed the Jet.com deal late September and spent really the
next few months really on restructuring the organization, getting the right people in
the right spots. So that we can move fast. Then really in the New Year, we focused on
2 main areas. One is getting the value proposition much improved. So that's the CVI,
the consumer value prop index, really focused on making sure we have the product
people want. They could ﬁnd it, display all the information they need, priced right
and delivered with a great experience. So really focused on the basic fundamentals.
Then another part was focused on innovation and leveraging Walmart's unique
assets to do some things that only Walmart can do. So on the fundamental front, we
ﬁrmed up pricing.
We launched 2-day free shipping with no membership, which has been very
successful. That was -- really contributed a lot to the growth that we saw in Q1, that
combined with also easy reorder. So people can shop at a Walmart store. And we've
got like 30 million shoppers' data in store that they can now see online in a really
easy-to-reorder list with no latency. They can quickly add things to their basket. I
think the combination of those 2 things really drove a lot of the growth. And was
core to the fundamental experience. With respect to innovation, in addition to
launching store #8, which is really focused on next-gen retail 5 and 10 years out, we
launched Pickup Discount, which basically gives consumers a discount when they
buy stuﬀ not in store. So that long tail at e-comm when they pick it up at a store.
So the most expensive cost of delivery is really last mile. And so we thought, "Well if
we can pull those supply chain shipping costs out of the system, we can share a lot
of those savings back with a customer, give them great prices while, at the same
time, driving them to the store." And we see that people coming to the store to do
their pickup are also going to the store and buying food. So we've got Pickup
Discount. And then we've just recently announced and we're testing associates to do
delivery. So we've got over 1.2 million associates in stores. And we thought, "Well
what if we -- we're sending packages to the store every day from the FC for pickup. If
we actually put the e-comm transactions on that same line, I'll leverage the Walmart's
trucking infrastructure." So associates are already located in the same location as the
packages. We could optimize and give the packages out to the associates based on
whatever route they decide they go in after work to minimize the distance of their
commute. And you can imagine, with hundreds of associates, there's a lot of routes
going in all direction. And so the actual distance to deliver the package is pretty
small.
So we're excited about the test we're doing. We still have a lot of work to do before
we're ready to roll it out. But then we also have the ability to leverage that not only to
do e-comm transactions. But also do same-day delivery from the store on both fresh,
frozen and GM. So excited about that. We've also done some M&A as well. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07

Page 3 of 11A - Peter Sloan Benedict
A - Marc E. Lore
A - Peter Sloan Benedict
A - Marc E. Lorethat's really on the fundamentals front. How do we enhance the long-tail fast? And so
we've picked up 3 retailers in ShoeBuy, Hayneedle and Moosejaw in their respective
categories, home, shoes and outdoor. We've got access to great merchants. We've
got access to relationships with thousands of brands, a couple of million SKUs with
really rich product content and data descriptions, pictures. And we gave the keys to
these CEOs to run these categories across Walmart and Jet. So it's really bolstered
the experience in those categories and will continue to. So that's a little bit of what
we're doing.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
That's great. Stepping over to the infrastructure. I think by the end of this year, our
estimate is that you guys will have spent probably north -- I mean, Walmart, north of
$10 million on e-commerce and technology CapEx over the last ﬁve years. So what's
your assessment of kind of Walmart's operating infrastructure right now? I mean, you
come here, what gaps are you seeing? What gets you excited? What needs to be
invested in over the next few years to kind of get you to the point to where you want
to get to?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. I'm excited about where the technology is. The technology platform, e-comm
platform was re-platformed a couple of years ago on Pangaea. The warehouse
network, we've got warehouses of the right size in the right location with automation.
This is a nice platform to build upon. I think a lot of the heavy lifting is going to be on
creating really specialized shopping experiences by micro category. We've got all
the details just perfected. And so we're going out and hiring category specialists
focused on very narrow categories and just trying to crush it. We recently just hired,
in fact, 5-time Olympic gold medalist swimmer, Nathan Adrian. And he's the
category specialist for competitive swim. Nobody knows competitive swim products
better than a competitive swimmer. And that's the idea, is that -- they're not all going
to be Olympians, by the way. But the idea is the same, is that we're hiring experts in a
very narrow ﬁeld to make sure we have all the assortments priced right,
merchandised right, all the stuﬀ.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
And are those learnings going to be applied at Walmart.com and also at specialized
sites? Like how do we see it? We've kind of termed it like a mass specialty strategy. It
kind of feels like there's the Walmart.com, there's Jet.com. And then there's going to
be these individual specialists. Is that the way we're going?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, the way I think about it is really there's 2 main sites in Jet and Walmart,
both mass sites going after diﬀerent audiences. But sharing the same back-end. So
we get leverage on the retail teams, on the logistics. But from a consumer
standpoint, we get access to more customers. We're sort of able to now push Jet
more premium, going after the higher-income urban customer, which is not the
typical Walmart.com shopper and Walmart.com with everyone else. The specialty
sites are really there, yes, to give us customers if they want another -- who want toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07

A - Marc E. Loreshop with a specialty experience. But more so taking the assets that have been
created by these special retailers and bringing them to Jet and Walmart. That's really
the purpose of it.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Makes sense, great. You touched on this a little bit earlier. But I want to expand on
the -- your assortment philosophy. I mean, I think you guys are worth $50 million
plus, at least as of the end of the First Quarter. You were less than, I think, $10 million
even two years ago. So a big growth there. I think Jet had $15 million maybe at the
time of the acquisition. Again, estimates. But where do those numbers need to go in
order for Walmart to compete the way you want? I mean, Colin Sebastian at Baird is
estimating I think Amazon's got $400-plus million. You have to go all the way there.
Talk about the ﬁrst million SKUs, the next $50 million, the next $100 million.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Okay. I think, I mean, the friction for third-party sellers to sell on multiple platforms is
not that much. So we're continuing to quickly add 3P sellers that are selling on other
platforms. And there'll be a point at which we get to parry. There's a ﬁnite number of
SKUs. So I'm less concerned about getting to parry on long-tail assortment. It's more
about getting the brands that really matter. It's really focused on -- and that's what
we're focused on really the top million SKUs. Top million SKUs, by our estimate,
represent around 2/3 of all sales done online. So it's really getting the right products
as opposed to quality over quantity.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
How does fresh ﬁt into that equation? I mean, everyone -- there's a lot of talk about
fresh as the next frontier. But talk to us --
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes, fresh -- yes. No. I think we're really well-positioned on fresh. I mean, we've got
over 700 stores now with same-day pickup of fresh, where we'll pick the product for
you and bring it out to the trunk of your car, where by the end of the year, we'll be
over 1,000 stores with fresh pickup. So we also have Net Promoter Score that's above
80. The customers absolutely love it. That's an oﬀ-the-charts NPS score. We'll
continue to roll it out to more stores. We've done the hard part in sort of building the
picking operation and being able to bring it out to the car. The next step is really
same-day delivery. We've got same-day delivery tests now in 10 stores and working
out, working really well. But I think this is one of Walmart's unique advantages, in that
we've got fresh and frozen food in over 4,000 points of distribution around the U.S.,
where the fresh food has gotten there in full truckload. So it's -- 90% of the countries
within 10 miles of fresh food, that's gotten in the most economically means possible.
So -- and in addition, we're also doing some really cool stuﬀ on Jet. We've got one
FC servicing half the U.S. population. And we're able to Ship to Home in refrigerated
boxes and coolers. And we're able to ship longer-tail products because we're
servicing half the country out of one facility. So I think combination of that, plus we
also announced that shareholders that we've trialed this almost shipping container.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07

A - Marc E. LoreIt's like a big vending machine, where we've got fresh and frozen in there. And you
can come up to it, scan your phone and literally get packages pulled right out of the
machine, which could be used to put in locations where we don't have stores. But I
think we have a good -- we've got a good game plan from fresh.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Greg Foran, who runs the U.S. stores business, CEO of U.S. stores, at the meeting last
week said he felt like he's moving from ﬁxing mode with the U.S. store business into
a leading mode. He feels like he can play a little more oﬀense, I guess, is the way to
say it. And obviously, the comp store sales have been great in the stores. And now e-
commerce is kind of coming in. And we all saw what happened in the last quarter.
Where do you see that relationship between the stores and e-commerce going here
over the next few years? I mean, talk a little bit more maybe about the last-mile
delivery. But I'm sure there's other exciting things you're working on again on which
you can talk about. But where do you see it? Because it feels like you've got 2
organizations that are kind of coming together at the same time, ready to kind of --
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
A big part of it. And the reason why we'd only move so fast, is the advice I got from
Doug and the board earlier on, was Greg is a key person to make and build a
relationship with to make sure that stores and e-comm are really like working
together. And so even before I started at Walmart, we already built a good
relationship. And we've been really close and making a lot of decisions jointly
together about the business. We've merged the marketing and technology groups
together across stores and e-comm. So there's only one marketing group. And
there's only one technology group. And they report in to me and Greg. So we have
one common brand. We have one common platform, one common SKU database
across. Like you've seen a lot of really good things happen. And it's just the building
blocks and the place for us to do some really interesting stuﬀ together.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
You've talked a little bit earlier about acquisitions. But I mean, what else is out there
that's from a capability standpoint? Or is a lot of what we should expect is you guys
kind of building things internally? I mean, I'm sure there's maybe other brand
capabilities, like you said, as you build the tail. But anything in terms of infrastructure
or whatnot --
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. We're really focused on organic growth. We've got store #8, where we're
incubating start-ups that are ring-fenced with the store organization. We're building
that from scratch. We'll be partnering with folks. But primarily organic. We're doing
acquisitions, like I said, in the small specialty players that can help accelerate entry
into the long-tail on Walmart. Then we've also experimented with a digital native
vertical brand in ModCloth, which gives us access to product and brand that you
can't ﬁnd anywhere else. So that helps to elevate the positioning of Walmart in Jet
and also comes with great margins and stuﬀ. So we're exploring a little bit with the
digital native vertical brands. But primarily organic. It's going to be organic.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07

Organic?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
And when you say -- you mentioned turnover rate. And I mean, you're probably
great -- as good a person as any to ask this question to. When we look out 5, 10
years, you've been a visionary in terms of the businesses you have created. What are
we not even talking about today that in 5 or 10 years that's going to be something
that everybody in this room needs to think about when investing, not just in Walmart
but in other parts of the market?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. Well I think in order to think about the future, you have to kind of look to the
past a little bit and make sure you're looking through the right lens. And so when I
think back to e-commerce. And I think, what was it -- what was the real step change?
If you ask the average person oﬀ the street, what is e-commerce? What was the step
change? I think most people go directly, "Oh, product delivered to your door. That's
the big step change." That's not really the step change because we were delivering
products to people's doors for decades through catalog. The real step change was
taking the physical catalog, that was expensive to ship, that had a limited number of
products, that was hard to sort of search and ﬁle through, hard to get content to
know what people thought, take that catalog and digitize it, expand it, add rich
content, pictures, descriptions, reviews, what other people thought, make it really
easy to ﬁnd stuﬀ in this catalog and make it really easy to buy stuﬀ in the catalog.
Hand it oﬀ to FedEx, hand it oﬀ to UPS, that's -- nothing's changed. Same things
happening now that it did 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago, right? So if you look through
that lens, you think, okay, really, the step change is about merchandise. So the
merchandising step change, which is really the core of retail. So if you look through
that lens and you think, okay, well, what's going to be the next step change in
merchandising? How do you have a richer experience? How do you buy stuﬀ more
easily? How do you get access to even more products than you have today? I think
that's sort of the lens. And if you look through that lens, there's really, I think, 2 big
areas. One is conversational commerce with the advances in artiﬁcial intelligence,
machine learning. It won't be long before you're able to have a much richer
experience and talk in a very conversational way, where you have the -- you're
talking to as much an expert in a particular product category like you would if you
walked into a specialty retailer and talked to the expert on the ﬂoor. I'll combine that
with having as much knowledge about what you like and don't like as your mom or
dad, like in combining the power of that and be able to do that in a very
conversational way, I think, takes the commerce experience to a whole another level.
Then I think that's a great building block toward virtual reality.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Marc E. LoreThen we're talking 10-years plus out. But where you're able to create a much more
immersive, richer, 3D experience, where you're able to see the products in their
native environment. So you want to go camping. And you literally can just say, "I'm
looking -- I'm going camping. I'm looking for a tent." Then there you are at a
campsite, in a place where -- the lines to the places you like to camp. And you're
able to walk the campsite and see the tents and ask about the diﬀerent tents and get
expert advice on it. You're able to see it and feel it and almost touch it. And do that
or be able to be buying produce and seeing an apple and being able to say, "Show
me where this apple was picked." And you're transported to the orchard. And there
you are able to see the farm and able to see the people that are doing the growing
and picking and ask them, "What's special about these apples?" "Oh, let me tell you.
It's organically farmed and all this stuﬀ." I think millennials will like and crave
information. They don't want to just buy products. They want to know where they're
made, what they're made of, that they have a soul and a mission for being. And I
think that comes to life through virtual reality. But the base is conversational
commerce. That's the building block for it.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
It's amazing we're having this conversation with Walmart, right?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
It really is.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
My last question. And then we'll turn it over to you guys to see if there's any out
there. Amazon's had a few announcements over the last month and change, the
shipping threshold. And then talking about going after giving a prime discount, I
guess, to folks who are on the SNAP program. So just your reaction to those and,
obviously, just one competitor out there.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes, no. I mean, we're oﬀering right now free 2-day shipping with no membership,
with a pretty reasonable $35 shipment. And we think we're really well-positioned
with that value prop. And we saw what it did in Q1. So we like where we're
positioned. And we'll continue to innovate.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Great. I guess, we can open it up here if there's any questions from the ﬁeld.
Yes. How do you guys at Walmart.com think the online part there [ph] really aﬀected
the delivery? [ph]

A - Peter Sloan BenedictHow do you get them to start there you mean? I mean, it's really just about getting
more customers to shop with you and have them come back more often and buy
more when they do. And that's what we saw in Q1. We saw a lot more new customers
come in. We saw existing customers shop more frequently and buy more. So at the
end of the day, it comes down to the value proposition that you oﬀer customers. And
we're laser-focused. I think we've got a really good team. And we've got a really
clear strategy on how to get the fundamentals better. And that's where we're
maniacally focused right now.
Price (inaudible)
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
It's all -- it's basically CVI. It's making sure we have the product, making sure they can
ﬁnd it, making sure we have all the rich content, priced right and delivered on time
and fast, like those are the chosen 5 bellwethers that we're focused on. And the
category specialists will really help to like iron out those ﬁner details on each
category to make it really an exceptional experience.
What categories (inaudible)
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
What categories are -- you said --
Which categories of (inaudible)
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, I don't think there's any one category. We're certainly focused a lot on
the head of the assortment in consumables and fresh. We think that's sort of the
foundation of the relationship with consumers. And we've got the smart cart
technology on Jet, where we're empowering customers to shop smarter by building
these bigger, more eﬃcient baskets to pull cost out of the system. So we've got a
good delivery experience, great assortment on consumables, got the ship speed
there. So that's a focus and, of course, the advantages with respect to fresh. But I'd
say that's probably a big area of focus. Then if I had to pick, I'd probably then go
long-tail in terms of apparel and shoes, accessories, jewelry, those sort of long-tail,
higher-margin categories, where we're looking at acquisitions and where we've
made a couple.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
One thing that came up last week, I think, on the side conversation, we were talking
about customer acquisition costs. Yes. The question was put to you like how do you
think about that? The reaction was kind of like, well, being at Walmart is nice. TalkFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Marc E. Lore
A - Peter Sloan Benedict
A - Marc E. Loreabout how the umbrella of being under Walmart has helped you in terms of from an
e-commerce perspective. That's kind of a bit of a game-changer in the sense of
brand awareness and customer awareness.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. That's good. I mean. So we're maniacal about like thinking about cash cost to
acquire a customer. And then tracking the cohorts and estimating the lifetime value
and tracking that really closely to make sure that we're getting the right return on
marketing spend. And knowing what the true marginal cost is of every marketing
dollar spent and the marginal return and looking in that by channels to ﬁgure out
where we should put our dollars. And one of the things that was fascinating and very
exciting about coming to Walmart was because of the massive brand awareness, the
return on a marketing dollar spend is that much greater just because people know it.
I think I probably didn't appreciate being at Jet how much harder it is to get
somebody to shop at a low CAC, or a low cost of acquisition, when they've never
heard of the brand. That's much easier to get people at Walmart. So that's been
really exciting. We've been able to put some dollars to work. And there's a lot of
room to do more of that, too.
How much value (inaudible)
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. So I mean, I feel like we've got a good base right now. We've got a good
logistics infrastructure and tech infrastructure. Obviously, as we grow and scale the
business, we're going to need to make more investments to support that additional
volume. But it's not a situation where we need to go back and rip everything out and
start from scratch. It's actually we've got a nice foundation to build upon.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
One other question I had was, I mean, you started to talk a little bit about the Pickup
Discount. But maybe talk about that last-mile conundrum or challenge, whatever
they call it. And how having these stores kind of evolve the economics there.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. So shipping from a centralized warehouse, very easy to get 2-day ground, not
that challenging to get overnight ground. We can do majority of the country
overnight ground from 6 diﬀerent locations. When you go to same-day, the
economics become very diﬀerent. You have to be within a pretty reasonable distance
to be able to deliver same-day eﬃciently. And it gets really expensive to do it. But
we're able, because of the scale of the Walmart physical brick-and-mortar, to have
product that we're moving in truckload quantities, total 4,000 points of distribution,
putting in 90% of the population within 10 miles of these 100,000 SKUs sort of
warehouses makes same-day delivery much more economical and viable, especially
fresh and frozen, which is impossible to do same-day from a central warehouse.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07

And is the Pickup Discount, is that just sharing the savings that you guys are
realizing?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. The Pickup Discount -- just to be clear, the Pickup Discount is on products, not in
store.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Right, that's not in the store. Right. That's what I was kind of thinking about.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. It's a long tail. And it's very simple math. It costs a small fraction to get it to the
store than it does to get it to somebody's home. And we basically say, "We have all
these savings. But share these savings with our customers to give them a better price
point. So that we sell more products to get better value and, at the same time, we're
driving traﬃc to the store." So --
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
That was very Walmart.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Well if there are any more questions, speak up. There we are. Another one more.
And then we go to breakout. Go ahead.
As it relates to one of your (inaudible) on Amazon's (inaudible) large portion of their
volumes, how do you then pass through their (inaudible)
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. So I don't really think about 3P and 1P necessarily in terms of proﬁtability. I think
you want to carry a wide or the widest possible assortment of products. It doesn't
make economic sense to carry a lot of those SKUs ﬁrst party because you don't have
the volume. There's obsolescence issues. There's holding costs and things. And so a
vast majority of SKUs, it's more economical to just get the commission and not bring
them in house. But when it is economical to bring it in-house, the margins are higher
than the commissions that you get from third-party merchants. So that's how we sort
of think about it. It's really a math exercise on thinking about when to bring them in
and when not to.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07
