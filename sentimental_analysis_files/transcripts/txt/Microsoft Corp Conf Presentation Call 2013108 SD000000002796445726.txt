Presentation
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Good afternoon. It is afternoon now. And my name is John DiFucci. Thanks for
coming to the JPMorgan Tech Forum at CES. I'm -- I cover software at JPMorgan.
We're very happy to have with us this afternoon Tami Reller. Tami's the Chief
Financial Oﬃcer, Chief Marketing Oﬃcer and runs the business of Windows for
Microsoft. So we're really happy to have Tami here with us today. We also have Todd
McCommon and Lisa Nelson from IR in the audience. I'm going to turn it over to
Tami, who's going to have some brief remarks. And then I'm going to move into
Q&A. Tami?
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Great. So thank you, John. And thank you JPMorgan for having us here. And thanks,
everyone, for attending both here and I know there's a webcast as well.
So before we get started, I do just want to brieﬂy read something that I think you've
probably heard before. So this presentation contains forward-looking statements,
which are any predictions, projections or other statements about future events.
These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are
subject to risks and perhaps some uncertainties. Actual results could materially diﬀer
because of factors discussed in our earnings press releases and the comments made
during the presentation, in the risk factors section of our Form 10K, Form 10Qs and
other reports and ﬁlings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any
forward-looking statements. Thank you.
All right. So with that out of the way, I did want to just take a few minutes, perhaps.
And then we'll jump into questions, John. And talk a little bit about Windows 8 and
give some broader context.
I mean, as we think about Windows 8 as a Company, it certainly is what we would
describe as a big, ambitious change and perhaps one of the biggest for Microsoft.
Certainly from a Windows perspective, it's the biggest change and the biggestFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-08

A - Tami Rellerendeavor, the biggest project since Windows 95. And it wasn't just a big, ambitious
change for us. It was something that we needed to and wanted to take the
ecosystem on that journey with us.
And as we think about that change, we really think back to how we described
Windows 8, which is Windows Reimagined. And when we talked about Windows
Reimagined, it was from the chipset to the user experience. But there's a lot in-
between that. We expanded chipsets. We gave -- we paved the way for new form
factors, a brand new developer platform. And with that, engagement with
developers; again, apps and the store. Then, of course, the user experience. So a
tremendous amount of change. And with that, we really did again bring the
ecosystem along with us.
I thought I'd take a moment and just give you an update on where we are with
progress with Windows 8. We -- during our Q1 earnings call we talked about the
Windows 8 ramp and we talked about that being roughly in line with Windows 7. We
then also talked about at the end of October, or the end of November, excuse me,
that we had reached the 40 million license mark, which was also roughly similar to
Windows 7 ramp.
And today I'd like to also announce that we have reached the 60 million license
mark with Windows 8. And again, roughly in line with where we would have been in
Windows 7. In fact, you may recall that back during our Q2 earnings, back in the
Windows 7 launch time period, we talked about 60 million. So we feel good about
what we have been able to accomplish with the ecosystem.
So much more; so much more opportunity ahead. But certainly, looking back, we're
pleased with what we were able to accomplish with the project and what we were
able to accomplish with the ecosystem heading into launch and in this ﬁrst selling
season. And clearly, with a project this ambitious, it's not just one selling season; it
will be the product of multiple selling seasons and more progress to come.
So John, questions you might have?
Questions And Answers
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Great. Tami, I guess the ﬁrst question, that data you just talked about, the 60 million
licenses sold, can you just speciﬁcally say exactly what that is? Because I've talked to
people and some people say, well, it means every since the launch. Some people
talk about other things. So if you could just clarify exactly what that means.
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Yes. And it is very straightforward and it's similar to -- it's identical, in fact, to how we
talked about Windows 7 licenses. So it's OEM. It's sell into OEMs for new PCs, as well
as upgrades. So it's upgrades and OEM licenses.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-08

Okay. Okay. Great. So you talked about change and there's been a lot of change; not
just in the product. But also in the team. Or just recently with Steven Sinofsky leaving.
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Sure.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Can you talk a little bit about that? You're the Chief Financial Oﬃcer, the Chief
Marketing Oﬃcer and then, when Steven left, you took over the business of
Windows and Julie Larson-Green is taking over the technology side.
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
That's right.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
So can you just talk about what's happened now that the dust has sort of settled? Are
there any other changes that that has, I guess, in eﬀect sort of occurred?
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Yes. No. I mean. And I'm glad you asked about that. I mean, the -- I think what's
important for this room and this audience to know is that the team focused on really
avoiding distractions and just getting set up to drive things forward, to drive the
business forward and to drive the Windows agenda forward.
I mean, there is an incredibly deep bench in Windows; not only at the senior
leadership level. But across the organization. And it's a team that is used to
delivering very, very big, complex projects together and in working across Microsoft
to bring teams together. And so, I think that's the real important thing to know, is that
the bench is incredibly deep and they know how to work together. They have proven
success in delivering projects together.
I mean, I feel very fortunate in having a great partner in Julie. And we know -- we've
been working together. We know how to work together, the whole team does. And
so, we are moving forward and did move forward fast after the change.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
So I guess since Steven left, you were there. Julie was there. I mean, has anything
below you changed as far as structure?
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
I mean, there's been some changes because we needed to get things aligned. Less
so in my world. A little bit more in engineering. But it's the same players.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-08

Okay.
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
It is the same players who know how to work together. And I would describe it as
largely a day of distraction and then people went back to the projects that they're
working on, which we won't talk about that today.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Okay. Going back to some of those numbers and what they mean and sort of
gauging the Windows 8 launch. And it sounds like at least the numbers are similar to
what happened with Windows 7.
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
And we all know that Windows 7 is a very successful product. But MPD has published
some data in late November that said -- and they actually said Windows 8 retail sales
were oﬀ to a slow start. I don't -- retail sales. I'm not sure how important that is. But I
guess what's your comment on that? And we've heard some -- I guess there's been
some other PC food chain executives at this event saying diﬀerent things. There's
been some confusion anyway. I think someone told me Michael Dell talked about
confusion among the consumers with Windows 8. So I guess what's your assessment
on the success of the launch of Windows 8 so far and where it's going?
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Sure. I mean, I think there's -- I mean, you all know this because you watch the
industry. But the PC industry and the device industry at large, I mean it's a very large
ecosystem and so there's always a lot of numbers and a lot of diﬀerent ways to slice
the data. We certainly have sort of all of our points of view on sort of how we look at
the market, how we look at how we're doing in the marketplace.
I think what's really interesting to look at is what we found customers asking for and
experiencing during these ﬁrst few months. And what we knew we would want to do.
And what we have done, is to just really watch those trends very, very carefully. What
our customer is asking. What's the awareness of Windows 8? What's the interest in
Windows 8? What's the purchase intent around Windows 8? What are they
experiencing at retail? What are they experiencing when they buy a PC and get it set
up? What are the usage levels? I mean, we wanted to make sure that we were sort of
very open to just watching exactly what was happening and evolving what we
needed to evolve.
And there's so many interesting things to talk about there. One of them is what --
where there was demand at retail. And I think we all had a strong sense that uniqueFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-08

Q - John DiFuccitouch devices, particularly touch laptops and tablets, convertibles, would be in high
demand. The level of demand I think surprised a lot of people. And frankly, the
supply was too short. I mean, there was more demand than there was supply in the
types of devices that our customers had the most demand for. And there was some
misalignment between where products were distributed and where there was
demand, etc. And so, there were some adjustments that were made real time. There
are some adjustments that are still happening.
And frankly, there's a lot of the tablets that are just coming to market now. I mean,
many of x86 tablets are just coming to market now. Some of the Windows RT tablets
did not get the type of distribution that perhaps would have been ideal. And so,
there's all of those dynamics which are really important to take into consideration.
The thing I would also say is on the usage side of Windows 8. It's been very
interesting and rewarding to watch the usage patterns of customers as they start to
use the product. I mean, it's pretty phenomenal when you look at sort of day one
usage of Windows -- with Windows 8 customers, is a number of the key features, let
me describe it as that, of the product get used within the ﬁrst 24 hours. Several of
the key functions are used -- over 90% of the time are used, whether that's search,
whether that's share, whether that's launching an app from the start screen. 84% of
customers go to the desktop on the very ﬁrst -- within the ﬁrst 24 hours.
You also, then, start to watch the pattern over the next several days and you just see
how much they start to -- continue to grow and use the product over time. And that
was always our belief, which is we wanted the product to be easy to start to learn
and then fun to just keep engaging with and learning more. And indeed, we're
seeing that and watching that closely.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Okay. So I mean, there have been mixed reviews out there on the product itself. But
as you said earlier, it really requires -- and it's something that you actually promoted
early on, the reimagining of the product. Even the use of the product --.
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
From the customer. So they really have to learn how to use it. So I guess there have
been some reviews that have been sort of negative out there but, at the same time,
anything that's really very diﬀerent takes time.
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
It does.

Q - John DiFucciSo I guess, in your view at this point, I mean, I'm sure you had a diﬀerent gauge on or
a band of how you hoped this would progress. Where you are right now, I guess are
you within that band and where are you within that band? Are you in the middle of
the band? Are you somewhere a little better or a little worse than you had hoped
you'd been right now and how do you expect this to progress from here?
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Right. I mean, there's certainly no shortage of conversation about Windows 8. That's
one thing I was -- I would summarize it that way, which is there's a lot of conversation
about the product. And I think the -- what's been important to us is to really watch
how customers have the opportunity to explore the product.
I mean, the other thing that we're ﬁnding, which is probably not surprising but just
worth articulating, is that it's important for customers to get their hands on the
product and that's indeed what we're seeing at retail, which is they want time with
the product.
We also know -- at launch we talked about -- you might recall we talked about 1,000
systems. 1,000 unique systems had been certiﬁed for Windows 8. One thing that's
diﬀerent from the Windows 7 launch is that, post-launch, we're now up to more than
1,700 systems. So I mean, that's an incredible amount of sort of new systems that are
coming in, which also means customers have a lot of choice. And so, they are
essentially evaluating a new OS and they are then having the opportunity to look at
quite a diverse set of hardware options.
And so, again, that takes some time for customers to digest and make and make
choices. And so, we work at getting better and better at helping customers with that
journey and making sure that, whether it's our retail partners or whether it's our OEM
partners, how do we help them help customers on that journey. And some of it just
takes time. I mean, you imagine, just as time progresses you then have a family
member or a coworker who then has the system who can describe some things to
you, etc. And so that, of course -- that, of course, will help start the ﬂywheel further.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
So the quantity of systems out there that have been certiﬁed for Windows sounds
really high based on historical --.
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
And it is.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Trends or historical data. But how satisﬁed are you with the -- I guess quality of -- I
mean, do they -- do the products today really exhibit the ability to really put
Windows 8 forward in the kind of way that you want it to and/or what should we
expect from the next, like, wave of new products coming out?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-08

A - Tami Reller{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, we said this at launch. And in fact, I think Mike and Julie said it during
the launch event, which is with Windows 8 we have the best PCs that have ever been
built and that's true. We have the best PCs in market that have ever been built. And
with these new certiﬁcations, more and more to come.
We, I think collectively as an ecosystem and as an industry, want more and more
touch assortment. Like, if we say sort of what do we want more of and what does the
market want more of from us of, it's more touch assortment. And that's certainly
tablets. That's certainly convertibles, touch laptops, touch laptops at great prices, all-
in-ones, all-in-ones at great prices. I mean, all of those are proving to be high
demand items. And so, that's still a partial to-do for the industry, is to just continue to
deliver on all of that. But again, even in this month, during this show, you've seen a
lot of new devices in the touch category come to market; or at least announced to
come soon.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Okay. Great. So sticking with the hardware, last month you announced -- I'm going to
move to Surface a little bit.
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
You announced that you're increasing production of Surface on ARM and expanding
distribution to third party --.
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Retail stores. It's really early. But can you comment on that? Are you seeing any
success or early success there?
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, Surface has been such an exciting product for us to be able to announce
and announce as part of really our Windows 8 journey. And we made a very explicit
decision initially to launch this ﬁrst-time product into our own stores so that we could
have the opportunity to really watch and watch carefully and learn and just get things
right. And so, that was terriﬁc to be able to do that and it was very rewarding just to
be able to see customer reaction directly.
We always had it in our plan to then start conversations with retailers about bringing
Surface into broader distribution. What we found when we started to have thoseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-08

A - Tami Rellerconversations is they did want to do what retailers don't often do. And that is to get a
product into -- onto shelves very, very quickly. And in some cases, it was a matter of
days. And so, we did have the opportunity then to see Surface in a few retailers for a
few days of the holiday, which was great. And so, I know -- that was helpful to us as
we now prepare for the selling seasons to come. So we were pleased and I think it's
safe to say that we're pleased.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Just sticking with Surface for a second, now we have Surface Pro
coming out
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
We do.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Which -- I mean, from my perspective anyway, it's coming from the strength of
Microsoft, which is the PC. And that's really -- it's going to be more PC-like than the
RT version. But I guess what are your expectations relative to your experience with
the -- with RT?
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, we're very excited about Surface Pro, which will start to hit the market in
the weeks ahead and we'll talk more about that in the near term. And you described
it well, which is it's a PC that also does an incredible job as a tablet. I mean, it's a
Core i5. So the performance is terriﬁc and yet it has so many of the great attributes
of Surface, including touch cover, type cover, the kick stand, all of the great hardware
design that we've talked about with Surface. So we're excited to be able to oﬀer
customers, both consumers and business customers, two choices.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Okay. Great. And I'm going to ask one more question on Windows 8 and then I'm
going to go to something that's near and dear to my heart, anyway. I guess can you
tell us anything about Windows 8 adoption among corporations?
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Right. So -- exactly. And we've talked a little bit about this. But I think it's worth
recapping and then I can give an update on Windows 7 deployment, which I think is
important, too, in this context.
I mean, from the start we have talked about our expectation that Windows 7 in a
corporation would live alongside Windows 8 devices in a ﬁne fashion and that's
exactly how we built the product. And we believed. And we're seeing that come true,
that Windows 8 adoption would predominantly happen for two reasons. One is
Windows 8 apps would be interesting to a corporation and they'd be building on
the developer platform and therefore bring Windows 8 devices into either scenariosFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-08

Q - John DiFucci
A - Tami Reller
Q - John DiFuccior lines of business or work groups that were going to use a new app. And we're
seeing a lot of interest in that.
Then the second. And perhaps even more obvious, is when new Windows 8 devices
are brought in; speciﬁcally tablets. And I think as we think about some of the x86
tablets that are starting to come to market now, indeed, we're seeing that interest
level pick up. And there's been some very visible stories, whether it's Emirates, who's
done some great work on one of HP's tablets and Windows 8 and Windows 8 apps. I
mean, a really, really great app for their ﬂight crew. We've seen the Department of
Defense, which made a very big bet, visible bet on Windows 8 last week. And so
some great early success with Windows 8.
And yet, Windows 7 deployment remains really the big activity still in enterprises.
And in fact, we're now well past the 60% mark with deployment. And how we
measure that, because I sometimes get that question, is we measure all of the
desktops -- we look at all the desktops across or all the PCs across our commercial
customers and then measure the percentage of deployment on those PCs. So that's
what I'm talking about when I say 60%, because we have well over 90% of
enterprises that are on their Windows 7 journey. But when you look at the actual
desktops, it now well over 60%. So great progress.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Okay. And when you deﬁne the enterprise or the corporate customers, I've heard
mixed things throughout the years.
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
We use diﬀerent words, you mean.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Yes. Or diﬀerent people use diﬀerent words, too, at Microsoft.
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
So when I think of the enterprise, I think there's the consumer and then I think of the
enterprise and the enterprise has the enterprise, the midmarket and the small
business. And even in the small business, some of those small businesses really act
like consumers --.

That's right.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
When you're talking enterprise are you including the small business in there?
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
So I tend to say enterprise to mean our top 2,000 customers.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Then commercial or business to mean broader across the business segment much
more broadly.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
And we also know that small businesses, even midmarket businesses are going to
sometimes do as consumers do and they will be interested in those types of devices,
which I think is -- speaks well to what Windows 8 does well, which is it does work and
it does play and it brings it all together and let's you -- whatever device you're on,
you can do what you need to do for work and do what you need to do for the other
parts of your life.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. Great. Then, you talked about Windows 8 operating alongside Windows
7. And I've heard people talk about that, too. And at JPMorgan we use Windows --
well, I'm on Windows 7 now. But I think we're -- not everybody is quite there yet. But I
think most people are.
But people are using tablets to -- that are not Windows based to connect into our
systems and use it. Is there an advantage with Windows 8 tablets as far as integration
into the systems of JPMorgan or anyplace else beyond let's say the iPad or
something else like that?
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, we're working hard to make sure that is the case. And whether it's a
Windows RT Tablet and the capabilities that we have to bring that into your
corporate environment and be able to do what you need to do, yet not have all of
the IT taxed upon that. Or an x86 tablet, which is going to act just like a PC.
And what we feel so strongly about is that whether it's IT that's making a decision on
behalf of the end user, or whether it's the end user who we believe should be able
to have choice, we want to be able to sort of bridge that divide and give the end
user exactly what they'd like in a device and an experience. And yet be able to oﬀer
IT the types of things that they're trying to achieve. And we often talk about that as
sort of best of both worlds.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Okay. Okay. Great. And one thing that I just thought of that I've heard people say
from Microsoft is talking about piracy. Now, piracy we all know is rampant and
especially is rampant in emerging markets. But I've heard --.
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Some more than others. Some emerging markets more than others.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Yes. And -- but, is there something with Windows RT especially, or even tablets, that
will -- do you believe could reduce the piracy?
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
I mean, sure. There deﬁnitely is some unique elements of Windows RT which
changed the piracy dynamic. We deﬁnitely think that the value of Windows RT is in --
mostly in other areas other than that business objective. And so, we can -- and I say
that because we continue to work on a number of programs with our partners, both
our OEM partners, as well as the retail partners, to make sure that we get genuine
into the hands of more customers and that's the primary objective.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-08

Q - John DiFucciWe often -- it often gets talked about as piracy. We tend to talk about it as we want to
make sure we get genuine Windows into the hands of more customers, because
oftentimes customers don't even know the explicit choice that they're making or not
making. And so, we want to make sure that we do everything we can to get genuine
Windows on as many devices as possible and, in particular, certain emerging
markets, China most especially. And to give customers that much better experience;
more secure. I could go on and on. But there's just so many beneﬁts of being
genuine. And frankly, working with our OEM partners is one of the most important
things that we can do. And we've made some progress with Windows 8. More
progress to make.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Is -- but is there a certiﬁcation process or something that -- technology driven that
would make it more diﬃcult to pirate RT?
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
I mean, that is true. That is true. And so, we'll see how that works out.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Yes. We'll see how it works out. I mean, even -- they may not know half the time. But I
was actually in China when Windows 7 was coming out and you could buy Windows
7 for $1.12 at a store. But anyway, that's another story.

I think -- the thing I would say here is it's really important for us to do well with
Surface. We are very, very focused on that. And we often get asked this question,
which I think is important for me just to talk about for a minute. And we did talk
about it when we ﬁrst talked about Surface. We talked about it again when we
launched Surface, which is Surface we really believed would help us be smarter and
better about this -- breaking down any seams that might exist between the OS and
hardware and certainly make us just wiser overall on devices.
But it's a business. We got into this business as a business. This isn't a short-term
adventure and it's not something we take anything but very seriously. And we're very
pleased with what we've accomplished so far for Surface. But there's much more
opportunity ahead. And so, we're focused on these two great devices in Surface RT
and Surface Pro and sort of what that brings for us and that's our focus.
