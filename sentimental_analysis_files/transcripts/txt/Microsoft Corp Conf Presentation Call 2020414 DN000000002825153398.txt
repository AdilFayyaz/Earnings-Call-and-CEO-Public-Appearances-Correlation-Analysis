Good morning, and welcome to the Bloomberg Intelligence webinar on the outlook
for collaboration software makers amid COVID-19. My name is Mandeep Singh,
Senior Analyst, covering software and TV for the tech team here. Just want to start oﬀ
by saying our thoughts go out to the people who have been aﬀected by this
challenging situation and we hope it's over soon.
Couple of housekeeping items. Our webinar will be recorded and a replay will be
available later. Views expressed by the analysts are their own and I encourage
everybody to send their questions in real time, which we'll take at the end.
Our guest speaker today is Wayne Kurtzman, who is the Research Director, Social
and Collaboration at IDC. With that, I'll pass it on to Wayne, who will start oﬀ with the
presentation and then will assist to a Q&A format. Wayne?
Thank you very much. Mandeep. I hope everyone is well or get well soon, also
looking forward to moving on from this. But we are here and in the words of Doug
Adams, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy author, he penned and said "We are stuck
with technology when what we really want is just stuﬀ that works." This becomes
important because about 10 years ago, as smartphone adoption started growing,
every individual when they needed to learn something in real-time can search it. If
they needed to communicate with someone, they downloaded an app. If they
needed to collaborate with someone, they downloaded an app. And then, they
started wondering why they could collaborate easier outside of work, communicate
easier outside of work with their family, friends community organizations than they
could at work. And in fact, 55% of all collaborative applications in an enterprise start
as unsanctioned apps because they want stuﬀ that works.
And often, that's what we hear around some of the key technologies that have been
adopted over the last 10 years. It just works. This also changes who a knowledge
worker is. Anyone that's connected, if they're recognized by the business is that
potential knowledge worker and that creates a huge opportunity for enterprises thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-14

Page 2 of 14they're realizing now and whether they wanted to digitally transform this quickly or
not, it's what's happening.
And collaboration is a key area. It is one of the areas that are the huge beneﬁciary. It
feels oﬀ to say beneﬁciary at a time like this, but these companies are doing well. The
beneﬁts and this research by the way is earlier this year of 253 collaboration leaders
and enterprise. This is before COVID-19 really came into play, and we ask what are
your top ﬁve beneﬁts of using a team collaboration application and up top real-time
information? This was much lower last year. So it's interesting to see, but it was tied
into increased personal productivity and saving time and group productivity, but
also scoring low last year and all of a sudden came up high is feel more informed
and connected and better relationships with others. The ﬁeld [ph] is more and
remember this is prior to COVID-19 and we really want to feel connected now. But
even prior to this, this was one of the key takeaways.
And when you start seeing ﬁelds and better, it under -- better relationships, it
underscores that collaboration is not just technology, but it's culturally based, and
that does create some challenges.
First core is right in the middle; security, governance and compliance. That's what
we're doing to mitigate risk with a collaborative stacking culture. But as we look
around, these are the areas that most companies have to deal with. Starting in the
upper right, the communications layer, messaging, especially short-form messaging,
conferencing and team collaboration applications. This is what people use outside of
work. They're used to face-to-face video conferencing. They're used to messaging,
but the team collab applications they need stuﬀ together, then on the content layer
oﬃce suites and ﬁle sharing.
What I want to point out is, on that comps layer and content layer, if you do not
provide, if an enterprise does not provide of good version of this, most consumers,
most people know where to get a good one. It's easy to use G Suite Docs to
collaborate. It's easy to get a premium version of Slack that's robust. All type of
messaging apps that are out there as well. You need to empower people to do
people things and that sometimes is a little hard for some enterprises to grasp and
others have really, really taken it in.
But then comes the secret sauce, that's the productivity layer where the integration
of systems of record like CRM, HRIS. When you integrated into collaborative
application, you're removing friction and barriers from getting work done. You're
allowing data to share easier and that again comes back to security governance
compliance. But beyond that, the next part is cultural. On the left upper side, we all
want a safe place to work.
We're all trying to navigate our families in the house or just ourselves then the house.
Either way, this is new. But we want a safe place when we go to work. A place where
the ideas are engaging and it's a place for ideas to mature. The mentoring and
modeling, this is another super power that really helps companies, not only doFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 14better than what you saw in the previous slide as far as results, but really start
connecting dollars and time into new results and transforming. When you empower
your peers to mentor other and model behavior, then all of a sudden, it's much
better than a boss thing, "Don't do it".
A peer does it and then the peer can also collect data and share back to the
organizer of the collaborative platform to develop new features. This is what we
need. So now the enterprise is growing collaboration assets in real-time and abilities
in real-time and again that cross silo [ph] membership that becomes very important.
If you just threw Slack or Microsoft Teams or at last any other solution into an
enterprise, they're going to naturally form around the people they need that add
value to that group. That's what we're talking about when we talk about encouraging
subject matter experts from across the spectrum.
If we look at the market forecast that we had, please remember I did this in July that
we published this in July 2019. This is the 2018 year. So 2018, the collaboration, the
collaborated markets were $14.8 billion. This consists of team collaboration
applications that would be like Slack, Microsoft Teams, some of the Atlassian
products, some of the work ﬂow products like Smartsheet, like an Asana.
Conferencing such as Zoom, Microsoft Meetings, Google Meetings. E-mail and
enterprise social networks, enterprise communities, so Khoros community,
Salesforce community, cloud and that.
If we look at each one of these, we were predicting a $26.6 billion market in 2023. I
did not have a pandemic in my forecast. I'm very sorry about that, but if we look at it
right now and we're still developing the numbers, still looking at more data points,
we were looking at a 12.4 CAGR over ﬁve years period ending 2023 and that was
being held down by e-mail.
Right now, if I take a look at team collaboration applications, which we were looking
to grow at 20.3% CAGR, winners, there are a lot of winners that are going to -- that
are coming from this. Actually, the team collaboration applications market probably
jumped two years, maybe a little more in just the ﬁrst quarter and retention will
probably be very, very strong because enterprises are rolling it out ﬁrst and then
building it out and I think that's what you're going to continue to see.
Microsoft is seeing some more adoption from their base. Slack is seeing tremendous
growth, Atlassian growth. There is a lot in the market that is growing. Conferencing
will be much bigger than 13.6% CAGR. Conferencing still trying to narrow down
those numbers, but it wouldn't surprise me to see a CAGR with a very strong 2020
and a very strong retention rate, some of the consumers may fall oﬀ a little bit, but
we are actually just looking at business revenue here, we're looking at enterprise
revenue. We're not looking at the B2C revenue.
So still we're looking at a very healthy probably upper 20% CAGR growth over ﬁve
years when this gets redone. Everything is indicating toward that, but I do want to
see some more data points come in. Conferencing and team collaborationFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-14

Page 4 of 14Q - Mandeep Singh
A - Wayne Kurtzmanapplications won't go away because this is part of transformation. And if the
transformation is already in place and you're seeing beneﬁts, you can't pull that out,
you can make it better, but can't pull it out.
E-mail, 4.3% CAGR that's going to show up closer to 10% and it's going to grow a
little bit more as new features and integrations come in and enterprise social
networks or enterprise communities, those are going to grow as well. We had them
at 13.4% ﬁve-year CAGR, that's going to be a little higher because companies are
starting to realize they have to be more social, they have to build trust and build trust
at scale. And if they provide a well-moderated community, they will attract partners
and customers within that, and it doesn't make a diﬀerence if you're B2B or B2C
because if they don't provide that well-moderated community, people will go, and
they are going to LinkedIn and Reddit. So you're going to see some stronger growth
there that I think will lag behind just a little bit.
This is an oﬀshoot of social media as well. If a company is responsive in social media
and as well staﬀ, they're going to do much better because in many cases, social
media is also seeing some growth. It's not reﬂected in this chart, but people stuck at
home, multitasking. They going to try getting through to whichever company it is on
social channels if it will save them some time. And that's an interesting development.
So again, those numbers growth with the comps layer, the content, productivity layer
and the culture building altogether.
That's just a quick overview of what I see. It's a good time to be interested in
collaboration. You won't probably build out your personal collaborative stack as well.

Questions And Answers
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Great. Thank you, Wayne. That was a perfect way to kick things oﬀ. So one of the
things that I get from a lot of investors and folks that I talk to is look, conferencing or
ﬁle sharing, these are features at the end of the day. So and there are lot of
companies that are really doing this on a standalone basis. Zoom is a great example.
On the conferencing side, Slack on the collaboration side, Atlassian on the DevOps
side, and we have smaller players like Smartsheet, Box, Dropbox. How do you view
this market? Long-term, is this just going to be a standalone product that makes
these multi-billion dollar companies or you think they're going to be integrated into
something? Just wanted to get a sense if you had a long-term view on these
companies.
Absolutely. And let's take a step back and look at the market itself. The collaboration
market is very much entering its teenage years. And if we know anything about
teenage years, they're totally unpredictable. What could go wrong? But what is alsoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 14Q - Mandeep Singh
A - Wayne Kurtzmanhappening is the longer game is starting to develop. Microsoft and Google are
starting to talk about knowledge management. The ability to codify and reuse
management and raise it to the people who need it, when they need it and it comes
from so many diﬀerent places.
As we also look forward toward 5G and more data being pushed to the edge,
computing power and abilities to collaborate will be augmented greatly. Every one
of the top players in the market are looking at that long game. Yes, collaboration is
still human, but the augmentation to do more better in unique ways, develop things
diﬀerently are really part of a larger knowledge management game and I think
everyone's a little nervous to see how the business consumers and the consumers in
general will be buying at -- as the COVID-19 epidemic starts, moving on to the next
phases.
What's going to happen? One of the things that probably will not happen, in my
mind, is that people will stop using collaboration. People, this will not happen.
People will stop communicating in the way they're doing it. This will not happen. The
reason is, it's now the way they communicate. It's like kind of rip out the phone from
-- in 1990. It's not going to happen.
The way people have communicated has fundamentally changed and businesses
can now leverage that and every piece of data as a Zoom call transcript. a Teams
transcript, wherever it comes from because transcription and AI and ML will be very
normal, all become assets that can be reused as part of knowledge management
and that's the longer game. The diﬀerence, the two games that may be played in the
long run is it a best-of-suite solution, Microsoft, Google, or a best-of-breed solution
where you're literally integrating to get the custom stack you need and the early
answer is, it's going to be both and there is plenty of market.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
I guess coming back to what would large enterprises go with? At the end of the day,
they don't want to deal with hundreds of vendors, they don't want to use point
product that holds security with, and granted the integration is the value proposition
around integration, the best-of-breed products is quite compelling. But at the end of
the day, when Microsoft is oﬀering Teams at a fraction of the price that Slack is
charging, then I guess enterprises would want to move to that bundle level and
solution where they are getting that security posture and dealing with just one
vendor as opposed to multiple vendors. So I wanted to see if you had a view on
anything like this that you have seen in the past or if this is so nuance that the large
players can do it that well that Zoom and Slack are doing anything along those lines?
I think that honestly there is a good comfort factor in working with Microsoft. But also
there is -- what -- your needs may not come as soon as you need them. And that's
true, that's not just a Microsoft thing, that's true with any large enterprise that has a
suite of products. And I think the longer version, you have to watch out, and IT
managers have contacted me and saying, is they are ﬁne print? Does it stay free for
six months, then this or is it just lower price? So there are a lot of dynamics and a lotFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 14Q - Mandeep Singh
A - Wayne Kurtzmanof IT managers are looking at that ﬁne print and don't want to get sucked into a
limited time only that's where some vendors that have a really generous freemium
version are beneﬁting, and in fact many of those premium versions are being turned
into paid versions, whether it is at the line of business or at the enterprise.
And one of the things that I keep on saying for years is that, a lot of the collaboration
and communications products enter at the line of business because it's better than
the enterprise. It's easier -- it just works. To go back to that ﬁrst slide, people want
things that just work and they need to look good from working at home, they need
to be able to produce and that's something that now you have that balance.
Can I get something that just works? And it may mean opening up new ways of
purchasing that are in fact not the way we've had it before. A good example, data I
have from 2019 show that 57% of businesses surveyed went with who they have a
contract with, that number is almost 50% this year, because they are ﬁnding out who
they had a contract with did not always meet their needs. So it will be the evolving
needs of the enterprise that drive this and it could mean a little bit of ﬂexibility over
time and multiple winners in this market.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Got it. And just a reminder for everyone, if you have a question for Wayne, you can
type your question in the webinar window and submit it and we'll be sure to take it
out towards the end of the webinar.
So going back to just the overall market opportunity, and one thing, I mean I know
you think the CAGRs that you had on the slide are probably too conservative at this
point given the demand surge we have seen for these tools. But do you think this is
going to fade oﬀ once the situation normalizes and we are going to go back to low
to mid-teens growth? Or is there some market share shift going on when it comes to
the traditional vendors that were in this space be it Cisco Webex, LogMeIn, and there
are a few other go to meet -- Citrix GoToMeeting that people they'll end up
replacing those on premise tools or the traditional on premise tools with some of the
newer tools like Zoom, like Slack, and there will be some acceleration in market
share shifts here as a result of this whole virus situation?
Every vendor I've talked to, they've wanted to move customers into the cloud. Even
those that have a heavy presence on-prem, many of them are very happy to do a
hybrid solution, but ultimately this will accelerate. And conferencing has been most
successful in the movement to the cloud, partially because of Zoom success being
fully in the cloud. But you're also seeing vendors like RingCentral and 8x8 that are
very successful in that LogMeIn is doing very well. There are a lot of companies who
are needless to say, Microsoft and Google, too, have to be included, but pretty much
everyone is doing this and every vendor has always wanted to move to the cloud,
because -- and this is a one thing I hear time and time again, is there a lot of vendors
with on-prem solutions that don't want to upgrade because things are working. And
unfortunately that creates issues that are rooted in user experience and often
security and they need to be.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 14Q - Mandeep Singh
A - Wayne KurtzmanSo the cloud solution really enables the customer to get the best user experience
they can, so I do believe that with the exception of certain security, high security
issues, you're going to see continued acceleration to the cloud. I'm quite sure I will
have that late period CAGR ﬂoating around 90%, but I have to caution that in this
market that we're looking at right now, this excludes telephony vendors where you
have to buy telephony to get the software.
So some of AT&T, for example, is not in here. Traditional PBX that might have a cloud
oﬀering, but you have to buy. That is not in this forecast. That's why the -- that's why
the cloud percentage is so high. This is the software market and this is where we're
seeing jumping from traditional into the cloud, and a lot of vendors have made that
jump. And they're starting to scale and a lot of them are basing it on some open
source, which is very good. There is a lot of places where they can develop some
really outstanding solutions and it's almost all video.
The WebRTC standard made it very easy for people to -- for companies to deliver
high-quality solutions that they can wrap in their own way and that turns out to be a
very big deal right now.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Got it. And you mentioned open source and freemium and for a lot of the CIOs, they
are still reluctant or at least they were reluctant before this whole virus situation to
deploy freemium or open source products. Do you think security will remain a big
concern when it comes to the single point products deployed on cloud that may not
have that secure framework that Google Suite or Microsoft Suite oﬀers?
Security will always be top and foremost number one. You have to protect. You have
to protect. And that's why, IT -- and I've noticed a shift the last ﬁve years is that, CIOs
and those who report to the CIOs have gone from "you shall do it this way to what
do you bring in, why did you bring it in, what problem does it solve" And they're
learning from people who probably got ﬁred seven years ago for bringing in what
they did into now working with the CIOs to teach them, while the CIOs then add
their knowledge of security governance and compliance necessary and they're
realizing that some of these newer products and this includes the Zooms, Slacks,
Atlassians of the world, sometimes even the Cisco Webex and LogMeIn's all of these
coming in really solve a larger business problem.
And most successful collaboration we see is, not only bottom up, but top down
support. Nothing -- there was a piece of research I did and 90% saw amazing,
amazing results. Some as much as 40, 50 hours additional a week retain, more than a
full work week and then there are some people who saw 70-hour, 60-hour work
weeks negative. And these people after some more research we found we're
copying and pasting content from email to the collaboration solution because one
or two people wouldn't move over to the collab solution.
So actually Slack and Microsoft when they integrate solve that problem, in a Slack
Microsoft integration in a rather clever way, Google had it built in from day one, soFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 14Q - Mandeep Singh
A - Wayne Kurtzmanthey really never had to face that problem with their integrations. But they're getting
around that, so that over 10% who have to copy and paste between systems have a
life, that's going to be a feature rolling out in Teams started to rollout as well where
can also feed into outlook a little better.
So we're solving those problems one at a time. But the biggest problem and it also is
a main issue in security, our people. Given the stuﬀ that just works that meets the
security requirements and people are going to be happy and much more
productive. If you remove those barriers, they're going to be more productive.
And right now that's people need to feel that and they need to also -- and CIOs are
also adapting to having non-business conversations because, and for many of us, the
ﬁrst ﬁve minutes of a call, 10 minutes of a call are how are you doing, how are you
coping with this, what it's like by you? We have never been more people like in
business than we are right now and that's something that's probably going to
continue.
We're letting each other into our homes. So that's both connecting us deeper to our
co-workers, to our clients, to our prospects in ways that we never were before, but
also security is having to look a little bit diﬀerently at this and say, this is the new
normal, and I think that's also going to play into the larger trust discussion about
what's done with the data that businesses will have to face up to in the near future
and a lot of them have already started that discussion.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Is there any way to quantify the feature, a gap between Slack and Microsoft Teams or
Zoom and Google Hangouts like how should people who are looking at this market
holistically get a sense of how far ahead is Slack from Teams and how far ahead is
Zoom from Google Hangouts?
I just consider, let's handle each one separately. Number one: Microsoft Teams and
Slack, they do diﬀerent things. Microsoft keeps documents together nicely, but
they're not the best place to hold the conversation, where Slack basically takes
conversations that would be an email and put it in channels and it integrates with
Oﬃce or G Suite, they keep the documents in the conversations together.
They are diﬀerent. They, I think, are better together because you can leverage more
things together and ultimately, you'll be able to leverage, diﬀerent types of ML and
AI. Basically Slack's goal was to make any software that's attached to it work better
and in fact it does remove layers of friction. So it does keep things together for the
record, and Microsoft Teams, again brings science [ph] together in diﬀerent ways.
Now if -- but is not the best chat tool yet. I don't know if they want to get there, but
there is -- they're both really good at what they do and they are both getting
tremendously better, but I do believe they're better together.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 14Q - Mandeep Singh
A - Wayne KurtzmanIf you take the Zoom and Google Hangouts meeting solutions, they are diﬀerent as
well. Personally, I do miss some of the augmented reality, a little crowns and other
things that Google used to do that if they didn't put in the business thing, but we
need that in the business tools now. We need those background that Zoom enables
us. We need some things that are easy to use. Zoom added that security feature,
changed the default, they reacted very quickly to a lot of this, and I think a lot of the
negative hype is hype, a lot of the problems were user issues that they now have to
take steps to ﬁx.
For Google, they have the integration into the G Suite. But to be honest, Zoom won't
integrate to either. It's really -- that's a closer game. If you really want to look at the
diﬀerent beneﬁts that are available on the platform, where is the AI, the ML, open
ML, for example, within Google Suite, G Suite allows you to do certain things that
may be incredibly valuable as you start moving toward that goal of knowledge
management and retaining every conversation in a way that it becomes data that is
actually usable later.
One of the big problems we had in the '80s is, we had a ton of data, in the '90s
more data, we don't know what to do with it. We have -- when we started looking at
web logs and all the sudden, we got some insight on how things were being used
now worked at the point of being able on the verge of doing that with AI and
training ML to do it to really beef up the depth of knowledge we have around not
only our individual work, but the collective body of work that we've done as teams.
So again, Slack and Microsoft Teams are diﬀerent. I think they're better together.
Zoom and G Suite Hangouts meetings, they're closer, but they do have
diﬀerentiations that may appeal to an enterprise more than -- one more than
another.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
So is there any sector or you know, I can think of maybe BPO or any other market
that inadvertently gets impacted because the conferences -- conferencing
capabilities are so good now because collaboration tools can do what they weren't
able to do before. Do you think there is a market that gets disrupted as a result of
these tools being so eﬀective at collaboration and communication?
Absolutely. If you allow better collaboration and communication, ﬁrst of all, the
systems of record that slide from earlier on the productivity layer. It becomes a chain
as like we have these conversations, where can they help? Well let's integrate the
systems of record. Workﬂow and ﬂow of work, work management becomes one of
those that if you're process-oriented then that becomes the easy one to put in.
There were other ways marketing can deﬁnitely use products like that. And anything
with a good kanban board and a ﬂow and APIs to AI and ML become very, very easy
to add. If you're in manufacturing, you may actually decide that some of the
equipment you have needs to be smarter and it can integrate to this. If you're -- It
really depends on the type of enterprise you're in. But as a generalization, I see workFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-14

Page 10 of 14Q - Mandeep Singh
A - Wayne Kurtzmanmanagement being very big. I see marketing and CRM integrating. I see
communications to customers, partners and the like becoming huge. So I did say
that enterprise communities would lag a little bit, but accelerate. In fact, they're
accelerating a little more than I thought right now, but they will have a longer tail in
their growth.
So really all of those and then it becomes very business unique and where
businesses are going. As a result of COVID-19, companies that did certain things
three years ago may be doing a diﬀerent ﬂavor of them three years from now. And a
good example of that is if you take some of the largest companies, Walmart, Target, I
can go down the full list, John Deere, they are -- they have developer portals, where
they are making code and sharing code, they are essentially becoming developers
and sharing the code with others, not just their partners, but beyond.
Full developer portals, so they're growing to a diﬀerent level of digital
transformation and I think you see the most aggressive companies in moving or
growing toward being developers and powering citizen developers. There is a lot of
low code, no code. That allows you to customize collaborative applications for your
own use and it does not. And we're seeing developers come in not at IP level, but at
the line of business level. And that's a signiﬁcant change from three years ago that
will accelerate right now because a number of the vendors are just making it easier
to code and automate certain things.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Do you expect salesforce.com, SAP or Adobe to get into this market either with their
own tools, because they want collaboration and conferencing capabilities from
within their software or they are more likely to partner with the likes of Zoom and
Slack?
Both, actually. Adobe has been partnering more aggressively. Salesforce has a really
nice solution called Quip. They purchased that a number of years ago, their former
CEO is now, I just can't remember his position, in charge of product. He is
signiﬁcantly inﬂuencing the direction of Salesforce, but also the acquisition of
MuleSoft was huge for Salesforce because it enabled Salesforce to become more of
an open API software. They realize that the future comes with integration to whatever
their customers need to work and have it integrated in the CRM and bringing their
marketing to tightly integrate with the AI and ML (inaudible).
So Salesforce have -- they have a great developer portal to all those companies like
you mentioned. But Salesforce is actually starting to use in my view, bringing Quip
more front and center as a collaborative platform for many things and they've done
some very clever work around that.
So yes, expect that collaboration will be there, will they play in it? I think Adobe has
made an active decision to be something that you need in your business, but they
don't have to be the collaborative tool. Salesforce is there, but I don't see them yet.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-14

years ahead and say, "hey, this is a collaborative platform".
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Got it. And we've talked at length about video conferencing and e-mail
collaboration, but what about content management? So we have two or three
vendors like Box, Dropbox who really focus on content management and this is one
kind of segment within cloud software that hasn't taken oﬀ as well as you know the
video conferencing and Slack collaboration we discussed. So, any thoughts around
the prospects or Box and Dropbox?
Yeah. Drop -- Box and Dropbox fall into that, it just works category. You plug it in, it
just works. It doesn't take a long time for IT to properly provision the security
governance and compliance that they need. Is very straightforward. There is a lot of
promise. That is, I'm sorry I've left out from my earlier answer. Because with all -- with
everything happening in the market with the discussion of knowledge management,
all of this is based on content and the newer forms of content coming in including
AR, user generated content becomes increasingly important as it has been.
So content, as a whole, becomes really important and a place to keep it becomes
really important, and from that point of view, Box and Dropbox continue to have
some features that others don't. And they're becoming preferred sources to
integrate because they were made to be integrated. Many of the companies in the
last 10 to 11 years, they are very focused on APIs that integrate and they're very
focused on security.

Got it. Okay. So in terms of the deployment model, like you mentioned, a lot of these
companies, started oﬀ as freemium products. But do you think they are going to look
for ways to do more enterprise wide deployments. And if yes, then what do you think
will be the tipping point for enterprises to deploy these tools company wide as
opposed to certain lines of businesses that end up using a Zoom or Slack, while
others are using something else and the whole organization is probably using some
on-premise tool?
Yeah, I don't see a lot of on-prem. I see some, but as we go down that there will be
some consolidation around the likes of video collaborate -- video conferencing tools
because people want to be able to use the same thing and it should just work. I'm
going back to that ﬁrst slide with almost every answer. People need things that just
work and CIOs need things that aren't going to cause some problems. It's just that
two ended sword and a lot of the products in here do just that. Yeah. Go on.

Page 12 of 14A - Wayne KurtzmanIs there -- I think people on this call look for numbers and they're trying to ﬁgure out,
okay, what's the durability of growth? Once this virus situation is under control. I
mean, and people will return back to oﬃces. Is this more hype and or there is a
demand that's going to last for a few years, simply because these -- and if there is a
way to quantify, that's why I have that enterprise-wide deployment question because
at the end of the day, that's what's going to drive adoption. You will always have
certain lines of business who are using both for their teams, which will result in 10 to
15 people are using certain tool, but that's not what will drive the broader adoption.
And that's where I was trying to get to, is there a tipping point and if yes, how can
people look for cues around? Okay, this is where you say, yeah, everyone realizes
these tools are much better. And they will look into those places what they had and
go for these enterprise-wide and here is how you can monitor that sort of activity?
Yeah. Thank you for refreshing me on that. On the enterprise adoption, most of the
companies that I've named have seen -- have had a growth rate within companies of
about 20% a year. Some 14%, some a little more than that, but the land and expand
has been very successful for a lot of these companies. Whether we're talking about a
Slack, whether we're talking about a Zoom, whether the ability to go enterprise wide
was accelerated because of COVID-19.
The tipping point, I do see growth in all of these markets for at least the next ﬁve
years. The year-over-year growth isn't going to be hard to beat 2020, but as a
percentage, but there will be continued growth, because not everyone jumped on
their ideal solution yet.
So the tipping point is still coming. I think ﬁrst, it's going to come, we already accept
video conferencing, because we do FaceTime, we do Google Duo, we do Skype. We
do all these things Zoom at home. And if you don't, most people do right now. And
the adoption of video ranges depending on the solution from 40% increase to 200%
increase. Everyone has seen an increase in video to help people do people things
even extended meetings.
Team collaboration is going to come [ph] a little behind. It's something that is
important and that chat layer becomes important too, and those are starting to
deploy. The enterprise adoption. Yes, it's going to get pushed out wider. One of the
big challenges is, if companies wanted to go, wall to wall as a solution sometimes
had a little bit of a challenge internally doing it ﬁrst. The easy part was getting the
licenses sometimes. Well, I understand for the ﬁrst week or two, phones where --
they try to reach people by phone and it was easier to do it online. So they started
maneuvering to that.
The tipping point for collaboration is, you're going to see groups where managers
become facilitators not just command and control, which is a core change in
collaboration and in those groups, they are going to exceed production
considerably a big trade is getting things done, getting to market earlier and getting
projects done ahead of schedule, something we see time and time again where thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-14

Q - Mandeep Singh
A - Wayne Kurtzmantype of adoption happens whether it's done at line of business or enterprise. This
will keep growing because people will be brought in. This is what we see normally, I
want to use them too. It just works.
And if you don't have a good video system, you will see that. I need to use the same
collab tool you're using or I need something diﬀerent. Maybe I need a kanban
board, maybe I need a Trello, Asana or Wrike to plug in. But I wanted to also
communicate to you and you'll be able to communicate to me. So thus maybe a
Slack or Teams integration become necessary. So you will see diﬀerent things, but
you will see an interoperability between several tools that enable that seamless work
and more collaborative work because we are talking about the curation of data and
how this is done and how we can do it better. And looking for new opportunities as
an enterprise and some of that's going to come through citizen developers within
the enterprise, but they're going to come around the products that support free and
open APIs where the IT manager, where the CIO can say, this is not what I want
getting to these people. This is what I do and manage the permissions at a whole
things that support e-discovery.
We're seeing a lot of that and we're seeing a lot of the -- a lot of those certiﬁcations
also haven't been gone over. So there are a lot of solutions out there and the
question is, how many of them are going to be in the top ﬁve. And I think we could
see a good ﬁve or six strong ones in the collaboration market. In less there is a
sudden marching moment, but certainly Teams is seeing that increased adoption,
Slack is seeing crazy strong adoption and many of the other players in the market
are seeing very strong adoption, too, and they're integrating. They're integrating
those tools. I've been getting a lot of questions about the security of the integrations
and the integrations and I'm getting the feeling that the CIOs are happy.

And lastly, any sense of the installed base for these top three vendors, three or four
vendors, you talked about today, Microsoft Teams, Google G Suite, Zoom and Slack?
I'm sorry, I just missed the ﬁrst part of that a little bit.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Yeah, so I was hoping if you can give our listeners a sense of the installed base for
these four or ﬁve products like Microsoft Teams, how big is their installed base
relative to Slack or you know --
Let's handle them one at a time. I don't have new installed base numbers because
those suddenly changed over the last two months, and they haven't been giving out.
With Microsoft, I'm more interested in the adoption. Stewart Butterﬁeld, CEO of
Slack did mention yesterday that -- and the numbers look great that yes, Teams has
about 20% adoption to the Microsoft Oﬃce stack, but I think as they announcedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 14 of 14Q - Mandeep Singhnumbers, it will be higher, people will use Teams because they have it, it's not
diﬃcult to learn. They have some good videos out on that.
Slack has seen tremendous adoption. I -- they haven't given me numbers to indicate
just how much they've grown, but one of the things of note is I think that they've
done very -- in my opinion, they've done very well at maintaining that global growth.
One of the other things that are changing for all these players is, the percentage of
revenue per country. Those dynamics are changing fairly substantially I would think
over the last two months. So the question is where? Certainly, US makes up a
majority. The Zoom installed base again, I'm more curious how many drop-oﬀs
they're going to have as things get better? Or are they going to retain it because
prior to COVID-19, a number of folks, especially in their 20s and 30s were consumer
purchasers of Zoom for family reasons and that number has gone up, but focused on
business, I think they've had to go quickly to land and expand. And with some -- with
the exception of one glitch did really well. I think in expanding Cisco Webex has
done very well, but again they haven't been talking about numbers, they've been
going between some of the numbers, and I'm not comfortable yet saying they have
this many or will retain this many.
But I do think, as a rule, will see a, if you exclude consumer behavior, you will see
probably an 80% or better retention rate at business. The longer this goes, the
higher that number will go, and the reason is, you can't pluck something that works
out of the workforce.

Got it. That's all I had. And I don't see any further questions in our queue. So that
concludes our webinar. Thank you all for joining today. Hope this was useful. Reach
out to us, if you have any further questions. Replay of the webinar will be available
later. And let's hope this challenging situation is over soon. Everyone stay safe and
healthy.
