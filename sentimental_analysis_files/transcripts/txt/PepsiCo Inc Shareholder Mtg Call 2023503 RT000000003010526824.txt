Good morning, everyone. Welcome to PepsiCo's 2023 Annual Meeting of
Shareholders. Let's begin by introducing each of my fellow directors who are on the
line. Olusegun Agbaje, Cesar Conde, Ian Cook, Edith Cooper, Dina Dublon, Michelle
Gass, Sir Dave Lewis, Dave Page, Bob Pollard, Dan Vasella, Darren Walker, and
Alberto Weiser.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-03

Page 2 of 21I also would like to thank Director, Shona Brown, who's not for re-election, for her 14
years of service on the board. Shona has been a key advisor on many complex issues
over the years, and she leaves the board and our company stronger and more
resilient.
With Shona's departure, I'm excited that we're joined today by two new director
nominees. Jennifer Bailey, who will bring extensive knowledge of the information
technology ﬁeld and consumer marketing from her nearly 20 years of experience
leading various functions at Apple, including her current role as Vice President of
Internet Services for Apple Pay. Susan Diamond, who will bring deep knowledge of
ﬁnancial, accounting, strategic, and healthcare matters from her more than 15-year
career in the healthcare industry, including her current role as Chief Financial Oﬃcer
and previously as President of the Home Solution Business of Humana Inc
I know Jennifer and Susan will make fantastic additions to our Board and we look
forward to welcoming them. They will join an outstanding group of directors, and I
would like to start by thanking the board for their critical guidance and for the
partnership over the past year.
Like many companies, in 2022, we continue to be challenged by a number of
external forces and trends. Despite these diﬃcult and unpredictable circumstances,
2022 was a stellar year for PepsiCo We delivered our best ﬁnancial performance in a
decade, while staying true to our values and continuing to build a strong, durable
foundation for long-term growth. In many ways, our success in 2022 is a testament to
the agenda we set out in 2019. That year, we set out on an agenda to go from good
to great and become a faster, stronger, and better company so we can deliver
durable, sustainable growth over the long term.
Our primary objectives were to accelerate top-line growth, sharpen our productivity
agenda, and make necessary investments in our business and brands to build
advantage capabilities and win in the marketplace. Towards the end of 2021, we took
our ambitions a step further by launching pep Positive, a strategic end to end
transformation of our business, a transformation that is about driving long-term
sustainable performance for our company was building a more sustainable for
people and for the planet. Since then, pep Positive has become our Northstar, a key
part of our overarching vision to be the global leader in convenient foods and
beverages by winning with pep Positive.
2022's fantastic results demonstrate that even in the most trying times, the
investments and progress we've made towards our pep Positive goals are helping us
become even faster, even stronger, and even better. We're becoming even faster by
focusing on continually winning in the marketplace, ﬁnding ways to be more
consumer-centric, and accelerating investment for top-line growth, including by
transforming our portfolio. Since 2018, our advertising and marketing spend has
increased over 20%, reﬂecting investments across our large brands and our smaller
brands. We have also increased the portion of our working media spend to optimize
the return on investment of our A&M spend, while continuing to support the growth
of our brands.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 21Additionally, our net capital spending has increased signiﬁcantly since 2018. We've
invested in increasing our manufacturing capacity to oﬀer more convenience and
variety across channels, while also investing in our go-to-market systems and
modernizing our technology backbone. As a result of these eﬀorts, we ended 2022
by delivering our ﬁfth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth
and our second consecutive year of double-digit constant currency earnings per
share growth.
In 2022, we're able to continue to perform whilst we transform. We deliver more
than 14% organic revenue growth and 8.7% net revenue growth. We achieve a 10%
growth in core constant currency operating proﬁt with a 9% growth in core gross
proﬁt. We deliver 11% growth in core constant currency earnings per share and our
North America businesses deliver 14% organic revenue growth with each division
delivering strong double-digit organic revenue growth, and then our international
businesses grew organic revenue by 16% for the full year.
We also continue to invest in our future success with more than $10 billion in
advertising and marketing and capital investments. And we announced a 10%
increase in our annualized dividend eﬀective with the dividend expected to be paid
in June 2023. This will represent PepsiCo's 51st consecutive annualized dividend per
share increase. And ﬁnally, at the end of 2022, our ﬁve-year total shareholder return
of plus 74.3% outperformed well ahead of the category with 52.6% and the S&P 500
with 56.8%.
We're pleased that our pivot to growth is continuing to deliver outstanding results in
2023. In Q1 of this year, organic revenue increased 14.3%, our sixth straight quarter of
double-digit growth. Core constant currency earnings per share increased 18%. And
just last week, our stock closed at an all-time high of $189.71 per share.
In addition to our strong ﬁnancial performance, we've demonstrated an ability to
lead with growth and win the market. In 2022, we ranked number one in the counter
power ranking for the seventh year in a row. We held or gained a share across many
of our key markets, including the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, the UK, China, Saudi Arabia,
and India. And we continue to meet consumers' needs and improve the consumer
experience with signiﬁcant growth in more positive snacking choices and zero-sugar
platforms.
We're becoming even stronger by continuing to transform our capabilities, our costs,
our culture, especially through digitalization and putting data at the center of our
business. We also want our associates to continue to feel proud of our company and
even more engaged. With these goals in mind, in 2022, we made strong progress
towards modernizing and fortifying our enterprise resource planning backbone,
harmonizing global data and business processes with seamless access to critical
information across certain markets and divisions.
We continue to build out global business services to help fuel PepsiCo's growth,
accelerating the impact GBS can have on productivity, standardization, and processFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 4 of 21improvement. We initiated key digital programs in many markets to advance the
automation of our business planning processes across the full value chain. We
celebrated the 40th anniversary of our Supplier Diversity Program, where we
currently spend more than $1 billion annually with certiﬁed and diverse suppliers. We
continue to invest in talent development and learning to become the best possible
workplace. And we double down on our company culture by relaunching the
PepsiCo Way, the seven behaviors that deﬁne who we are and how we work.
And then ﬁnally, we're also becoming an even better company by striving to create
growth and value in a way that respects planetary boundaries and inspires positive
change for people for the planet. We know that by doing what's right for society and
the environment we can position ourselves a second performer, who can generate
stronger, more loyal connections with our consumers and with our customers. We
can engage more meaningfully with our associates and we can build deeper roots in
our communities to help them prosper over the long term.
This strategic end-to-end focus has enabled us to make visible progress across the
three pillars of Pep Positive. Positive Agriculture, positive value chain, and positive
choices. When it comes to Positive Agriculture, we're working to spread regenerative
agriculture practices to help restore the earth across 7 million acres, which is land
approximately equal to the company's entire agricultural footprint. We're also aiming
to sustainably source key crops and ingredients, and help improve the livelihoods of
more than 250,000 people in our agriculture supply chain and communities, all by
2030.
In 2022, we move closer to these goals by elevating the external strategic
partnerships, including our work with ADM to scale regenerative agriculture
practices across our share supply chains, up to 2 million acres only in the U.S. and
with N-Drip to scale micro-irrigation technology that can provide water-saving, crop-
enhancing beneﬁts to farmers all around the world.
We're continuing to advance the global development alliance around investing in
women to strengthen supply chains. A partnership with the U.S. agency for
international development that is working to train women to be lead farmers in
Colombia, Pakistan, India, and Vietnam, and soon to be in Peru as well. And we've
continued to expand our demonstration farm programs. As of the end of 2022, we
have 78 demonstration farms around the world, creating a peer-to-peer network that
helps farmers apply regenerative agriculture techniques, overcome challenges, and
share best practices.
For example, on 45 demonstration farms in India, we were able to improve yield and
reduce GSG emissions. Our eﬀorts resulted in a farmer income increase of $56 per
acre on average. And on our seven demonstration farms in Thailand, we have
reached over 800 farms to implement pest and nutrient management practices and
install drip irrigation systems. With a positive value chain, we're helping to drive
circularity and inclusivity through actions designed for PepsiCo to achieve net zero
emissions by 2040, become net water positive by 2030, and help build a world
where packaging never becomes waste.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 5 of 21As part of this, we're adopting new models and working to decouple environmental
impact from business growth. In 2022, we took important steps such as establishing
a new global packaging goal for 20% of beverage servings to be delivered through
reusable models by 2030, by expanding our solid stream business, building out our
reﬁllable oﬀerings, growing our fountains drinks business with reusable caps, and
accelerating growth in powders and in tablets.
We also announced a goal for PepsiCo Europe that aims to eliminate virgin fossil-
based plastic in all its crisps and cheap bags by 2030. These new goals will build
upon existing packaging sustainability goals and our aspirations for more circular
packaging. For example, at the end of 2022, all sectors with a beverage portfolio
have now launched 100% recycled PET in our CSDs brands, and 22 markets now
have at least one product package with 100% ARPET. We achieved zero freshwater
consumption in our Vallejo plant in Mexico city, one of the PepsiCo's largest snack
plants, where we spent a total of 217 days without drawing a drop of water from the
municipal supply.
We're transforming our Frito-Lay facility in Modesto, California into a role model for
end-to-end sustainability. The facility uses 100% sustainable water under PepsiCo's
sustainable farming program and has achieved a 91% reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions from direct ﬂeet operations by switching to zero emissions and near-zero-
emission vehicles, including the world's ﬁrst ﬂeet of electric semi-trucks from Tesla.
We continue to make a diﬀerence for people around the world through the PepsiCo
Foundation. The foundation is helping to increase equitable access to safe water and
promote food security, delivering more than 20 million meals in 2022. We launch
One Smile at a Time, our global employee volunteering platform across nearly all of
our top 20 markets, empowering our associates to impact their communities at
scale.
In 2022, we delivered more than 290,000 hours of service through the platform.
And we're continuing to advance our diversity, equity, and inclusion agenda around
our people, business partnerships, and the communities we serve. Women hold 44%
of our global manager positions, while U.S. Black and Hispanic representation at the
manager level stands at 9% and 10.1%, respectively. We're also expanding our eﬀorts
to support historically marginalized communities around the world by increasing
diverse representation, supporting our business partners, and helping to create
economic opportunities in local communities. Then last but not least, when it comes
to positive choices, we're inspiring people through our brands to make decisions
that help create better outcomes for themselves and for the planet.
That includes continuing to expand our oﬀerings with less added sugar, sodium, and
saturated fat whilst driving new packaging solutions across beverages and
convenient foods. In 2022, we made progress on a number of key initiatives,
including advancing more positive choices platforms with signiﬁcant growth in North
America, driven by brands like PopCorners, SunChips, and Bayer. With the launch of
innovative ﬂavors, expansion into broader pack sizes, including single-serve and
multi-packs, and distribution gates, international markets advance as well, with
expanded compression popping launches in the UK and in China.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 21David FlavellWe're also using more diverse ingredients, such as legumes, whole grains, plant-
based proteins, fruit and veggies, and nuts and seeds. This includes launching
SunChips Black Bean, a new variety made with whole grains and real black beans,
and new Quaker oats ﬂavors made with 100% whole grain oats. We continue to
make good progress against our sodium reduction goal of 75% by 2025, with both
product renovations, such as Sabritas Adobadas in Mexico, Cheetos in Egypt, and
Kurkure Masala in India, and portfolio innovation solutions, such as the Simply brand
of potato chips and tortilla chips in Australia, and Walker's 45% less salt in the UK.
We're also advancing against our added sugar reduction targets. For 2022, we
expect to achieve 55% of our global beverage portfolio's sugar reduction goal, a
good progress to our goal of 67% by 2025. Driven by improvements in developed
markets and led by the growth of zero sugar and hydration products.
In fact, we're very pleased that Pepsi Zero is now available in 110 international
markets and our low zero-sugar Gatorade portfolio which includes Gatorade Zero,
G-Fit, Gatorlite, and G2 has grown signiﬁcantly, reaching a total of nearly $2 billion in
U.S. retail sales value over the last year, and outgrowing the full Gatorade portfolio.
And ﬁnally, in 2022 we progressed our eﬀorts on innovative packaging solutions
with Beyond the Bottle. We began rebranding eﬀorts on SodaStream to improve the
consumer experience and revitalize the brand. We also continue to scale our
SodaStream Flavors portfolio, with additional brand launches of Rockstar in
Germany, and Bubbly Bounce and Pepsi in the U.S. The use of our SodaStream
Flavors last year supported the avoidance of roughly 1 billion single-used bottles,
and we recently transitioned 100% of our SodaStream Flavor bottles in all of our
markets to 100% clear recycled plastic. Each example of our success is one piece of
a much larger transformation, a transformation that began in 2019 and reached new
heights in 2022.
When we showed the world that it is possible for a large global company to perform
and transform at the same time. Thanks to Pep Positive, our strong brands, our
market positions, our global strategy, and our incredible team, we've been able to
deliver short-term results was laying the foundation for long-term sustainable
growth.
I've always been proud of our performance, but never more than this year. Once we
know the future, it will bring a lot of new challenges, we also know it will bring new
opportunities. And when they arise, we've proven that we'll be ready, that we have
what it takes to build a company that wins in the marketplace and possibly impact,
not just today, not just tomorrow, but for many years to come. Thank you all for
sharing our conﬁdence by entrusting us with your investment. And thank you for
your participation in this year's annual meeting.
Now, I will turn it over to David Flavell, Executive Vice President, General Counsel,
and Corporate Secretary, who will serve as the secretary of the meeting and guide us
through the agenda.

Page 7 of 21Thank you, Mr.Chairman. We've designed the format of this virtual meeting to
provide shareholders with the same rights and opportunities to participate as they
would at an in-person meeting. As is our custom, we will conduct the business
portion of our meeting ﬁrst, and answer questions at the end of this meeting. The
meeting agenda and rules of conduct are available on the meeting website. We ask
that all review those items, and we appreciate your cooperation with the rules of
conduct.
As a reminder, shareholders attending the virtual meeting can vote their shares
online from now through the closing of the polls by logging into the meeting
website as a shareholder and clicking the Vote Here button at the bottom of their
screen. If you have previously voted by proxy and do not wish to change your vote,
your vote will be cast as you previously instructed and no further action is required.
We've received questions that were submitted by shareholders in advance of today's
meeting that we will address during the Q&A session as time permits. If you have
logged into the meeting website as a shareholder, you may submit a question by
selecting a topic and typing your question in the ﬁeld labeled enter a question.
To ensure that we receive your questions before the Q&A session is closed, submit
your questions now. Though we may not be able to answer every question, we will
do our best to provide a response to as many questions as possible. To give
everyone a chance to ask a question, we will limit each shareholder to one question.
Questions on the same topic or that are otherwise related may be grouped,
summarised, and answered together. Consistent with state law and our bylaws, a list
of shareholders entitled to notice of this meeting has been available for inspection at
our principal oﬃce since 23 March 2023.
The Inspectors of Elections, Beth Vanderbeek and Matthew Crescenzo from
Broadridge Investor Communications Solutions are attending the meeting today and
have previously taken the oath as Inspectors of Election at this meeting. I have been
informed by the Inspector of Elections that a majority of the votes entitled to be cast
at this meeting are represented by proxy. And therefore, we have the necessary
quorum under state law and our by-laws.
Now that we have a quorum, I declare this meeting to be duly convened for the
purposes of transacting such business as we may properly come before it in
accordance with State law and our by-laws. The polls are open for voting. We will
close the polls after the proposals have been presented. We will now proceed with
the formal business of this meeting. Because we did not receive notice of any
additional matters to be considered beyond those in the proxy, no other proposals
or nominations may be introduced at this meeting. We'll begin with our ﬁrst agenda
item, which is the election of directors. I place before the meeting to serve as
directors for the coming year, the 15 individuals whose names and biographies
appear in our proxy statement. Our Board recommends a vote for each of the
nominees for director.
The second agenda item is the ratiﬁcation of the appointment of KPMG as the
company's independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for 2023, which I nowFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-03

representing KPMG, and will be available to answer any question during the
question-and-answer session of the meeting. Our board recommends a vote for the
ratiﬁcation of the appointment of KPMG as PepsiCo's independent registered public
accounting ﬁrm for 2023.
The third agenda item is the advisory vote to approve the compensation of the
named executive oﬃces identiﬁed in our proxy statement, which I now place before
the meeting. Our board recommends a vote for the advisory resolution to approve
executives. The fourth agenda item is the advisory vote on the frequency of future
shareholders' advisory approval of executive compensation which I now place
before the meeting. Our Board recommends a vote for every one year with respect
to how frequently a shareholder advisory approval of the compensation of named
executive oﬃcers should occur.
We'll now move on to the shareholder proposals in the order that they appear in the
agenda. Each of the shareholders or their representatives will have three minutes to
present their respective proposals. Now we'll turn to the ﬁrst shareholder proposal,
requesting that the company adopt a policy and amend its governing documents as
necessary to require the separation of the oﬃces of the Chairman of the Board and
the Chief Executive Oﬃcer, which are admitted by the National Legal and Policy
Centre. Mr.Paul Chesser will be presenting the proposal as its representative.
Operator, please open the line for Mr.Chesser.
Good morning. Like every other company that opposes independent chair policies,
Pepsi's board members say they want to quote retain the ﬂexibility that allows them
to combine the chair and CEO. What this really means is, we want to make up the
rules as we go along, or more plainly, we don't want any rules. Almost every other
structured hierarchy, whether they be businesses, governments, NGOs, et cetera
have rules for their leadership roles, but not Pepsi's Board. They want a combined
Chair and CEO if they feel like it, or they don't want a combined Chair and CEO if
they don't feel like it. It all just depends on what day you ask them. This is no way to
run a multinational corporation.
Now, Pepsi, like every other company with a combined Chair and CEO, proudly
states that they have a quote robust lead independent director with a supposedly
strong list of responsibilities. The Board cites Mr.Cook, who presides in that role, and
one of the things they are proud of that he created was the Board's sustainability,
diversity, and Public Policy Committee. I'm not surprised the Board is proud of this
committee, because it invokes the two most favorite terms of woke corporate
America, sustainability and diversity.
I'm sure the Board would cite the most superﬁcial of diversity terms by pointing out
its member's skin colors and genders, although I'm not sure two sexes are enough
these days to accomplish adequate gender diversity. Nonetheless, Pepsi's BoardFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 9 of 21Ramon L. Laguartalacks diversity in one signiﬁcant area, and that's ideological diversity. Research of
each director's campaign contribution shows the Board is dominated by one side of
the political spectrum. And looking at the woke initiatives that Mr.Laguarta involves
the company in, it's easy to tell which political side the company is on.
For example, after pandering to the anti-police Black Lives Matter movement in $400
million increased black lives presentation at PepsiCo and quote, you can see that
while the company refuses to be colorblind, it is certainly woke. Our destroyed inner
cities have paid the price because of its support for that. And Pepsi certainly played
with ﬁre by announcing a Cracker Jill brand counterpart to its beloved Cracker Jack.
The company announced that the campaign is quote fueled by powerful female and
non-binary voices, end quote. In case you haven't noticed, Bud Light is suﬀering a
brand meltdown over a so-called non-binary campaign.
Pepsi's board may think its earnings are good, but all it takes is one woke false step
and your company is in a tailspin, just ask Anheuser-Busch. Pepsi may think it's
diverse, but in reality it is uniformly woke. So if we can't convince you to separate the
Chairman and CEO, how about you infuse the Board with some diﬀerent ideological
views at least? We're ready to start the conversation with you. Please vote for
proposal number ﬁve.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
So thank you, Mr.Chesser. Our Board has carefully considered this proposal,
including a review of market trends and feedback from our shareholders on a nearly
identical and also unsuccessful proposal in 2022. And believes that it is important to
have the ﬂexibility to determine whether the roles of the Chairman and the CEO
should be separate or should be combined based on the company's needs. The
Board has deep knowledge of the strategic goals of the company, the unique
opportunities and also the unique challenges that the company faces, and the
various capabilities of our Directors and the company's Senior Management.
Therefore, the Board is best positioned to determine the most eﬀective leadership
structure to protect and to enhance long-term shareholder value. Our Board
currently believes that PepsiCo and our shareholders are best served by a combined
Chairman and CEO role, together with a strong independent presiding director.
PepsiCo has a track record of strong long-term performance under this combined
leadership structure. The Board also believes that our strong corporate governance
policies and practices provide for an objective and independent board leadership
structure necessary to oversee management and the key issue facing the company.
Among other things, we have a diverse and experienced Board comprised entirely
of independent directors except for the Chairman and CEO. All Board committees
comprise solely of and Chair by independent directors. And there are regular
executive sessions of the board and its committees without the presence of the CEO
and other members of management.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-03

Page 10 of 21David Flavell
Unidentiﬁed SpeakerThe nominating and corporate governance committee revisits the leadership
structure regularly as part of its ongoing board assessment process to determine
whether it remains in the best interest of our shareholders to keep that structure. For
these reasons, the Board believes that the action requested by the proposal is
neither necessary nor is in the best interest of PepsiCo or our shareholders, and
recommends that shareholders do not support this proposal.
{BIO 22140116 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr.Chairman. The second shareholder proposal on the ballot is
requesting a global transparency report submitted by John C. Harrington of
Harrington Investments.
Miss Alexandra Parra will be presenting the proposal as his representative. Operator,
please open the line for Miss Parra.
Thank you, Mr.Chair. Marimari Kampulamian, this is the salutation in Mapusungun,
the language of the Mapuche people, the rightful owners of the territory where I live.
Thank you for this opportunity to introduce item six on behalf of Harrington
Investments, regarding the importance of PepsiCo's global political transparency. I
am Alejandra Parra, representing the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives,
GAIA, and the Recycling Plastics Movement. I am also a member of the Chilean Zero
Waste Alliance and Co-founder of the Environmental Rights Action Network in
Temuco, Chile. There can be no doubt that PepsiCo is a major polluter of the
environment.
In 2022, PepsiCo was named the world's second-biggest plastic polluter. PepsiCo
has made commitments to tackle its plastic pollution, and yet the company's
membership and political activities tell another story. The importance of
transparency on global public policy and political inﬂuence cannot be overstated,
especially at a time when the world's governments are negotiating a new global
treaty to stop plastic pollution. And to be clear, there are many ways to inﬂuence
legislation beyond providing direct contributions to politicians.
For example, in the international political sphere, PepsiCo is one of only two
consumer goods companies who are members of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste.
Its members are predominantly fossil fuel and petrochemical giants, and an analysis
by Planet Tracker found the Alliance had made paltry progress towards its objective
and labeled the Alliance barely credible. The same analysis found 68% of the
founding funding members of the alliance are also members of the American
Chemistry Council, an organization actively campaigning against restrictions on
plastic production within the global plastic treaty.
At the country level, there are also numerous examples of PepsiCo's opaque political
activities to draw upon corporation claims. Pepsi is a member of the PhilippineFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 11 of 21Ramon L. LaguartaAlliance for Recycling and material sustainability, which successfully watered down
an extended producer responsibility law.
These trade associations does not feature on PepsiCo's disclosed 2022 list of trade
associations, nor does the alliance to end plastic waste. If PepsiCo is truly committed
to sustainability and transparency, it should end its membership in the alliance and
trade associations in against plastic pollution laws, including laws that prohibit the
plastic waste trade, a new form of colonialism that is seriously aﬀecting countries
from the global south. Shareholders have a right to be advocated for in Pepsi's
name, whether these activities align with the corporation's publicly stated values and
commitments, and the risk it presents to their investments. This is why we urge
investors and shareholders to vote yes on item six. Thank you.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Thank you, Mrs.Parra. Listen, we recognize the need for corporations to ensure
strong activities, as well as to provide full transparency with respect to their advocacy
and related actions. And we work hard for oversight and abundant corporate
transparency around this topic. We have not and do not plan to make any political
contributions to candidates outside of the U.S., although no international political
contributions are currently planned. It is stated on our website that we would
disclose any international contributions on our website along with all of our U.S.
contributions. We also follow all national transparency rules regarding the disclosure
of our contributions to trade associations, and we publish a global list of key trade
association memberships organized by contribution amounts.
As a general rule, the trade associations with which we engage internationally do not
provide contributions to political candidates, and we expect our associations to
inform PepsiCo, the company if they were to begin engaging in this way.
With respect to scientiﬁc research, we believe that adherence to ethical principles is
essential and that we have adopted the PepsiCo position on the conduct of scientiﬁc
research. The position outlines our guiding principles on transparency conﬂicts of
interest and minimizing bias and best practices with respect to PepsiCo-sponsored
research and research conducted by PepsiCo associates with external research
partners. Among other things, we require sponsored researchers to follow accepted
principles of scientiﬁc rigor in order to adequately test the stated hypotheses and
assure the accuracy of data produced.
In addition, the position states that we will make available on our website links to
PepsiCo-funded research at the time of publication in a peer-reviewed journal, and
two, we will be fully transparent about our role in the design, implementation, and
analysis of the research, as well as in funding when promoting the ﬁndings of
sponsors research. We also do not make charitable contributions for purposes of
political inﬂuence. Most of our international cash donation contributions in 2022
were made through the PepsiCo Foundation. And all charitable contributions made
by the Foundation are publicly disclosed in its U.S. tax returns.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-03

{BIO 22140116 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr.Chairman. The third shareholder proposal on the ballot is requesting
a report on impacts of reproductive healthcare legislation submitted by long view
Large Cap 500 index. Ms.Lyndsay Fritz is presenting the proposal as its
representative. Operator, please open the line for Ms.Fritz.
Good morning. My name is Lyndsay Fritz. I am the First Vice President of Corporate
Social Responsibility at Amalgamated Bank, a shareholder in PepsiCo, and the
proponent of proposal number seven. I formally move this proposal requesting that
Pepsi issue a public report describing risks to the company caused by state policies
that restrict access to healthcare for women, as well as strategies Pepsi might use to
mitigate these risks.
On its gender parity website, Pepsi states, quote, gender equality is a fundamental
human right, we do often laws and societal norms prevent women from participating
at all levels of leadership, end quote. We agree. Pepsi as a result of politicians'
decisions now faces challenges in providing employees with the health care they
want and need. Since the Supreme Court reversed throw versus made [ph] 15 states
have banned most abortion services outright. Nine states are also currently limiting
access to emergency contraception. It is estimated these changes impact one in
three women within reproductive years in America, as well as their partners and
families.
The patchwork of restrictions is becoming unmanageable for patients and health
care and insurance providers, and is a risk that should be managed by the company.
The question of how PepsiCo will provide comprehensive and equitable
reproductive health care to its employees is not hypothetical or relevant. A
signiﬁcant majority of the companies existing in the future workforce, those that
currently work for the company and those wishes to recruit, are within their
reproductive years. Of Pepsi's new hires in 2021, approximately 95% were under 50
years old.
However, Pepsi has yet to show investors that it has adequately assessed risks
associated with reproductive health care restrictions. In Pepsi's lack of response,
intertwining threats increase, including threats to employee well-being, health and
morale, threats to corporate reputation and brand, threats to consumer loyalty,
threats to women's ability to advance within the company, and threats to the
attainment of the company's diversity and inclusion goals. Employees want andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-03

requesting today is necessary to address the risks presented by the patchwork of
laws, and legislative action that have threatened access to reproductive health care
for employees in states where PepsiCo has operations.
Thank you, Mr.Chairman and Mr.Secretary.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you, Ms.Fritz. Let me provide you an overview of what is the Board's
position on this proposal. We believe that the future success of PepsiCo really
depends on our ability to hire and to retain the most talented people. To meet this
goal, PepsiCo is committed to creating meaningful opportunities for all employees,
including women to work, to gain new skills, and to build successful careers, along
with maintaining a diverse and inclusive workplace. As part of our eﬀorts to attract, to
retain, and advance our employees, we oﬀer comprehensive and competitive health
and wellness beneﬁts. And we remain committed to ensuring that our employees
and their families have access to quality medical care and resources to support their
physical and their mental well-being, including, of course, reproductive health.
In the U.S., PepsiCo's self-funded medical plans oﬀer comprehensive reproductive
health beneﬁts, including individualized support for women and families before,
during, and after pregnancy, including but not limited to contraception, family
planning services, fertility and surrogacy, and special newborn child beneﬁts. We
also provide access to HealthAce, a conﬁdential health advocate to help employees
navigate their health beneﬁts, including questions regarding plan coverage,
resolving issues with claims and connecting employees to resources and programs
that help meet their medical needs.
We also regularly and objectively review our beneﬁt plans and programs to conﬁrm
that they comply with applicable laws, remain competitive in the evolving
marketplaces in which we operate, and to ensure that we're supporting employees'
and their families' physical, emotional, and ﬁnancial well-being. Further, at PepsiCo,
we strive to improve the attraction, retention, and advancement of women as a key
strand of our diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy. This enables us to build a high-
caliber pipeline of talent, as well as create economic opportunity for women in the
communities in which we operate.
In the U.S., our beneﬁt programs help drive this agenda forward by fostering
inclusion through ﬂexible beneﬁts and policies, including oﬀering on-site childcare
facilities in certain locations, and marking competitive parental leave policies that
extend beyond federal guidelines. We haven't heard from our employees or
potential new hires that existing or proposed state policies restricting reproductive
rights have been an issue or concern for them in terms of accepting, maintaining, or
advancing their employment with PepsiCo We also provide various channels for
employees to speak up, and engage on topics that impact the employee
experience.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 14 of 21David Flavell
Unidentiﬁed SpeakerIn addition, we believe that the reporting called for in this proposal is neither
practicable nor a good use of company resources. The scope of the request to
report for any known, and any potential risks and costs, caused by enacted or
proposed state policies is so broad that it would involve a complex review of the
current and ever-evolving proposed laws and regulations in the number of states in
which we operate and or we have employees.
It is also not clear what data could be evaluated to measure the risks or costs to the
company of such policies. Given our commitment to hiring and retaining the most
talented people and our comprehensive healthcare beneﬁts and policies, we do not
believe that the requested report would provide any beneﬁts and the cost of
creating and publishing the requested report would not be a worthwhile use of
company resources.
{BIO 22140116 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr.Chairman. The fourth shareholder proposal on the ballot is requesting
a congruency report on net zero emissions policies submitted by the National
Center for Public Policy Research. Ms.Sarah Raeberg will be presenting the proposal
as its representative. Operator, please open the line for Ms.Raeberg.
Good morning, and thank you for the opportunity to speak in support of proxy item
number eight. I'm Sarah Raeberg, Deputy Director of the Free Enterprise Project at
the National Center for Public Policy Research. Reduce absolute greenhouse gas
emissions by more than 40% by 2030, and achieve net zero emissions by 2040.
That's what the company's website says about its climate change goals. So, why then
according to a third-party analysis, did PepsiCo spend roughly 3 times as much as
the average company on private air travel in 2021? This spending is estimated to
have put PepsiCo within the top 15 of U.S. companies when it comes to money spent
on private air travel, and is certainly in Congress with net zero emissions goals.
It is estimated that private jets emit far greater greenhouse than other modes of
transportation. According to one study, private jets are 5 times to 14 times more
polluting than commercial planes per passenger, and 50 times more polluting than
trains. In fact, private jets emit 2 metric tons of carbon dioxide per hour. To put this
into perspective, one ton of carbon emissions is the equivalent of driving the
circumference of the Earth. Nonetheless, and in spite of all of its climate change
virtue signaling, PepsiCo outspent most other companies on private air travel. This
sort of corporate hypocrisy and double standard leads to reputational and ﬁnancial
risk. Far too many corporate executives have rules for thee but not for the mentality,
a mentality that lectures the public on the importance of achieving net zero
emissions and using less reliable and more costly forms of energy, all while ﬂying
around on private jets and far more carbon emissions than the average American
ever will.
Now some companies have argued, including PepsiCo, that the use of private
aircraft is a necessary security precaution. But many recognizable and arguablyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 15 of 21Ramon L. Laguartaimportant individuals ﬂy commercial aircraft each and every day. It is unclear why
PepsiCo executives are any diﬀerent. That's why we believe it is important for the
company to conduct a congruency analysis that examines whether PepsiCo's rules
for executives align with its outward-facing promises. Such a report is essential to
ferreting out corporate hypocrisy that can negatively impact the company. Yes,
around me [ph] and, thank you.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you, Mrs.Roberge, I mean this also provides an overview of what is the
Board's position on this proposal. So, PepsiCo takes very seriously the issue of
climate change on our role in helping to maintain a healthy environment. We
understand both the importance of operating in an environmentally responsible
manner and its positive impact on the company's operation, employees, and the
communities where we operate and serve.
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, therefore, a critical part of our Pepsi capacity
framework, and we're striving to achieve net zero emissions by 2040. As an interim
step, we're working to reduce absolutely greenhouse gas emissions by more than
40% across our entire value chain by 2030. Our emissions target aligns to the
business ambition for 1.5% Celsius degrees pledged and has been approved by the
science-based targets initiative. As we work towards achieving these ambitions, we
provide transparent and stakeholder-centric reporting using leading reporting
protocols, including the carbon disclosure project and the task force on climate-
related ﬁnancial disclosures.
In addition, we have robust risk management and capital expenditure oversight
processes in place, which include assessing the business beneﬁts and long-term
costs, and savings associated with mitigating climate-related risks based on currently
available information and projections. For example, sustainability-related capital
expenditures are reviewed not only for the impact that it will have on our
environmental performance, including energy use and greenhouse gas emissions,
but also against business ﬁnancial metrics and value to advancing our business
strategy.
Informed by science, we target areas where our investments can have the greatest
impact while creating scalable models and partnerships to accelerate progress
across the full value chain, including planning to transition to 100% renewable
electricity through a diversiﬁed portfolio of options across all our company owned
and controlled operations globally by 2030 and across our entire franchise
operations by 2040. Investing in zero and near-zero emissions delivery vehicles for
our company-owned ﬂeets, including our recent delivery of Tesla semi-trail tracks
and partnering with others, other big suppliers to support decarbonization of the
broader transport industry. And also working to scale regenerative agriculture
practices that reduce emissions and sequester CO2 across the equivalent of our 7
million acres global agriculture footprint through eﬀorts like our demonstration farm
program. Our eﬀorts to achieve net zero emissions already include initiatives across
the entire value chain, including the use of corporate aircraft. We believe that our
corporate aircraft allows our executives to be more eﬀective as they open up newFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-03

associates in person worldwide.
Given that we have numerous facilities in many remote areas around the world, the
use of company aircraft enables our executives to reach these locations eﬃciently
and increase the time available for business purposes. While emissions from
corporate aircraft produce less than 1% of our total emissions, we have already taken
steps to reduce this impact. In 2021, we launched an internal carbon small cargo
price through our Business Travel Inset Program, or BTIP, which is helping us balance
out the carbon cost of our business air travel. With BTIP, we have added a carbon fee
to the cost of each ﬂight undertaken by employees for business travel. Collected
fees borne by the traveling employee sector, business unit, or function are then
reinvested into regenerative agriculture projects that reduce carbon emissions.
Even in our eﬀorts, including robust public reporting on our sustainability initiatives
and goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the fact that these emissions are
such a small subset of total emissions, the Board believes that the reporting called
for in this proposal is neither necessary nor a good use of company resources.
Questions And Answers
(Question And Answer)
{BIO 22140116 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr.Chairman. We'll now address questions submitted about the
proposals that we just reviewed. I remind you that time I'm allowing there'll be an
opportunity for general questions not related to the proposals after the formal
portion of the meeting is concluded. And also, we are limiting each shareholder to
one question to give everyone a chance to ask a question. Mr.Chairman, we received
a question relating to board size. The question is, why have more than seven
directors?
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Yeah. Thank you for your question. The size of our board is not unusual for a
company of PepsiCo's size. Our board is focused on maintaining a diversity of
thought, experience a background in the boardroom that can be leveraged in order
to beneﬁt PepsiCo and all of our shareholders. The board regularly evaluates its
composition in light of the company's strategy and evolving needs.
{BIO 22140116 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question we received is, why do we give shares to executives
and directors, pay them and allow them to purchase shares at a reduced rate, say
75% to 85% oﬀ the current price, and require them to hold the shares for a speciﬁed
period of time depending on the discount. Giving away shares that are created forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-03

used for such purposes should be purchased by the company on the open market.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Yeah. Thank you. Our compensation program is designed to align the interests of
PepsiCo executives with those of our shareholders. As such, the majority of pay
remains variable and at risk, with a signiﬁcant portion is delivered in equity grants
based on the company's performance compared to three-year goals to ensure that
executives are motivated to deliver on PepsiCo's objectives in conjunction with very
stringent, I think, stock ownership requirements.
Management closely monitors the granting of equity awards to mitigate any dilution
impact to existing shareholders, as the company engages in a responsible usage of
shares under its long-term incentive program. Introducing a discounted employee
share purchase plan may further dilute investor interest. Share dilution always
remains the median of our peers from the data that we have.
{BIO 22140116 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr.Chairman. The next question we received is on the level of executive
compensation. Mr.Chairman, can you please tell us about PepsiCo's compensation
program design?
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Yeah, let me try to make it short. The compensation committee works with an
independent advisor to design a market competitive program that includes short
and long-term incentives that are based on predetermined ﬁnancial and operating
goals that are linked to the company's strategy and aligned with delivering on
ﬁnancial goals communicated to shareholders. Compensation that is disclosed in the
proxy statement is the aggregated combined of total pay, including base salary,
annual incentives, long-term incentives, and some other beneﬁts. The majority of the
compensation for our executive oﬃcers remains at risk of performance-based, which
means the payouts are directly correlated and dependent on the performance of the
company, thereby aligning executives' interests with our shareholders' interests.
{BIO 22140116 <GO>}
Thank you. The next comment we received requested that all political donations and
contributions be stopped and funds used elsewhere. Mr.Chairman, could you please
provide some context around our political contribution practices?
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Yeah. I think we touched on it, but let me just reiterate a bit. Let me begin by
reiterating my comments on the third shareholder proposal, where I emphasized
PepsiCo's commitment to strong governance and full transparency in all matters
related to political contributions.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-03

Page 18 of 21A - David Flavell

A - David FlavellAs I previously stated, our political giving is limited to the United States. We believe
we have a responsibility to our employees and our shareholders, to engage elected
oﬃcials in the U.S. on a bipartisan basis and to advocate for public policy that aﬀects
our business in compliance with all applicable laws.
Providing ﬁnancial support to responsible pro-business candidates is an important
means by which we improve the business climate, our quality of life, and the society
in which we live, enabling us to succeed as a company committed to integrity,
innovation, and value creation. Our engagement sometimes includes direct ﬁnancial
support of organizations and individuals on both sides, and it's intended to ensure
that PepsiCo's views are voiced and heard. Details on all of our political
contributions are posted on our website, pepsico.com, on an annual basis for
shareholders' review.
{BIO 22140116 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr.Chairman. We've received a question on -- in relation to pay ratio.
How does the Board justify the CEO pay ratio? Total compensation is up almost $3
million and even straight salary is up 6.6%. What did other employees get and in
particular, the median employee? Didn't they all contribute to the company's
success in 2022?
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Yeah. PepsiCo has maintained a strong pay-for-performance philosophy that ties the
vast majority of total compensation for our executive oﬃcers directly to the
company's performance. This helps to ensure the long-term success of the company,
our employees, and our shareholders. Across all our markets and employee groups,
PepsiCo remains committed to providing competitive compensation that is
appropriate for an employee's position and geographical location, while also linking
compensation to the company and individual performance. Please keep in mind that
the ratio reﬂects the breadth of our operations which includes a globally diverse
workforce with a large number of frontline employees, more than half of whom are
located outside of the U.S.
We continue to recognize the eﬀorts of our frontline associates, and in 2022, we
made investments to provide substantial wage increases to select sales, supply
chain, driver and warehouse positions in North America, as well as enhance our U.S.
hourly retirement programs.

Okay. Thank you for the question. We absolutely acknowledge our role as part of this
complex food system to oﬀer a range of products for our consumers, and we are
very proud of our progress to transform our portfolio that we started this journey
about 18 years ago. In September 2021, we introduced pep Positive, a strategic end-
to-end transformation with sustainability at the center of how the company will
create growth and value. We reinforced our plans to evolve our portfolio in that pep
Positive and improve its nutritional proﬁle and help improve nutrition access through
our pep Positive framework which includes incorporating more diverse ingredients
in both, new and existing foods to deliver nutritional beneﬁts such as chickpeas and
whole grains. Expanding our position in the nuts and seeds category, where we
already are the global branded leader, including leadership positions in Mexico,
China, and several Western European markets.
Accelerating progress against our goal to reduce added sugar and sodium by 2025,
to the use of science-based targets across all our portfolio, and cooking our food
oﬀerings with healthier oils, with reduction goals informed by leading global and
national health authorities, including WHO. And then partnering with communities to
advance food security, and make nutritious food accessible to 50 million people by
2030. We already engage in extensive reporting, speciﬁc to the goals on
approximately 80% of our global foods volume, and 90% of our global beverage
volume, sold annually, which audited and veriﬁed independently by partnership for a
Healthier America.
As you may know, independent groups such as Access to Nutrition Initiative also
assess our portfolio with their unique methodology and process, and they reported
30% healthier in the last global report and 28% healthier in their most recent U.S.
report. Currently, we want to continue to focus our resources on progressing on our
stated 2025 goals and beyond, and we remain accountable with our annual
