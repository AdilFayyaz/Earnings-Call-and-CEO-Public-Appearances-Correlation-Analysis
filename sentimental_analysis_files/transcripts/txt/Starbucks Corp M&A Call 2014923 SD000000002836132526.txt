this acquisition will be posted this afternoon on the investor relations website. With
that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Howard.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Thank you, JoAnn. This is an historic day, as we begin the process of acquiring full
ownership of Starbucks Japan.
In so many ways, the history of Starbucks International's business and global
footprint, which now extends to more than 21,000 stores in 65 countries, is tied to
our ﬁrst store in Japan. In the summer of 1996, I ﬂew to Japan to join our new joint
venture partner, Sazaby, to open our ﬁrst store in Tokyo's gleaming Ginza District. I
will never forget the lines around the block, that our very ﬁrst customers formed in
anticipation of their ﬁrst taste of our coﬀee and the unique Starbucks experience,
that until that day was limited to North America.
The importance of Japan to Starbucks in 1996 is even more impressive today,
because the foundation of all of our partnerships is based on the trust, conﬁdence,
transparency and friendship that we have built with Sazaby and our Starbucks Japan
partners. Our partnership began when Yuji San wrote me a handwritten note and
delivered it in person to my oﬃce, about his vision for Starbucks in Japan, a letter
which I still have. I am deeply grateful to Yuji San, Mori San. And (Jun) San, for their
vision, partnership and their leadership.
Their eﬀorts, along with the dedication and pride of tens of thousands of Starbucks
partners in Japan over the past two decades have established an admired brand.
And delivered the strong ﬁnancial results that have made Starbucks Japan a
meaningful contributor to Starbucks' growth and proﬁtability in our China and Asia
Paciﬁc segment. All of us here at Starbucks are extremely grateful for the bedrock of
values and loyalty that has been established with our partners and customers
throughout the country of Japan.
In the coming months, we will continue to build on the foundation of trust we have
achieved in Japan. We will continue to invest in our partners and enhance the
experience we provide our customers, to facilitate enhanced growth and
development. We will do this by staying true to our core values. And through the
lens of taking care of our people, delivering the highest quality coﬀee and
innovating in product store design. And the digital and mobile experience.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-23
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 11Troy AlsteadI'd like to thank our partners throughout Japan, who consistently have delivered the
Starbucks experience for our customers each and every day. Through their hard
work, passion and dedication they have helped to establish Starbucks as one of the
most trusted and admired brands in Japan. To all of them, I say thank you.
Now let me turn the call over to Troy, to speak about the speciﬁcs around the
transaction. Troy?
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Thanks, Howard. We are extremely excited about expanding our ownership in Japan
for many reasons. But there are two critically important points to underscore. First,
this transaction will be immediately accretive, starting FY15 on a non-GAAP basis,
when excluding a gain and certain expenses and amortization related to the
acquisition.
Second, we will be positioned to accelerate growth in a market that oﬀers
tremendous opportunity for us. With this acquisition, Japan will become our second-
largest market in terms of total annual retail store revenues, with approximately $1.2
billion in revenues. And the fourth largest market in terms of store count. We will
have approximately 25,000 partners. And we are excited to continue to build on
strong positive comps, which have averaged approximately 4% annually over the
past three years.
We believe this acquisition puts us in an even stronger position to elevate the
Starbucks experience for customers and partners. We will also create a variety of
growth opportunities to provide ﬁrst-year earnings accretion for shareholders on a
non-GAAP basis, which will also increase over time. I would like to take you through
a quick recap of what led to this decision. And then I will discuss the key aspects of
the transaction.
There were 1,051 Starbucks stores in Japan at the end of the Third Quarter, which
currently operate under a joint venture agreement between Starbucks and Sazaby.
Together, Starbucks and Sazaby introduced the coﬀeehouse experience to our
customers in Japan. And we are very proud of what we have accomplished together.
Sazaby has always recognized the importance of innovation and growth as key
drivers of our ability to elevate the Starbucks experience.
We also recognize that to continue to position itself for future success, the business
needs to keep pace with the dynamic nature of the Japanese market. Sazaby
decided to exit the business ahead of the expiration of their rights under the joint
venture agreement, in a manner that provides for a smooth and seamless transition
for customers, partners and shareholders.
Full ownership in this market is the right approach for the future. We know this
business deeply. And we have been involved in it at every turn, for nearly two
decades.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-23
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 11The Starbucks Japan leadership team is very strong and stable. They know our
brand, our business, our customers. And they have consistently and successfully
tailored product and services to local tastes. We also know them well. And we have
full conﬁdence in their future performance.
Relative to our global portfolio, store-level proﬁt margins in Japan are among the
highest in the world, driven by high transaction counts and average ticket. Our
business model in that market has been proven to be very resilient, even though
Japan has had periods of macroeconomic diﬃculty. In addition to strong ﬁnancial
results, Japan has provided lasting beneﬁts to the entire portfolio in a variety of
ways, from playing a key role in our global expansion, to being a center of
excellence for beverage innovation, store design. And an unparalleled store
experience.
This is a key market for us, in terms of strong brand loyalty, deep trust. And local
relevancy and presence. Our coﬀee leadership and expertise has an established
position in this market. You may recall that we opened our ﬁrst international
Starbucks Reserve store in Japan.
But what we are most excited about is that with full ownership, we will be able to
grow the business at a faster pace. And expand our business beyond our retail
stores. This acquisition also provides us the opportunity to leverage our existing
infrastructure and expand to multiple channels including CPG, licensing. And food
service. Further, Japan has one of the largest and most penetrated ready-to-drink
markets in the world. And today, our share in that market is a fraction of what it is in
the US.
Additionally, the Japanese tea market is well-established and mature, which plays
very well into our longer-term strategy for our Teavana brand. Tea is an important
component in the Japanese culture. And we are excited to bring the full breadth of
Teavana's premium teas and unique teahouse experience to our Japanese
customers over time.
Another area of opportunity is mobile, digital. And loyalty, as we have yet to fully
unleash the capabilities and breadth of our social, digital. And loyalty access in this
market. With the deep customer loyalty this unique market has developed its own
approach to this space, catering to local preferences. And we are very excited to
build on that. We will be also able to leverage best practices from our global supply
chain operations, research and development. And store development.
I'll now walk through key aspects of the transaction. Currently, Starbucks and Sazaby
each own approximately 39.5% of Starbucks Japan shares. And the remaining 21% is
held by public shareholders. This acquisition is structured as a two-step tender oﬀer
under Japanese law.
In the ﬁrst step, Sazaby will sell its entire 39.5% ownership to Starbucks, for
approximately $505 million. After the ﬁrst tender oﬀer step closes, we will ownFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-23
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 11Operator
Q - Jonathan W ingapproximately 79% of the outstanding shares of Starbucks Japan.
We will then launch the second step in the tender oﬀer to acquire all the remaining
outstanding shares. The price for the second step of the tender oﬀer is
approximately $409 million. Following the completion of the second step, any
remaining public shareholders will be cashed out at the second step price. Starbucks
will have full ownership of the business after remaining shareholders are cashed out.
In terms of the timing, we're expecting the ﬁrst step to be completed by the middle
of the First Quarter in FY15. And the ﬁnal step should be completed in the ﬁrst half of
calendar 2015. The majority of the funding for this transaction comes from our
substantial existing oﬀshore cash. And will result in minimal additional leverage. We
expect the transaction to be slightly accretive in the ﬁrst year, excluding a gain on the
acquisition, amortization of signiﬁcant acquired intangible assets. And acquisition-
related expenses. We expect this accretion to build over time.
We will discuss further details about the ﬁnancial impact of the transaction when we
report our Fourth Quarter and FY14 results in late October. As I mentioned earlier, we
are very excited about this acquisition, because of its immediate proﬁtability. And the
multiple opportunities for accelerated growth. This is the start of a new chapter in
our international growth strategy. And we look forward to sharing with you the
opportunities and progress as they unfold.
Echoing Howard, we are sincerely honored and grateful to Sazaby for their nearly
twenty-year partnership. I personally was part of the Starbucks International business
20 years ago, when we ﬁrst formed our partnership with Sazaby and established
Starbucks Japan. And I had the opportunity and honor to work directly with Yuji
Tsunoda and his team, as we laid the foundation to bring our ﬁrst store to Japan in
1996. Their contribution is enduring. And it will always be an integral part of the
Starbucks experience.
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Kyle?
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions)
Your ﬁrst question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Sanford C. Bernstein.
{BIO 17600921 <GO>}
This is Jonathan Wing in for Sara. Just a question about the dynamics of the coﬀee
market in Japan. Not typically conceived as a high-growth market. But maybe just
describe the opportunities. And see with them, how you think about prioritizingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-23

Q - Jeﬀrey Bernsteinthose. And again, in the context of does it change Starbucks' longer-term growth
algorithm? Thanks.
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
I think this is a good opportunity to ask John Culver, who is dialing in from Tokyo, to
take that question. John?
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Thanks, Jonathan. First oﬀ, the dynamics of the market are such that this is a very
large coﬀee market. And in particular, as it relates to brewed coﬀee. When you look
at the amount of brewed coﬀee we saw in our stores, it's some of the highest
amount of brewed coﬀee that we sell anywhere in the world, in line with what we see
in the US.
But beyond that is the fact that we have been able to build a footprint of over 1,000
stores, which is a national footprint, which next year we open our ﬁnal prefecture in
Japan. With that, we see opportunity to continue to grow the retail store footprint,
particularly around drive-through, which we feel is a big opportunity. We also feel
that there is a big opportunity to continue to accelerate the growth beyond the retail
stores and channels. So with the ready-to-drink business, where we only have a 2%
share of the RTD coﬀee business here.
Then also, beyond that, is to leverage our digital and mobile assets in Japan, to drive
customers both into our stores as well as into channels outside of our stores. For us,
we have been able to build a very respected and admired brand, the leading brand
in Japan. And we feel very positive about the opportunity to continue to leverage
that and grow well into the future here.
{BIO 17600921 <GO>}
Thanks.
Your next question comes from the line of Jeﬀrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is
open.
{BIO 7208345 <GO>}
Just actually two quick questions, one, I am wondering if you could just clarify, I think
you said no impact to FY14 results, modestly accreative to FY15. And I'm just
wondering whether that was incorporated in your initial guidance you provided in
July, to meet with the lower end of 15% to 20%? My main question was, if you could
just give some insight. And it has been very impressive, Japan's resilience despite
the challenging macro that you mentioned, I'm wondering if you give any current
update on those trends?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-23

Q - Brian BittnerI think you said 4% of the last three years in Japan on average. But has there been
any change in trajectory? It seems like a lot of your multi-national peers have talked
about signiﬁcant softness in those regions. And I'm just wondering if your Japan
business is holding up better than those. And to what you attribute that to? Thank
you.
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Thanks, Jeﬀ. I'll let Scott speak to the ﬁnancial question. And then John can address
the recent comp trends and how we might speak about that.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Any accretion from the Japan deal was not included in the guidance we gave last
quarter. So we'll update the FY15 guidance as we get into our call next month. John?
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Jeﬀrey, I think for us, what we have seen over the last 18 years that we've been
operating stores here, is that we have been able to navigate the macroeconomic
environment very well here in Japan, through both the ups and downs, on an
external basis. What we have delivered is a business model that, as I said, now
encompasses over 1,000 locations.
It has got some of the highest transactions anywhere in the world. It averages high
ticket for us, compared to other markets we operate in and when you look at the
store margins, the store margins are in that low 20% to 25% range.
For us, we feel that we are in a very good position to navigate any of the
macroeconomic uncertainties. And more importantly, we have used Japan to drive
innovation, both here in the market. But then also bring innovation from Japan on
our store designs and on product innovation into other markets that we operate in.
So Japan for us is a very strategic market. And as I said, our brand here is very strong
and healthy. And has become a much beloved brand from a customer and partner
perspective.
{BIO 7208345 <GO>}
Thank you.
The next question comes from the light of land of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer.
Your line is open.
{BIO 17258322 <GO>}
Congratulations. When you talk about the growth opportunity, can you just give us a
little bit more on the numbers side of that? How many stores you plan to open per
year over the next couple of years. And when you think about where you could get
to there in Japan, from the 1,000 you're at today, how do you think about that? ThenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-23

Operatorjust a second question is you talk about the restaurant level margins, which are
obviously very impressive, what does it look like on an EBIT margin basis? If you
could provide us any commentary on that, that would be helpful as well.
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Brian, in terms of speciﬁc growth targets for the next year or two, we're not going to
speak to those today. We will certainly talk more about that as we approach our
October earnings call. So we will give you a bit more details on both of your
questions, both how we think about growth going forward, as well as EBITDA
margins and otherwise, as appropriate. What I will say for today is just underscoring
what we said earlier.
This is a tremendous opportunity for us. We believe it will accelerate growth. With
more than 1,000 stores in Japan now, we are nowhere near done with the retail store
development.
But very importantly, this accelerates and opens up increased opportunity for us for
our portfolio of brands for other channel development in ways that we haven't even
begun to explore yet. So there's no question for us, this gives us an opportunity,
both on the store growth side of things. But also developing our brand more
meaningfully in Japan. And the impact again, to speciﬁc margins, we'll talk about we
get to the earnings call.
{BIO 17258322 <GO>}
Okay. And if I could just follow-up with one last quick one, is there any reason for the
big diﬀerence in the valuations attributable to both of the tranches that you're taking
out?
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Scott?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. If you look at the structure, we have obviously diﬀerent values for the Sazaby
piece. And for the public piece. When we look at those in total, we are very conﬁdent
that the value that Sazaby's getting, given their signiﬁcant stake and what they have
added to the business, plus what we're paying on the public shareholders, we think
all of the parties involved are getting a great value and a great deal. And we're really
happy with what that means for us for a total return basis, as we look forward. But it is
common and appropriate, given the ownership structure, for those values to be
done diﬀerently.
{BIO 17258322 <GO>}

Your next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh from Stephens.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Are you there, Will? While we're waiting I will add some thoughts with the issues of
growth. Obviously, of all the international markets I can think of, given our almost 20-
year history and the fact that we have been an owner of this market, although not a
majority owner, have been deeply, deeply, involved in a sense in co-managing and
being a steward of the brand with Sazaby for almost 20 years.
All during that time I think we have marveled at the high transaction count, as well as
the fact in every region we have opened in Japan, without exception, we have been
accepted, we have been relevant. And we have been successful. The analysis we
have done is that we are understored in that market given the high transactions and
the size and scale of the population. And the trust and aﬃnity with the brand.
Coupled with the fact that, as Troy mentioned in his remarks, of all the markets in the
world, the RTD, ready-to-drink, market and the vending market, speciﬁcally in Japan,
which really has kind of created an industry unto itself, we have not had the kind of
distribution. And certainly the 2% share, we think that is a de minimis number, given
the equity of the Starbucks brand.
The last thing I say is the number one retailer in Japan. And perhaps the most
respected person in all of retail in Japan is Mr. Yanai from Uniqlo. And when Uniqlo
was getting ready to open up their ﬂagship store in Manhattan on 54th and Fifth
Avenue, he came to this oﬃce and sat down with us. And said he wanted the honor
as a Japanese citizen coming to the US of having Starbucks in his store on Fifth
Avenue.
Given the fact that Uniqlo represents a global footprint around the world. And is a
fast-growing company in Japan, obviously. And we have no stores with Uniqlo in
Japan, that is just one single opportunity that I would highlight. I'm not overstating
the fact that we're going to be in every store. But it is a tremendous vote of
conﬁdence that someone like Mr. Yanai came to us and said, he wanted Starbucks in
his ﬂagship store in New York. And he is the number one Japanese retailer in that
country.

{BIO 6299571 <GO>}
Just a quick question for John. The multi-faceted, or the multi-channel approach in
the US has proven a really interesting competitive advantage. And you had
mentioned the CPG channel opportunity and licensing opportunities. Can you give
us an update on maybe where those businesses stand right now?
Do you have partners for those businesses right now? And maybe how you think
about that growth opportunity? Is a something when you can fully-own those
channels, or would it be a partner-style setup? Thanks.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Keith, this is John, thanks for the question. When you look outside of our retail stores,
we have a developing ready-to-drink business that we introduced back in 2005 and
2006 with our partnership with Suntory. We also have a partnership here on the
packaged coﬀee business down the aisle with Ajinomoto Foods.
We are very happy with both of those partnerships. We see a greater opportunity
now with this acquisition to bring one voice into the market and really look at our
customers and look at our consumers in a way that we speak to them cross channel
through our retail stores, as well as into channels outside of our stores.
We then feel that we can take our digital assets. And take the learnings that we have
had in the US around digital, around stars down the aisle. And bring those learnings
into Japan. And leverage those more directly with our customers in the market. And
through our business partnerships. We see tremendous upside in channels outside
of our stores, not only with ready-to-drink but also the packaged coﬀee. But then
when you look at licensed stores where we are underpenetrated, as well as the food
service business which is nonexistent today, we have what we feel is growth
opportunities for many years to come on the business here, beyond the retail
footprint.
