All right. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Tom Shaw, Vice President of Investor
Relations. On behalf of our leadership team and all the wonderful partners that helpFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 2 of 49contribute to today's event, I want to oﬃcially welcome you to Starbucks 2018
Investor Day.
As many of you experienced, we started our day with an exclusive ﬁrst look at our
New York Roastery, which we'll be oﬃcially opening to the public tomorrow. So
hopefully, those of you joining on the webcast will have the opportunity to visit the
store as well in the near future.
Before we begin the presentation, let me provide a few housekeeping items to help
guide you through the day.
Starting with the agenda. And we do appreciate a little bit of your patience today as
we had a slightly later start than we originally intended. We'll begin with a coﬀee
tasting, followed by presentations from Kevin Johnson; Roz Brewer; and John Culver.
From there, we will have a break until 4 p.m., which will include the opportunity to try
a variety of our latest beverage and food innovation in our lobby area outside.
We will conclude the formal presentations with our new CFO, Pat Grismer. And then
host a Q&A session with our leaders.
Finally, we will have a cocktail hour, lasting until approximately 6 p.m., to continue
the conversation with our team.
For those of you joining the webcast, you'll be able to follow the presentation online,
which also will be available for all of you to review following the conclusion of
today's event.
For those of you here today, if you haven't ﬁgured it out already, you could access
WiFi through the SBUX attendees network. And as you'll see, you should have
charging stations at each of your tables.
As always, please notify any of the IR team, including myself, if you got any questions
throughout the day.
Finally, let me pause a moment to review our safe harbor statement as we will be
making forward-looking statements throughout the day.
So as you know, we start many of these meetings at Starbucks with the coﬀee tasting.
So today, I'd like to introduce Michelle Burns, a 23-year partner with Starbucks, who
leads our coﬀee team. Her role includes sourcing some of the highest-quality arabica
beans around the world, C.A.F. E. Practices in support of our farmers, agronomy
research and Farmer Support Centers and proprietary roast curves that create the
Starbucks ﬂavor proﬁles that we all know and love.
So please welcome, Michelle Burns.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13

Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon. How's everyone doing? Good. Hopefully, you had a
great morning. As Tom mentioned, my name is Michelle Burns. And I have the
pleasure and the privilege to lead our global coﬀee team. I say privilege. I'm a 20-
year partner, 23 years. And I have grown my career here through many parts of the
business, retail, store development, operations. But today, I stand before you in a
very humble place, leading coﬀee in a dream come true.
People often ask me why have I been a part of Starbucks for 23 years. And when I
started, I started with the company that had a mission and a value and a sense of
purpose in this really great entrepreneurial spirit. I stand before you today and I have
those same feelings and that same excitement that this is a company that still shares
those mission and values that I do, still has an incredible sense of purpose and
probably, most important for me, for all of us, a core in coﬀee and a love for coﬀee.
So as has mentioned, we traditionally do a coﬀee tasting, just coming around for all
of you. And as I do that though, I wanted to share, if I could, a couple of things. One
is coﬀee is often referred to as the heartbeat of our brand. We source the highest-
quality arabica coﬀee from over 380,000 farms in 30 countries. We've been doing
this for a very long time. We largely source from very smallholder farmers. So if you
think about it, a farmer has less than 5 hectares, most often, where we are sourcing
our coﬀees, these farmers are depending upon us not just to pay the premiums for
the highest quality. But also to provide great technical tools and farmer support so
they can continue to grow the highest-quality coﬀees around the world.
I wanted to share one brief story with you, if I could, about a very recent experience
that I had in Colombia. I was in Colombia 3 weeks ago in a region in which we've
been working for over 30 years. And we spent the last two years working with the
team down there with young farmers and helping them with technical tools, laptops,
500 farmers on a test with laptops, some simple P&L management and a lot of the
technical skills of how to increase their productivity. As I sat around with these 5
young farmers between 17 and 22 years old, what they shared with me was what they
were looking for is the technical skills that we provide them and being there on the
farm through our agronomists to help them grow their future. The best quote I heard
was we've gone from a place where they saw themselves as coﬀee pickers, to
owners of coﬀee companies. It's just a very small example. But it shares, hopefully,
with you, the passion, the commitment of what we can do in a micro and scale it as a
company in all these regions around the world.
So with that, I'd like to do what we do best, what we normally do. I think, does
everyone have coﬀee? Looks like you do. Okay. Well today, we're going to celebrate
with Christmas Blend. Christmas Blend for us really speaks to heritage and tradition.
34 years in the making for this coﬀee. So from the time when roasted coﬀees coming
out of Pike Place, to where we sit today, I like it, a little music, the tradition continues.
This is still our largest coﬀee in a seasonal oﬀering by a landslide. So if you can
indulge me, take a sniﬀ and slurp. Indonesian coﬀee, really smooth blend, blended
with Central Americans. Then we have this unique piece of the Aged Sumatra, whichFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 49Kevin R. Johnsongives it, for any of you who are connoisseurs, a little bit of cedar-y ﬂavor. Almost a
peat-like, Scotch is often used for those of you that may see that in the ﬂavor proﬁle.
So it's really meticulously blended coﬀee.
But what I've just shared with you is, large coﬀee drinker or not, a part of the
experience and the tradition is the sense of place that it gives you. So my hope is
that this has just been a nice start to a great afternoon. As I said, I'm very proud to be
a part of this company, proud to welcome you. And I really wanted to share a bit of
our tradition. And thank you very much for being a part of wherever and wherever
this coﬀee may transport you in your holiday traditions. Thank you.

{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Well. Good afternoon. Welcome to the 2018 Starbucks Investor Conference here in
New York. How many of you had an opportunity to visit the Starbucks Reserve
Roastery this morning? Great. What did you think? Beautiful. Wonderful. Well I'm
glad you had that opportunity. And I'm glad you're here today.
We're delighted to spend the time with you this afternoon. And we have the entire
Starbucks leadership team here. We have many leaders, our leaders -- international
leaders from around the world. And Mike Ullman, the Chairman of Starbucks, is right
here, joining us today. So from Starbucks, to you, we welcome you here today.
Now my Starbucks journey began nearly a decade ago when I joined the Board of
Directors. It was in 2015 that I joined the management team as Chief Operating
Oﬃcer. And it's been now 18 months, roughly, in the role as CEO. And it continues to
be my honor to serve Starbucks, one of the world's most admired and trusted
brands.
The leadership team and I work in service each and every day of our partners, our
customers and you, our shareholders. Now the Starbucks journey is a special one. It
began 47 years ago, 1971. And over that period, has built this great brand. We have
tremendous consumer reach, serving 100 million customers a week, with the kind of
repeat frequency that is unheard of in the food and beverage industry.
Over the past two years, we've successfully made the transition from founder-led to
founder-inspired. And we have a world-class leadership team. And over the last 6
quarters since I've been CEO, I've been working with our leadership team to really
set the foundation and lead us to this next chapter of growth, a chapter that requires
us to have the wisdom to know what to honor and preserve from the past. But also
the courage to boldly reimagine our future.
The leadership team and I have worked together over this past year to lay the
foundation for the next chapter of growth that we call growth at scale. Now growth at
scale acknowledges 3 things. First, it acknowledges that Starbucks has grownFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 49signiﬁcantly over our 47-year journey, with 29,000 stores and FY '18 revenue of $24.7
billion. We are growing oﬀ of a large base. Number two, we acknowledge customer
behaviors are shifting rapidly, whether it's embracing the digital lifestyle, amplifying
the need state of convenience, a desire for more premium, personalized experiences
or a trend toward more healthy food and beverage choices. This strategy
acknowledges we must continue to adapt and adapt rapidly to meet our customers
where they are. And third, certainly, we acknowledge that the competitive landscape
is evolving as many others see a large and growing addressable market around all
things coﬀee, which requires us in the strategy to amplify our competitive
diﬀerentiators as we capture the next wave of growth.
Now what does growth at scale mean for shareholders? Well ﬁrst, it's about brand.
You're investing in one of the world's most admired and trusted consumer brands.
Second, this growth at scale strategy is about driving predictable, sustainable growth
and returns to shareholders. And ﬁnally, this is about a leadership team that is
executing with focus and discipline on creating that shareholder value.
Now what you're going to hear today, you're going to hear clear strategic priorities
that have been co-created by this leadership team. You're going to hear about the
detailed operating initiatives that are driving results. In fact, we saw progress in
virtually every operating metric that we track in Q4. And we continue to see evidence
that this strategy is working. You're going to hear about customer experience
evolution and innovation. And you're going to hear about how we are amplifying
competitive diﬀerentiators. But importantly, you're going to hear about the
foundation of building the brand consistent with our past and building that brand
that creates that emotional connection to the customers we serve. All of this adds to
the conﬁdence that our strategy is working and supporting the long-term growth
model.
Now growth at scale has 3 major building blocks. The ﬁrst is streamline, which is to
enable more focus on the core value drivers and more agility in our innovation
agenda. That focus then is applied to 3 strategic priorities that allow us to focus
management attention, our capital, our partner resources and execute with
discipline. Then ﬁnally, building and amplifying the Starbucks brand is about
continuing to expand our reach and amplify what makes Starbucks diﬀerent from all
other competitors.
Now I'm going to provide you the growth at scale framework today. And Roz and
John are going to take you through detailed initiatives around the strategic
priorities. Then later today, Pat is going to come up. And he's going outline the long-
term growth model that supports this growth at scale agenda.
Now we're conﬁdent in our approach simply because we have evidence of business
outcomes from the initiatives we're driving that are working.
Now we started our streamline eﬀorts roughly 6 quarters ago around 3 main
initiatives: retail market alignment; business simpliﬁcation; and Global CoﬀeeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 49Alliance. Retail market alignment is around leveraging the appropriate business
model to fuel growth and create value in each market. Business simpliﬁcation is
eliminating complexity so that Starbucks partners can spend more time creating and
delivering the Starbucks experience. The Global Coﬀee Alliance is around
expanding the Starbucks CPG presence in new geographies and on the Nespresso
platform.
We recently launched a fourth initiative to increase the velocity of innovation aligned
with those priorities.
Now let's take a look at the actions we've taken over the last six months in each one
of these areas. Let's start with retail market alignment.
Now as you're aware, we have transitioned many markets over the last 6 quarters to
licensed partners. Now keep in mind, we have long-term relationships with these
licensed partners who are experienced in building the Starbucks brand in other
markets. In fact, their understanding of the local market, their ability to deploy
capital, the operational excellence they bring, ensures that these markets will stay
true to the Starbucks brand. In addition, we deployed capital to acquire 100% of the
East China joint venture so that we could unify China Mainland, our fastest-growing
market, as a company-operated market. This is enabling us to accelerate growth in
China and maximize shareholder value creation.
Business simpliﬁcation. I believe in empowering my Starbucks partners so that they
can focus on the things that make Starbucks great, elevating the customer
experience in our stores. Now in many ways, scale and complexity can be barriers. To
focus on the most important things, we've simpliﬁed work, we've deployed
technology, for example, to automate administrative tasks, such as improving
scheduling in our stores for our partners and enhancing inventory management. It
frees up time performing administrative activity so they perform more of their time
on customer-focused activities.
Now we've taken many actions, including closing or divesting of noncore slow
growth businesses, simplifying how we work and leveraging technology. That is
allowing us to put more of our energy into what matters the most, the customer
experience.
Global Coﬀee Alliance. A little bit of background. We built a very powerful and
strong CPG and Foodservices business in the United States and Canada. And that
Foodservices business and CPG business has acted as a brand ampliﬁer to
customers who would visit our stores because they could -- simply, they could go
then at grocery or mass merchant and ﬁnd Starbucks-branded products to buy and
consume at home, amplifying the brand.
And the fact is, we're in 78 diﬀerent countries around the world. And in all -- most all
those other countries, CPG and Foodservices business was either nascent or
nonexistent. So we had 2 choices. We either go down the path and build CPG andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 49Foodservices organically over the next decade, or we ﬁnd a strategic partnership.
And NestlÃ© turned out to be the perfect strategic partnership. And we're very
excited about the ﬁrepower behind these 2 great brands. And it is a growth
opportunity. Single-serve platforms of Nespresso and Dolce Gusto will now be an
opportunity for Starbucks coﬀee on those formats. And NestlÃ© brings the global
reach of 5 million points of presence in 190 countries around the world. Together, we
share a common commitment, a commitment to support coﬀee farmers around the
world. This Global Coﬀee Alliance will be accretive in ﬁscal year '20. And this Global
Coﬀee Alliance will grow and pay dividends to Starbucks shareholders for years to
come.
Now the ﬁnal component of our streamline work has been around accelerating the
velocity of innovation, which really is based on 3 things we've been driving. Number
one is focusing our innovation agenda on the key priorities we've set for the
company. Focusing those innovation projects and resources on the things that
matter the most. The second is embracing more modern-day methodologies of
innovation, including things like human-centered design and working in smaller,
cross-functional teams. In fact, we have a mantra that says we want to go from idea to
action in 100 days. Small teams, 12 to 15 partners from diﬀerent functions, given a
mission and empowered.
To do this, we've reorganized the leadership to eliminate roles that had overlapping
mission so that we could accelerate decision-making. And we've reallocated
resources. This is about empowering smaller teams to drive these new ideas,
reducing the number of roles to get velocity. Now this will make us a more eﬃcient
company. But the primary objective is to accelerate the velocity of innovation.
Now this is creating energy within Starbucks, energy in how we innovate,
accelerating the velocity that is relevant to our customers, inspiring to our partners
and meaningful to our business.
Now streamline has enabled us to sharpen our focus and gain operating leverage to
drive progress against our 3 strategic priorities: number one, accelerate growth in
our targeted long-term growth markets, the U.S. and China; number two, expand the
global reach of the Starbucks brand through the Global Coﬀee Alliance; and number
three, increase returns to shareholders.
Now let's take a look at each of these strategic priorities. Now we've declared China
and the U.S. as our 2 targeted long-term growth markets. Why? Those 2 markets
represent a signiﬁcant opportunity for growth. The addressable market and the
growth of that addressable market in those 2 markets is our priority. The Starbucks
brand resonates with customers in both of those markets. But there are some unique
attributes of those 2 markets that's important to note. The stage of market
development is very diﬀerent in the 2 markets. In many ways, the consumer behavior
shifts are diﬀerent in those 2 markets. And in fact, the competitive dynamic is
diﬀerent in those 2 markets.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 49Market development stage. Growth in China will mainly come from new store
expansion and establishing the Starbucks brand experience in more places, in more
cities to capture a ﬁrst-mover advantage. Therefore, 80% of the growth in China is
going to come from new units versus same-store comparable. Now we'll balance the
2. But building out our ﬁrst-mover advantage in China is the priority.
Growth in the U.S. will be much more balanced between same-store comparable
and store expansion. Store expansion will be much more targeted, much more
targeted at the markets that are underpenetrated, such as the Sunbelt. And we'll
share more details on that with you today. So comp and new units is more balanced
in the U.S.
Let's talk about consumer behavior shifts. The Chinese consumer has embraced the
digital lifestyle far faster than any other market in the world. Data point: in China,
digital payments at Starbucks represents approximately 70% of total tender as
compared to 40% in the U.S. Social gifting in China has seen signiﬁcant growth.
Alibaba digital properties alone have more than 600 million users. In fact, Alibaba
and Starbucks share a common vision around what we call new retail, which is why
the China digital partnership is so important. In China, consumers have embraced
experiences around the need state of convenience far faster than other markets. This
is driving a wave of innovation around delivery, which is beginning to propagate to
other markets around the world.
Now we've rapidly implemented Starbucks Delivers in China and applied our
learning to begin implementation of Starbucks delivers in the United States. You're
going to hear more about that today.
And ﬁnally, on the consumer front, China is predominantly a tea-drinking culture.
Now we're introducing that tea-drinking culture to premium arabica coﬀee. And as
we introduce more customers to arabica coﬀee, we will see over time the
emergence of the daily ritual that exist today in the U.S. and Europe.
Now competitive landscape. Given the large and growing addressable market
around premium coﬀee, we're seeing more competition enter the market. It's to be
expected. In the U.S., there's been a wave of consolidation of food and beverage
brands. And we expect to see that continue. In China, there are many more startups
and a much more fragmented landscape of competition. And we expect to see that
as well.
Now there's no question that coﬀee is an attractive market. It's one of the fastest-
growing beverage categories globally.
Now this is data from Euromonitor, research data that shows the global specialty
coﬀee shop category, really, the core of our business, remains very healthy and is
growing at a 6% CAGR. In fact, over the last ﬁve years, 2012 to 2017, it grew to 6%
CAGR. And Starbucks outgrew the addressable market, taking share. The growth at
scale agenda is projecting with the Euromonitor that it's going to continue to grow atFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 49that rate. And we've laid the foundation for us to continue to grow faster than the
addressable market and take share.
Now I commented on the drivers behind the decision to establish the Global Coﬀee
Alliance with NestlÃ©. And with that alliance in place, we are now focused on
execution. 3 important points. This alliance is about growth, new markets, new
platforms. This alliance is a brand ampliﬁer. NestlÃ© brings 5 million points of
presence across 190 countries to highlight Starbucks-branded products at CPG and
Foodservices. And this partnership is aligned around a common set of values in
support of coﬀee farmers around the world.
NestlÃ©'s global reach and their knowledge of CPG and Foodservice business will
act as a catalyst for growth of Starbucks in these markets. Now John is going to take
you through all the details of how we're operationalizing the plan, the progress
we're making and the optimism we have for the path that we're on.
Strategic priority #3. Shareholder value creation. We're committed to return $25
billion of cash to shareholders over the years' ﬁscal '18 to '19 -- or '20. And streamline
is a key driver of this commitment. In fact, with streamline, we have freed up $8
billion of capital from the actions we've taken. We have redeployed approximately
$1.4 billion of that capital to acquire East China and unify China Mainland. In
addition, we've increased our leverage more in line with our current growth stage. In
ﬁscal year '18, we returned approximately $9 billion of cash to shareholders in the
form of dividends and buybacks. And with the after-tax proceeds from the NestlÃ©
Global Coﬀee Alliance transaction, we initiated an accelerated stock buyback of $5
billion on October 1.
Streamline has enabled us to return a signiﬁcant amount of capital to shareholders.
But that's only one aspect of this priority. Pat, this afternoon, is going to walk you
through our capital allocation approach that we're using as part of the growth at
scale agenda that ensures we fund necessary investments for the long-term success
of Starbucks, while at the same time creating an ongoing predictable way to think
about dividends and buybacks that are woven into our value-creation model.
Now the ﬁnal and perhaps the most important building block in our growth at scale
agenda is our focus on building the Starbucks brand and doing this while staying
true to our mission and values.
Now we reach out and we get a lot of feedback from customers on what makes
Starbucks special to them. And so let's just take a quick look at what they say.
(presentation)
So the foundation of our growth at scale agenda requires we stay true to the brand
promise that built this great company. We understand intuitively. But we also ask
customers why they choose Starbucks. And in the research, the comments and the
taxonomy of their feedback is consistent. It's 3 things: it's, number one, it's theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 10 of 49Starbucks experience we create in our stores; number two is the quality of our
coﬀee; and number three is our corporate reputation for doing good.
You look at the kind of comments that come back in the surveys in the research that
we do, the fact that our Starbucks partners in our stores make an eﬀort to connect
with customers, the service we deliver, the inviting atmosphere. It's about the quality
of our coﬀee, everything from how we source it to how we roast it, to how we create
personal handcrafted beverages. And it's about the pursuit of doing good, the fact
that we are a company that takes care of our Starbucks partners and commits to
serving the communities in which we operate.
Now these 3 attributes are captured so elegantly in our mission statement. They
dominate the way we build Starbucks, the Starbucks brand, through the customer
experience we deliver in our store.
Now how do we know when we're delivering the Starbucks experience? For each of
us, we can close our eyes and imagine that perfect Starbucks experience for us.
Perhaps when you open the door and walk in the store, the aroma of coﬀee, the
music, the familiar faces you see in the store, the perfect handcrafted beverage.
Perhaps, you're on your way to work and you've issued a Mobile Order and Pay. And
there is your order prepared for you, hot and ready for you to grab and move on
with your next activity.
The Starbucks experience really begins by ensuring that we create the right
environment in our stores, the location, the design aesthetic, the aroma, the
welcoming environment. But our research conﬁrms something that we always knew
intuitively. And that is the role of the Starbucks partners who proudly wear the green
apron. They are the ones that create the special Starbucks experience. Enabling our
partners to practice their craft of personalizing handcrafted beverages for each and
every customer, inspiring our partners around a mission that is bigger than any one
of us, investing in our partners in support of their dreams and aspirations, the
experience we create in our stores is the result of the investments we make in our
partners in both wage and beneﬁts.
Now we've long been recognized as a company that takes care of our partners by
providing meaningful, culturally relevant beneﬁts for part-time workers of 20 hours
or more a week. Let me give you 2 examples of how this is a diﬀerentiator. In the U.S.
today, we now have over 12,000 U.S. Starbucks partners participating in the
Starbucks College Achievement Plan and Pathways to Admission programs with
ASU, partners that are on their way to earn a 4-year college degree and graduate
debt-free.
In Starbucks China, our Starbucks China partners consistently expressed an
aspiration around caring for their parents as they age. We worked to create a new
critical illness insurance program for Starbucks partner parents to address
catastrophic health care incidents that they may encounter. These are 2 examples
about how we take care of partners because we know if we take care of StarbucksFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 11 of 49partners, they take care of customers. Data shows that our retention rates are 15 to
20 points higher than industry averages for food and beverage. When we take care
of our partners, they take care of our customers.
Quality of coﬀee. Now once customers visit Starbucks, they quickly realize that we
serve the highest-quality arabica coﬀee roasted to create a unique ﬂavor proﬁle that
Starbucks has perfected over a 47-year period. 3 ways that are key diﬀerentiators for
us. The fact that we source our own coﬀee, green coﬀee, from over 380,000 coﬀee
farmers that we've had relationships with around the world for the last 47 years and
stay true to the C.A.F. E. Practices to ensure that there's transparency and that the
money that we pay for that coﬀee goes to those coﬀee farmers, that allows us to
have access to the world's ﬁnest coﬀee. We buy our own coﬀee. Our coﬀee-buying
team, under Michelle's leadership, they know where to ﬁnd the best coﬀee and how
to buy the best coﬀee and ensure that Starbucks serves the world's highest-quality
arabica coﬀee.
Number two, the way we roast our coﬀee. Now we roast our own coﬀee to a set of
what is called roast curves. Roast curves have been perfected over 47 years. These
roast curves are the relationship between time and temperature that creates the
unique ﬂavors in our coﬀee. These roast curves are proprietary to Starbucks. And
we've developed them and perfected them over a 47-year period.
And when those roasted coﬀee beans reach our stores, we then create personalized
handcrafted beverages for each and every customer. Everything from how we
source, the roast curves and the fact that we personalize each beverage for our
customers are diﬀerentiators for the Starbucks Coﬀee Company.
But the third and ﬁnal element of the brand alchemy is our commitment to doing
good. Research would show that 60% of consumers are belief-driven buyers. They
see brands like Starbucks as a force for change. And we have organized our social
impact agenda around 3 pillars: sustainability; opportunity; and community.
Sustainability starts with making coﬀee the ﬁrst sustainable agricultural product to
the sustainability of the -- serving that coﬀee, strawless lids, recyclable cups,
sustainability of our stores. And we just recently launched a greener apron program
around sustainability of how we operate in our stores.
Opportunity is about hiring from diverse populations that make us better, like
veterans and military spouses or opportunity youth. It's about creating opportunity
for those partners once they join Starbucks through the Starbucks College
Achievement Plan.
And the third pillar around community is ensuring that we're doing things that are
important in those communities, the day of service, the month of service. The fact
that we're doing FoodShare in the United States is an example, or helping with the
unsheltered families in Seattle and FoodShare across the country, those are all
examples.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 12 of 49Now we're going to remain committed to the pursuit of doing good, not only for our
partners. But pursuit of doing good in the communities that Starbucks is a part of.
You put that all together, we build the brand every day when the customer comes
into our store. We build that brand through customer experience and customer
engagement. We then serve the world's ﬁnest coﬀee. And we stay true to who we
are, the pursuit of doing good. We then amplify the brand in 3 unique ways.
In fact, the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries is one example of how we amplify the
brand, with the ultimate experience around all things coﬀee. You think about the
iconic representation of the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries in Seattle, Shanghai, Milan
and now New York. Shanghai opened a year ago. The Shanghai Roastery opened a
year ago. And since then, we've seen over 1 million customer occasions to the
Shanghai Roastery. And just last Saturday, in the Milan Roastery that's been open less
than 90 days, this video was taken of the line outside of the store that wraps down
around the building and behind the building of customers waiting to visit the iconic
Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Milan. These are examples of brand ampliﬁers. We
have 2 more Roasteries that are in the pipeline. Tokyo will open in February of 2019.
And Chicago Starbucks Reserve Roastery will open in later calendar year '19.
Now amplifying the Starbucks brand also happens through the Global Coﬀee
Alliance with NestlÃ©. We know for a fact that customers come to Starbucks, they
develop a ﬂavor preference for our coﬀee, create relationships with our partners in
the stores. For them to then, down the aisle or at other Foodservices locations, see
Starbucks-branded products, it ampliﬁes the brand. And third, we amplify the
Starbucks brand through the digital engagement we have with customers. Now that
digital engagement has grown not only in the U.S., with active Rewards customers.
But also digitally registered customers in the U.S. And we're going to share a bit
more about how we're continuing to expand that. But it's also signiﬁcantly expanded
in China through our relationship with Alibaba. And we'll share some news with you
on some of the new things that are unfolding in that China digital partnership with
Alibaba.
So by the end of today, it's our aspiration that we have reaﬃrmed why Starbucks is
one of the most attractive investments in consumer brands. Predictable, sustainable
growth strategy, the strength of the Starbucks brand globally, the fact that we are
growing faster than a large and growing addressable market. And there's clarity of
our strategic pillars, what diﬀerentiates us. And a road map ahead.
Now for those who look to invest in consumer-focused brands, we believe this is one
of the strongest brands in one of the fastest-growing categories, coﬀee, with a clear
strategy. And we have evidence that our strategy is working, not only in Q4. But as
we look -- as we go forward, we continue to see evidence that the initiatives we've
chosen, the energy we're putting behind them, is moving the needle.
And so with that, I thank you for being here today. And it's time to now take a look at
more of the details behind our growth at scale agenda. Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13

So what you just saw is happening each and every day around our stores, not only in
the U.S.. But all around the world. And we've been capturing these conversations
around coﬀee. And you'll see us show some more work in this area just like we did
with our series around Upstanders because this is who we are as a company.
So ﬁrst of all, thanks for being here this afternoon and spending some time with us.
This is my ﬁrst Investors Day. And actually, I'm just completing my ﬁrst year with the
company. And it's pretty exciting. It's been a really busy year this year. But looking
back, I want to talk a little bit about my decision to join Starbucks.
When I think about it, it was actually more of a calling than accepting my next new
role. It started the moment when I met Howard Schultz. I had a chance to interview
him at a leadership meeting at Wal-Mart Stores. So our lives collided. And through
Howard, I got a really good sense of the history of the company, the heritage of
coﬀee and true entrepreneurship. Then quickly, Howard introduced me to members
of the board. And shortly after that, I joined the board. Then I got a chance to meet
the members of management. And I experienced Kevin's leadership as he took the
helm as the new CEO of Starbucks Coﬀee Company. And I was hooked. And I've
been hooked ever since. And along the journey is something really interesting has
happened. I've fallen in love with the company. And it's sort of like the way you do
when something just hits you right in your gut and you feel good about the work
you're doing and you feel good about the mission and you get excited about the
challenge.
So it's been exciting to be here. And since the very beginning, Starbucks has shown
me and everyone else that you can serve your shareholders, you can support your
employees -- and our employees, who we call partners. And we can make a positive
impact. And all of that can be achieved in unison. And that's a rare ﬁnd. So for me is
what it means to work with a purpose and live out your values each and every day.
And I get that opportunity here at Starbucks. So thank you for listening for just a
minute to get a background in terms of why I'm here.
But before I get too far, I want to share with you a little bit about ﬁscal year '18. I want
to get us grounded in terms of the results that happened last year. And it was a year
of learning. Last year, total U.S. sales were up 7% to deliver $15.3 billion in sales, with
the biggest driver being our new noncomp stores. We opened 676 new stores,
which expanded our drive-through operations to 339 locations. And our
membership in Starbucks Rewards increased 15% year-over-year to 15.3 million
members. Our customer connection scores, they gained momentum, showing year-
over-year improvement across each and every daypart. And our full year comp
growth was 2%. And although that's lower than previous years, I believe the
initiatives that I will discuss with you this afternoon will help you see how we will
sustain the momentum we saw in Q4.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 14 of 49So at the same time in ﬁscal year '18 when we continue to see this momentum, we
began to build on our rich heritage around our partners. And around the time of our
IPO many years ago, we turned our employees into partners. And we did that by
extending stock options and a 401(k) program. We provided access to health care
beneﬁts 20 years before the ACA, the Aﬀordable Healthcare Act. And later, we
extended 100% tuition to our partners. And we pay sick time to our eligible U.S.
workforce. We know our partners are a critical component to our growth. The power
of connection and the power of the experience that they have in our stores is critical
to our growth. And today, our industry-leading Rewards program is 3x the value of
comparable retailers in the space. And it's our key lever for attracting and retaining
our top talent in our stores.
So equally important to these investments, because these investments really pay oﬀ
for us, they pay oﬀ for our partners and they pay oﬀ for the business. So we've hired
more than 20,000 veterans and military spouses in the past ﬁve years. And we've
opened over 50 military family stores across 25 states. These are places where
veterans and military families can come and connect. They're also stores that
outperform across the entire portfolio.
So as Kevin mentioned, we have more than 12,000 partners participating in the
Starbucks College Achievement Plan. These individuals stay 50% longer. And they're
promoted nearly 3x at the rate of their peers. Our customer, Susan, said it best in the
video. Not only does she have the money. But the money that she has, she's going to
spend it with companies who do the right thing. So we're very proud of our front-
ended look, our front fast-forward look in our partners and the returns that we're
seeing as a result.
Now it's true that these investments, along with ongoing technology spend and the
shift in our product mix, has resulted in a decrease in operating margin for ﬁscal year
'18. And this highlights why our focus on operational eﬃciencies and discipline is key
to our success in the future.
To help us get there, we've made signiﬁcant foundational changes around
developing a clear understanding of today's consumer and how we can quickly
adapt to meet their changing needs because they are changing. So we've become
much more sophisticated users of consumer insights. And we're using data to
identify how to drive transactions and improve performance overall.
Let me share a few examples with you. As Kevin mentioned, the health of our brand
is strong. Fortune included us in its top 10 list of most admired companies 7 out of
the last 10 years. Consumers, they have a strong love for our brand. We lead in
awareness. We lead in consideration and ﬁrst choice, with a large margin in ﬁrst
choice. And we're well positioned with millennials and centennials.
You also heard Kevin reference the size and growth of the specialty coﬀee market. In
the U.S. alone, we see similar stats, with specialty coﬀee growing historically at about
7%. But Starbucks is growing at about 9%, ahead of the market. That market isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 15 of 49comprised of more than 180 million people, adults, engaging in away-from-home
coﬀee and tea at least once a month, with 40% of those coming to Starbucks
monthly. All of this underlines why our work this year will focus on 3 initiatives. And
this will continue to help us elevate the customer experience and improve
operational excellence. You've likely heard me talk about this in Third Quarter
earnings and Fourth Quarter earnings. And those 3 are: enhancing our in-store
experience; secondly, delivering beverage innovation; and third, driving digital
relationships. I'll walk you through some of these areas and give you some details
and talk to you about the progress we're making in each.
So ﬁrst of all, enhancing the in-store experience. Our customers, they come to us for
the best coﬀee. But they stay in our cafÃ©s for the best moments that we create. And
some of the best moments come from the little things that happen in our cafÃ©s.
But we haven't always made it easy for our partners to slow down for a second, look
our customers in the eye, make that connection and keep them coming back each
and every time.
We have really bombarded our partners with complex tasks. We've given them
unclear expectations. And those things often get in the way of them doing the best
job and leading with their customer connection. So this is why it's important to really
understand how our partners work in the stores, what is the work that they have to
do. We need to understand this so we can make their jobs easier and make their
jobs more enjoyable. And we do that by freeing up more time for them to engage.
A recent assessment that we conducted found that more than 25 of the 65 people
hours scheduled each day are spent on noncustomer-facing task. Partners also, they
step away from our customers up to 22 times an hour. And that's during peak. And
they do that to replenish their stations. Overall, our partners spend 40% of their time
on nonfacing-customer tasks. So to shift this balance, we're resetting task
management and data-driven inventory management with the goal of improving
capacity and throughput so partners have more time to spend with customers.
One of the ﬁrst steps that we've taken is shifting the cleaning task to later in the day
to after closing. And partners are calling it clean play. It's been a huge hit. They're
excited about it. And I want you to take a look at something.
(presentation)
I especially love Haley's comment about her customer connection scores really
making her building see a real boost in her performance. Now it's real early in this
process for us. But we are consistently hearing these comments back from our
partners. And it's translating into incremental lift across the portfolio.
So our partners, they're also active in our internal social channel where they give us
feedback on best practices. It's a great way for us that are in the support center in
Seattle to really learn real time what's happening and what they're experiencing
every day. And shifting these very critical cleaning hours to later in the day has had aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 16 of 49very positive impact on who they are as a partner and how they interact with the
customers.
The second thing we're doing is deploying technology to automate product
planning and product replenishment and to track inventory in near real time. This
allows us to do several things. First of all, we eliminate the clutter, the clutter in the
back room and the clutter behind the bar. This will allow us to reduce our inventory
quantities and then eliminate the need for partners to move away from their stations.
It's really exciting to see how this impacts even some of the work we're doing around
our new store renovations. In terms of new store renovations and optimizing our real
estate portfolio, it's really important about the work we do to support the customer
experience as well. We have targeted a 2-year renovation strategy. This 2-year
renovation strategy will uplift our stores in a couple of ways. First of all, it'll allow us
to put our equipment innovation in place. It'll raise our decor. And it'll allow us to
introduce new format changes. In that period, we anticipate we'll reach about 1/3 of
the portfolio with newness. And this plan ﬁts squarely within the ﬁscal year '19 capital
guidance that you all have learned about. And we look to reach even more stores at
a lower average cost in the renovation model.
Our renovation approach also calls for implementing format changes to meet the
increasing demand for the need state of convenience. And you can see how it's
inﬂuencing our mix. In the last two years, the sales mix of both drive-through and
Mobile Order & Pay combined have increased by 10%. Mobile Order & Pay
continues to excel. And as it grows, we're continuing to evolve our early express
store formats to include the newest digital innovations. Those 2 combined really
address the need state of convenience. So we're prioritizing projects that drive the
strongest ROI by leveraging data from historical renovations and on our store
performance with sales trends and consumer patterns.
These modiﬁcations will create a higher ﬁnancial return and help partners by
enabling more capacity and by improving eﬃciencies. So there's also a signiﬁcant
opportunity to expand our portfolio in underpenetrated areas. So take a look at this
heat map. The areas you see in the blue are the biggest opportunity given both
population per company-operated store. They're also where we have more
opportunity for drive-through locations. Drive-through overall has performed very
well in the past several quarters, outpacing our traditional cafÃ© comp by more than
4%.
And as we shared before, the majority of our store openings this ﬁscal will focus on
drive-through, represented in more than half of our U.S. company-operated stores.
Now in locations where drive-through isn't infeasible, we're continuing to innovate
and test platforms like delivery. So as you know, we've been running an Uber Eats
pilot in Miami. And it's receiving high remarks. I want you to take a look.
(presentation)FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 17 of 49So that's why I'm thrilled to announce today that we're bringing Starbucks Delivers in
partnership with Uber Eats to nearly a quarter of our U.S. company-operated stores
by the end of Q2 this year. It's an exciting move. It'll bring meaningful and scalable
growth to the U.S. operations. And we're making it easy for our partners by
integrating the ordering and technology directly into our systems. And this is
eliminating additional steps for our baristas and creating the fourth channel in our
stores, walk-in cafÃ©, ﬁrst channel; second channel, Mobile Order and Pay; third
channel is drive-through; and a new channel, Starbucks Delivers.
So our second initiative is delivering beverage innovation. Now espresso continues
to be our #1 driver of revenue in margin. We're also seeing incredible growth in our
cold coﬀee platform. And that includes our iced espresso, our cold brew and our
Starbucks Refreshers, which combined have contributed to more than 80% of our
beverage growth over the last two years.
In contrast to Frappuccino, these categories are more habitual and create more
brand aﬃnity. As you know, our primary softness has been centered around
Frappuccino. The customers who come to us for these occasions, they tend to have
less brand aﬃnity. And their frequency in these categories is relatively low, meaning
they're not your regular beverage routines.
So while the rotation from Frappuccino to other categories has been challenging for
us in the short run, due in part to the higher price point, the longer-term beneﬁt is
really compelling. And so we're innovating in categories now that create the most
brand aﬃnity for Starbucks. It provides us consistent routines and customer value
over time. And Nitro is a great example.
One of the big deliverables this ﬁscal is to expand Nitro from the current 2,500
stores to all remaining company-operated stores in the U.S. And what I love most
about this is a little bit of the theater that this really provides when you walk into a
Starbucks store, just seeing the levers getting pulled, the taps getting pulled on
Nitro. It's really nice to see. It's a real experience that diﬀerentiates us from our coﬀee
fast competitors. And we're seeing strong performance with incrementality. And it's
a more habitual product that's growing in popularity.
And we're continuing to innovate from our core, testing and learning from our
customers to quickly bring new beverages to market. For example, this summer, we
trialed a few new drinks in Nashville, Tennessee, our summer's macchiato, it's
extraordinary.
So we have some of our New York partners coming in to help us pass out the
beverage. I'd like to welcome them and thank them for all their hard work. And I get
to have one, too. Thank you. So much. It's really good. So as you all are getting your
drink -- it's a nice beverage. So this beverage, it really builds on our growth in iced
espresso and core macchiato, about $1 billion platform for us. It's a really beautiful
drink. It features smooth, cold-pressed espresso, our core, velvety spice meringue in
a cold foam, no whip cream, dusted with winter spices. When you sip it, just take aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 18 of 49second, let it just sit on your tongue for a second. And it's really great, really
refreshing. I think everybody enjoyed that. So this drink is inspiring our new cloud
macchiato and other ingredients that are launching this spring. It's a great example
of how we're combining our core of forward-looking coﬀee and innovation with
customer insights. We know our customers are loving the cold platform. It allows us
to develop authentic, original beverages that keep our customers coming back time
and time again. So I want to thank the partners who helped us do this little coﬀee
tasting here.
So now I don't want you to think we've taken our eye oﬀ the opportunity that exists
with food. We've talked to you all a lot about our food business. But we're pleased
with our recent traction. And we continue to see the ongoing strength of our
oﬀerings. We promised you that we would be accelerating our food over a 5-year
period, out through 2021 to get to a 25% balance of food in our portfolio. We're
currently at 22% of our food penetration in our business. But we are a beverage-ﬁrst
business. And our challenge and our opportunity is to drive transactions. And we
know, ﬁrst and foremost, that comes from our beverage oﬀering. And we need that
with more customers coming throughout the store each and every day.
So let me ground you in our third initiative. Our third initiative is driving digital
relationships. Our Starbucks Reward member, their growth accelerated to 15% last
quarter, helped in part by our ability to convert a portion of our 10 million registered
customers. And these are customers registered outside of the Rewards program.
Our spend per member has grown consistently the past three years. This is led by
our Mobile Order and Pay adoption and the quality of new members joining the
program, which we achieved through the better targeting work that our marketing
group is doing and also through more timely engagement.
For instance, our digitally engaged customers purchased a greater variety of
products, nearly 3x as many customers who don't even engage with us at -- in this
way at all as a Starbucks Rewards member. They're also more likely to purchase
products that have low awareness but high taste scores. So like Refreshers and Nitro
and Sous Vide Egg Bites, they usually grab that attention. But overall, we view digital
as an enabler. It enables us to be more convenient. It enables us to drive awareness.
And it drives value. And I'll break that down for you in real detail.
First of all, convenience. Convenience is tied to how customers are consuming today
and impacts how they interact with our stores. Shopping habits are changing, not
only in coﬀee cafÃ©s. But our customers expect us to provide a seamless
experience, much like what we're seeing in the omnichannel across all of retail. And
this is where delivery comes in. We drive awareness through our app and our e-mail
engagement and the cost of marketing to our customers through these channels is
extremely low.
Now I've previously mentioned we have just started to build relationships with
customers outside Starbucks Rewards. We see opportunity in ﬁscal year '20 and
beyond to drive incremental sales from this group as we develop and improve
marketing relationships with them and our capabilities around that work and to learnFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 19 of 49how they respond to us. So we expect to be a greater source for new SR members in
the future.
Today, we expect roughly about 1 to 2 points of comp growth to come from 3
drivers. First and foremost, our new member acquisition and the related spend lift
that we get from that. Second, that comp performance comes from Mobile Order
and Pay adoption and the routine that it drives. And thirdly, it comes from the
upcoming reward program enhancement that are coming this spring.
We're not including delivery in this estimate. But as I mentioned early, there's sizable
opportunity in that space. Now our Starbucks Rewards customers are really valuable.
We need to provide them value at the same time we're building additional
incentives for our nonmembers to drive acquisition. So starting this spring,
customers will have more choice and ﬂexibility in how they want to use their rewards.
They also will be able to begin redeeming their awards within 2 to 3 visits. And to
amplify these enhancements, we've designed a cross-platform campaign. And this
campaign will drive acquisition. It'll broaden our member base. And it'll expand our
Starbucks Rewards Gold members in a meaningful way.
So we've talked about innovation and some of the things we're going to do to make
the business stronger. But I think it's important that we talk about how we're
improving our operating margin and creating capacity in our P&L. And there are 5
key areas that I'll touch on. First of all, Kevin talked about the ways of working.
Smaller groups working on fewer, more critical priorities. And that enables us to
move with speed and deliver the innovation with acceleration.
Our supply chain. Our supply chain remains focused on building a network that
enables eﬃcient, reliable speed and speed to market for the new products that you
just saw me talk about.
Our labor eﬃciency. Our labor eﬃciency is focused on automation and improving
throughput and eﬀectiveness considering our barista's time in the cafÃ©s.
Our eﬀorts around front and back of the house and how it's organized depends on
the autoplanning and replenishment that helps us with waste reduction. And we're
continuing to evaluate our portfolio of products. You recall sometime last year, we
did pretty signiﬁcant work on SKU rationalization to simplify our lobbies to be less
cluttered and to improve the shopability of our cafÃ©s.
So to sum it up, our focus on improving stores, adding critical capabilities,
deepening relationships with customers remains consistent and is beginning to
show traction.
Our progress in the past few months has required a lot of heavy-lifting behind the
scenes, including studying how our partners work in the stores, identifying these
through our priorities. And then learning how to work in new ways. This combinationFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 20 of 49John Culveris allowing us to unlock the innovation and speed. And our focus now is to
accelerate. We have to accelerate in each one of these areas.
I'll leave you with these key messages. It's all about the customer. The customer is at
the center of all of our decision-making. There's momentum in the business. And we
saw it in the Fourth Quarter. We have plenty of room to grow our U.S. footprint.
We're doing it in a disciplined manner. And we're executing with speed.
I want to thank you for your time. I look forward to questions during Q&A. And right
now, I'll turn it over to John Culver.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Well thank you, Roz. Good afternoon, everybody. And it's so great to be back in New
York and appreciate everybody being here today as well.
I'm here today to share with you the tremendous opportunity that we have and we
see for our business in China and with the Global Coﬀee Alliance with NestlÃ©. But
before I get started, I wanted to share a little bit about myself and how my
experience at Starbucks positions me to lead Starbucks' next phase of growth across
our international business and our channel development businesses.
I joined the company 16 years ago as part of what is now our channel development
business, leading our foodservice organization. And over the last 12 years, I have had
the opportunity to lead the growth and the expansion of our international business
around the world. Today's Starbucks stores are present in 78 markets. And our
international store portfolio represents more than 50% of the total Starbucks store
portfolio, with China being the second largest market we operate in.
I often get asked when I travel and talk to people, "What has enabled Starbucks to
be so successful across all these diverse markets?" And I've seen this play out time
and time again. And the answer is quite simple. It's our culture, it's our values, the
fact that they know no borders. And more importantly, it is the way our partners
bring them to life and the emotional connection that this creates for them to be part
of something bigger than themselves.
Take a look at this short video.
(presentation)
That is a great video. And I hope you can see ﬁrsthand really the passion and pride
that our partners have for the company and the positive impact that we, as a
company, have for them and their families.
The true diﬀerentiators for Starbucks has been and will always continue to be our
passionate partners, the heritage we have around sourcing, roasting and serving the
highest quality coﬀee and the unique experience our partners bring to life for ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 21 of 49customers each and every day. There is absolutely no other company at our size and
scale that is able to replicate what we do.
Now as I -- as Kevin shared earlier, he has been very clear in what the strategic
priorities are for the company. And he's laid those out for all of us, not just the
leadership team. But down throughout the organization. Two of those priorities,
China and the Global Coﬀee Alliance, are the areas that I want to talk about.
Let me ﬁrst start with China. Today, in China, we operate more than 3,600 stores
across more than 150 cities, serving more than 7 million customers each and every
week. And as a matter of fact, in January, we celebrate our 20th anniversary in what
has become Starbucks' second home market.
Now I know many of you in the room were with us in Shanghai in May, where we
shared our purpose-driven growth agenda and our vision for the business going
forward. And I want to take this opportunity and give you an update on the progress
that we've made since the time we've met.
The growth agenda is centered around our partners and our goal of building a
diﬀerent type of company in China for China. It delivers a sharper focus on the third
place experience in our stores, the fourth place opportunity we see with digital and
the tremendous white space that exists to reach our customers at home and away
from home.
Let's start with the third place, our retail stores. In 2018, we opened 585 stores.
Beginning this year, we're committed to accelerating to opening 600 stores per year.
And over the next four years, we will grow to over 6,000 stores across 230 cities. This
acceleration allows us to gain ﬁrst-mover advantage. And it also positions us to
capture the opportunity that we see. And especially coﬀee market that is expected to
grow nearly 50% in the next four years.
Now equally important is the fact that our new stores' proﬁtability, ROI continues to
deliver best-in-class results. Whether you're in a top-tier city or a lower-tier city, we
are generating very, very healthy returns.
So let's take it, economics. First-mover advantage, growth of the coﬀee market, the
strength of our Starbucks brand. Combined, all 4 of these gives us great conﬁdence
that our strategy to continue to aggressively grow is the right one.
This slide here gives you a view of the top 13 cities in the country. These cities have
an addressable population of 152 million people, nearly half the U.S. This chart also
shows that we have plenty of room to grow our store base for a very long time.
Over the next four years, 60% of our new stores will be built in these cities. And as
we expand, we'll expand based on 3 key factors: ﬁrst is the opportunity we see for
ﬁrst-mover advantage to reach more customers; second is being able to captureFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 22 of 49prime real estate based on our development and market plans; and third, being able
to rapidly develop new store formats to ﬁt our customers' needs and the emerging
trends that we're seeing.
Now as we grow, there are 2 important metrics that we will watch closely. First is total
revenue growth for the market. This is important because, as Kevin highlighted, 80%
of our revenue growth is driven by new stores and roughly 20% by comparable store
sales. Second, we're focused on growing total transactions across the market. And as
I shared on our most recent earnings call, our total transaction growth delivered
double digit.
Now as we expand, we will also watch very closely sales transfer. And I know this has
been brought up before by this group. Our assumptions are that as we open our
new stores over the next four years, we will manage sales transfer at the historical
levels we have seen in the market.
These pictures are another proof point to the power and the relevance of our brand
in China. This shows the excitement and the anticipation that customers have when
we open our stores. Starbucks is absolutely a beloved company in China. And we
have built our business over the last 20 years. And in doing so in a way that elevates
the company in the eyes of our partners as well as the eyes of our customers.
And the greatest expression of our ability to lead around all things coﬀee in China is
the Shanghai Roastery. The Roastery is an immersive retail experience unlike any
other, committed to delivering a unique coﬀee experience that further educates and
excites our customers.
Just last week, as Kevin shared, we celebrated our one-year anniversary at the
Roastery opening. And I can tell you what an incredible year it has been. Over 1
million customers have walked through the doors. The Roastery has quickly become
the top destination for those who live in Shanghai as well as for those who visit.
These pictures that you see here and the ones that I shared earlier speak to the pent-
up demand and the opportunity we have to continue to lead the growth of the
coﬀee culture in China for many years to come.
When you couple that with the fact that per capita coﬀee consumption is less than 1
cup per year compared to 300 cups in the U.S., again, there is no other company
better positioned to capture this opportunity.
Now let me take a moment and talk brieﬂy about the environment in China. While
there has been much written about the rapid growth of competitors, Starbucks
remains focused on our strategy and the long-term opportunity we see for the
market. We respect all competitors. And we feel that we are positioned to navigate
any of the ﬂuctuations that take place over time in what is a rapidly changing
economic and competitive environment. We are positioned to win.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13

Page 23 of 49Now our conﬁdence in this comes from, again, those true diﬀerentiators: it's the
quality of our coﬀee; it's the unique third place experience; and it's the emotional
connection that our partners have built with our customers across all our stores.
Let me now shift and talk a little bit about the fourth place and the digital future in
China. In early August, we announced our most signiﬁcant digital partnership in
China with Alibaba. In early August -- I'm sorry, the partnership itself encompasses
the entire Alibaba ecosystem, including Ele.me, Hema, Tmall, Taobao and Alipay. The
partnership itself enables delivery, order fulﬁllment, membership integration and a
new virtual store platform. Together, Starbucks and Alibaba will create a seamless
and even more personalized experience oﬀ-line and online that will completely
transform the digital reach for Starbucks in the market.
Let me talk a little bit about delivery. Starbucks Delivers is not an ordinary delivery
program. The program reﬂects discussions that started between both our companies
more than a year ago. And what emerged is a unique, customized delivery
experience that was meticulously designed with our customers in mind each and
every step of the way.
Let me share a little bit more detail on some of the experience around Starbucks
Delivers. First, we've developed beverages speciﬁcally designed for delivery.
Second, we've created specially designed spill-proof lids for hot and cold
beverages. We've created tamperproof packaging seals to help ensure quality and
safety. And we've designed unique delivery containers to ensure orders will remain
hot or cold regardless of the item ordered.
Now as a consumer, you have the ability to order through either your Starbucks,
Ele.me or other Alibaba apps. As you order, you have the opportunity to customize
and personalize your favorite beverage. And once you order, your order will be
routed to the best store to fulﬁll it based on a unique fulﬁllment algorithm that has
been speciﬁcally designed with Alibaba for Starbucks Delivers. And ﬁnally, your
order will be delivered by a dedicated Starbucks-trained Ele.me driver within 30
minutes.
Now not only will delivery be oﬀered through Starbucks stores. But we also have the
opportunity to leverage the growth and scale of Hema supermarkets with the
introduction of Star Kitchens. Starbucks is the ﬁrst retail brand to establish a
dedicated back-of-house location in their supermarkets. Star Kitchens will be able to
utilize their distinct fulﬁllment and delivery capabilities and, ultimately, extend
Starbucks to their 10 million customers.
Starbucks Delivers is a ﬁrst of its kind up-level delivery experience built in China for
China.

John CulverWe announced the partnership in early August and since that time, the team in
China has moved at China speed to implement and execute Starbucks Delivers. At
the end of September, we were in 150 stores in Beijing and Shanghai. In early
November, Kevin was in Shanghai and announced at that time that the program had
been expanded to 1,100 stores in 17 cities. And I'm pleased to share with all of you
today that after four months from the announcement, we have accelerated and
expanded the program to now reach more than 2,000 Starbucks stores across 30
diﬀerent cities. Now to put that into context, since we launched Delivery in the ﬁrst
store in September, the China team has activated 1 store every single hour for the
past 84 days. That's China speed. That's a can-do attitude.
Now as we move forward and as we roll out delivery and get it stood up, we're
focused on, number one, building; number two, gaining trial and repeat; and
number three, continuing to optimize delivery coverage around our stores. These
are the very early days of our rollout of the program and we anticipate that as we
ramp the program, we're going to gain a much better understanding as to the
overall impact for the business.
Now beyond Starbucks Delivers, we're also rapidly expanding our partnership with
Alibaba in other areas. Our next opportunity that we're launching today is the very
ﬁrst-ever virtual Starbucks store, which enables customers to enjoy a one-stop
Starbucks experience, utilizing the Starbucks app or Alibaba customer-facing mobile
apps. In a few hours, when the day begins in China, hundreds of millions of
Starbucks and Alibaba active digital users will have access to this virtual store.
Customers will experience a seamless and easy-to-use interface across multiple
digital platforms. Let me give you an example of this "ﬁrst of its kind" experience. I
want to have a little fun here.
Let's say John Ivankoe wants to send a Starbucks gift to John Glass right here, okay?
He wants to send them a gift. And sends them a Starbucks gift through Say it with
Starbucks, right? John would access the Starbucks virtual store through his Alipay
app where he can then purchase a digital gift card. At the same time, it's the
holidays, right? I want to give a little something else. A little piece of merchandise
maybe, right? You can also add a physical gift like a holiday tumbler from Starbucks
Tmall ﬂagship store. And as you're doing this, you say, well, what about me? I want
my beverage, my favorite beverage. What do you drink?
Black coﬀee.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Black coﬀee, okay. I want a grande black coﬀee, right? Well now you can order that
grande black coﬀee through Starbucks Delivers and have it delivered by an Ele.me
rider. What was previously done across 3 diﬀerent apps can now be completed
without the customer leaving their Alipay app, all while earning Stars on the
Starbucks Rewards program.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13

Page 25 of 49This latest digital innovation revolutionizes the traditional oﬀ-line to online model
and meets an emerging customer demand and customer trend we're seeing. And it
also eﬀectively extends the reach of the Starbucks Experience into the everyday lives
of our customers regardless of where they are or what time of day it is.
Now to kick oﬀ this new digital experience, Starbucks is partnering with Tmall and
dedicating today as Starbucks Super Brand Day. This will give us top placement
across all of Alibaba's major online properties. And the day will focus on using
targeted marketing campaigns to reach customers and introduce them to this
revolutionary digital experience.
By leveraging this unique partnership with Alibaba, we will continue to push the
boundaries and bring disruptive innovation to the market to further strengthen
Starbucks' digital leadership position. And I'm very, very excited and I know the
China team is as well, about this partnership and about the opportunity.
Now the last area I want to cover relevant to the fourth place is the future of our
loyalty program in China. As you've heard on many occasions, the current rewards
program in China, it's a very diﬀerent program than what we have here in the U.S. It's
a paid membership program that we introduced seven years ago and today has
more than 7 million active users. Last week on December 5, we up-leveled the
program to Starbucks Rewards in order to recognize and reward members in more
relevant and meaningful ways. Leveraging our learnings from the U.S., the new
program allows customers to register for free from either the Starbucks app or all of
the Alibaba apps.
Now as part of the new program, customers can prepurchase coupons, they can
load cards, they can move to the next level and they can continue to reward
themselves based on what they're buying in our stores. This change, together with
the strong referral pipeline from Alibaba, enables us to accelerate member growth
and build a more direct connection with our customers. It is a very exciting time for
the fast-moving digital landscape in China and really, the rapid evolution that is
taking place. And now more than ever, we feel we are strategically positioned to
capture and, more importantly, to lead on this emerging opportunity.
Now I'd like to switch and comment a little bit on our progress in East China. As
many of you know, we've worked for a full year on the integration of the business
and are incredibly pleased with the progress that we've been able to make. We have
successfully integrated all of our East China partners and harmonized all salaries and
beneﬁts. For our stores in East China, our returns remain healthy. They're in line with
our expectations. And we have conﬁdence in our growth prospects in this part of
China going forward.
This acquisition was the largest ever in Starbucks' history and beneﬁts our business
on the Mainland across multiple areas. It allows us to speak with one voice to our
customers and our partners. A big unlock. It allows us to strategically prioritize our
investments across the entire market. It allows us to move at China speed in a rapidlyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 26 of 49changing market, while streamlining decision-making and, ultimately, it allows us to
provide clarity of focus on what we need our partners to do in order to deliver our
growth aspirations going forward.
As a reminder, beginning in January, East China will enter the comp base for the
total China market. And important to all of us, we're ahead of our initial projections,
which we shared on our deal model call earlier this year.
So let me now shift and talk about the opportunity we see in the at home and away
from home channels in China. Building on the success of our bottled Frappuccino
and Doubleshot beverage platforms, in June, we launched our Chilled Cup. We
talked about that at the May conference. The Starbucks Chilled Cup has been
incredibly popular with Chinese millennial customers and the success of the Chilled
Cup has enabled us further grow our double-digit market share within the RTD
coﬀee category.
Today, RTD coﬀee in China is worth about $1.2 billion annually and estimated to grow
double digits over the next ﬁve years. During the same time, we expect our business
to grow from 50,000 points of distribution to 125,000 points of distribution. And
from 40 million servings annually to 200 million servings annually.
And now, we have an even greater opportunity in China through our recently
announced Global Coﬀee Alliance with NestlÃ© to capitalize on the tremendous
whitespace that exists in building the at-home coﬀee, single-serve and foodservice
segments. The alliance gives us the opportunity to gain ﬁrst-mover advantage,
unlock the at-home and the away-from-home channels, while leveraging the strength
and expanding the reach for Starbucks across Mainland.
So let me spend a little bit of time and talk about the Global Coﬀee Alliance. This is a
unique and powerful partnership where 2 leading global companies have come
together to leverage the unique capabilities of both organizations to accelerate
growth of coﬀee around the world. I've had the unique opportunity to understand
ﬁrsthand the power and potential that this alliance can create. As I shared with you
earlier, I've been with the company now for 16 years. But prior to coming to
Starbucks, I worked at NestlÃ© for 16 years.
With Starbucks, you have the most recognized premium global coﬀee brand in the
world with the largest global retail footprint that continues to grow and accelerate.
With NestlÃ©, you have the world's largest food and beverage company, with a
presence in 190 markets and a deep history and focus around coﬀee. NestlÃ© has
also built the fastest growing at-home premium single-serve platforms with both
Nespresso and Dolce Gusto.
And the power of the alliance is created when you leverage our leadership position
in premium coﬀee and the awareness of our brand and the NestlÃ© infrastructure
and capabilities across all these markets to sell, to distribute and to grow Starbucks
within the CPG and foodservice channels.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 27 of 49Thomas D. ShawSo building on those strengths, the alliance is focused in 3-key areas: First, growing
our share of Starbucks capsules on Nespresso and Dolce Gusto platforms; second,
accelerating our leadership position in North America; and third, expanding the
international presence of Starbucks coﬀee in those channels. It's been just under
four months since we've combined our eﬀorts and I want to give you a sense of the
work that we've done to date. As we announced on our last earnings call, we've now
transitioned over 500 Starbucks partners to NestlÃ© in North America and in
Europe. The alliance has been working at an unprecedented pace to prepare for the
global rollout of the Starbucks at-home coﬀee portfolio.
Working together, teams from both NestlÃ© in R&D and coﬀee have developed a
range of Starbucks-branded products that meet our quality standards and the ﬂavor
proﬁles customers have come to expect. Products have been speciﬁcally formulated
for Nespresso and for Dolce Gusto. And later on during the break, if you have not
done so already, we have some samples of the new Starbucks-branded Nespresso
capsules out in the lobby that I would encourage you to taste. They're absolutely
outstanding. It will blow you away.
Now beyond the product side of it, we've also been working on how we want to go
to market in the market launches and how we're going to go about doing that. We
launched, beginning this spring. And we continue throughout the year and we're
going to launch in strategic markets where we see the biggest opportunity and
based on the current size and scale of Starbucks' presence today. All products are
going to be available in traditional CPG and foodservice channels. And we're very
excited about the possibilities that this is going to create for us and for them.
Now given the ﬁnal details of the closing, we now expect this deal will become
accretive to the company in ﬁscal 2020 and which is a bit ahead of the prior
guidance that we have provided of three years or sooner. And a little bit later, when
Pat comes up, I know he will share more details about how you should be thinking
about that in his presentation.
I want to take a moment to just recognize the partnership we've built with NestlÃ© in
a very short period of time. It's been clear that in working together, we have a
common purpose and that we're aligned on what we both want to achieve. I'm
looking forward to having the opportunity to continue to work on capitalizing on this
opportunity to continue to ﬁnd ways to create value for both companies and to have
a positive impact for the coﬀee industry overall.
Now in closing, I recognize that I've shared a lot over the last 30 minutes. But I think
it's important that all of you understand the optimism we have for the opportunities
in China and with the Global Coﬀee Alliance. I have no doubt that by continuing to
take a long-term view in building this business, executing our plans we've laid out
that we will deliver growth aspirations going forward and make our partners and our
shareholders very proud. Thank you very much.

Hi. Welcome back, everyone. Looks like we're all taking a moment to get settled
here. So to kick oﬀ the second part of the day, I'd now like to introduce our new
CFO, Pat Grismer. So Pat joined Starbucks, yes, just a 5 short weeks ago. So he's
gone through a lot here. He's brought over 30 years of ﬁnance and leadership
experience from The Walt Disney Company, Yum! Brands and, most recently, as CFO
at Hyatt.
So without further ado, I would like to now welcome Pat to the stage to discuss our
growth model.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. It's terriﬁc to be back in the category.
And it's great to look out into the room and see so many familiar faces. Yesterday
marked my 1-month anniversary with Starbucks. And I was thrilled because I passed
my 30-day probationary period. Then Kevin pulled me aside and he said, "You know,
Pat, we need to extend that probationary period by 24 hours to account for the
conference today." There's nothing like a little bit of pressure to motivate you to
bring your A game.
Now speaking of A game, I have to tell you, I was quite fascinated by some of the
reports that were published in the wake of my announcement speculating what
focus or approach I would bring as the new CFO at Starbucks, everything ranging
from asset-light guy to a thinly veiled characterization as a sandbagger. Now I will
speak for myself. And in the seven years that I've had the privilege of serving as a
public company CFO for great, branded enterprises, I have been guided by 3 things.
The ﬁrst is to build a great team. The second is to champion growth. And the third is
to maintain a tight focus on long-term shareholder value creation while maintaining
an open dialogue with the investment community. That is my commitment. And
that's what you can expect from me here at Starbucks.
So why did I join Starbucks? The answer is really quite simple. It's rooted in 3 things:
the brand, the company's mission and our growth potential. Starbucks is an iconic
global brand that is celebrated around the world. And what a privilege it is to be part
of that. The mission is honorable. And it's underpinned by noble goals that form the
foundation of a culture that is very distinctive. Who wouldn't want to be a partner?
And the third is the growth potential. And as Kevin mentioned, Starbucks already has
enormous scale. And yet, Starbucks has a very long runway for growth. And how
exciting it is to be a partner who is going to help design the ﬂight plan.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 29 of 49So it's only ﬁtting that the theme of my presentation is about growth, double-digit
EPS growth at scale. And today, I will walk you through our growth algorithm that we
characterize as an ongoing growth model. And what I mean by that is that it's a
growth model that can sustain double-digit EPS growth for years to come. Now there
will be years where noncore or nonrecurring events and items change the proﬁle of
our growth rate in a particular year. And we will take care to clarify for you when that
happens, as is the case in the current year. And with this presentation, we are
reaﬃrming the guidance that we provided for ﬁscal '19 in conjunction with our
Fourth Quarter 2018 earnings call. And later in the presentation, I will provide you the
bridge between the ongoing growth model and ﬁscal '19 guidance.
So at the highest level, what this growth model calls for is annual non-GAAP EPS
growth of at least 10%. This is before, as noted, noncore items to the current business
and ongoing growth model. I'll share with you the building blocks of this growth
model. And it's really quite simple when you think about it, comp growth, unit
growth and margin management, all underpinned by a disciplined capital allocation
model that is instrumental to our ability to drive that growth and to deliver
compelling shareholder returns.
So I'll take each one of these in turn, starting with comp growth. And as a reminder,
when we report comp growth, it's for our company-owned stores. And here, I've
segmented it into our 2 key markets, the 2 key markets you've heard about today,
the U.S. and China. So globally, we're expecting comp growth of 3% to 4%. That is
led by our largest market, the U.S., at 3% to 4%. This includes a roughly equal mix of
transactions, pricing and average spend growth. Now for China, we're expecting a
more modest rate of comp growth, 1% to 3%. And that may seem low to you in the
context of what this business has delivered historically and what we all know to be
the potential that China has for the long term.
But there are 3 factors contributing to this relatively modest rate of comp growth.
And you heard John talk about these. Sales transfer, which is deliberate and planned
because of how aggressively we're moving to capture that ﬁrst-mover advantage, to
lay claim to those premium locations in cities across the country. So we expect
there's sales transfer that will weigh on our comp growth.
Competition. We have to acknowledge that competition is intensifying. Now it's our
belief that, that competitive impact is relatively short-lived because of the strength of
our brand proposition in China.
Then third, the economy. The Chinese economy continues to grow at a very robust
pace. But it has softened in recent years. And we're seeing that in our comp. Now
John also mentioned that with the acquisition of East China, East China will enter our
comp base starting in the Second Quarter. And we do expect that, that will dilute, to
some extent, our comp growth for the overall market. But I want to make very clear
that even as we set a modest expectation for China comp growth, our enthusiasm for
the long-term potential of this business is undiminished. And our conﬁdence in the
strength of our competitive position is undiluted.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 30 of 49So let's move to the next building block in our growth algorithm, net new unit
growth. And again, I'm segmenting it into our 2 key markets, U.S. and China.
Globally, we're expecting robust new unit development -- net unit development of
6% to 7%. In the U.S., we're expecting 3% to 4%, which, when you consider how
heavily penetrated the U.S. market is, highlights that for Starbucks, we still see
signiﬁcant opportunities to expand our footprint. And as Roz described, we're taking
a very careful look at where there are compelling opportunities to increase the
representation of the Starbucks brand. And that's what's guiding our development
eﬀort. Within the U.S., 3% to 4%, that equates to about 550 net additions annually. So
that incorporates the eﬀect of store closures as we optimize our portfolio. And about
60% of those will be company-owned and operated. In China, we're anticipating,
again, aggressive growth to capitalize on the potential of the market, mid-teens
growth. That represents a pace of about 600 new store openings annually.
So let's move to the next building block, which is revenue growth, which is a
composition of comp and units as it relates to our retail business, our more
dominant business. That drives enterprise revenue growth of 7% to 9%, with the
retail business contributing 8% to 10%. Then you can see channel development
delivering a more modest pace of growth at 4% to 6%, an important part of our
business that is now strengthened through the Global Coﬀee Alliance. We do expect
channel development will contribute more signiﬁcantly to total revenue from ﬁscal
'22 onward, given the expected ramp-up in international market penetration through
our partnership with NestlÃ©.
So let's move to operating income margin. And here, the way I'd like to talk about it
is in terms of the operating income margin that we are conﬁdent we can deliver.
We're expecting operating income margin to be relatively stable in the range of 17%
to 18%. Now because we are anticipating ﬁscal '19 to be a relative low point, given
the year 1 impact of the Global Coﬀee Alliance as well as the annualization of tax
reform-related investments in our partners, we're expecting slight margin accretion
over the ensuing two years.
Now as noted on the page, this is a complex equation, a number of factors, some
accretive to our margin, some dilutive. And to us falls the responsibility of ﬁnding
that right balance, in the interest of strengthening our brand for the long term, to
drive the growth and realize the full potential of our business. So on the accretive
side, absolutely, we're anticipating our comp growth to support meaningful sales
leverage. At the same time, we're expecting to continue to leverage our global
supply chain infrastructure to yield eﬃciencies. You also are aware of the
commitment we have made to realize eﬃciencies above the store in G&A. And that
will contribute to margin improvement over the next couple of years. Then ﬁnally,
you heard Roz talk about what's happening at store level, store level productivity
eﬀorts to drive eﬃciency, to create capacity, to accommodate transactions
particularly at peak. So a number of things we're doing between sales driving and
process engineering to unlock margin opportunity. But importantly, that also creates
room for us to make the very necessary investments to further strengthen our brand
and drive for long-term growth.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 31 of 49So what's diluting our brand -- or our margin performance in the next few years?
Wages, particularly in the U.S., whether as a consequence of legislation or
competition and certainly from the standpoint of continuing to do what we have
done to invest in the employment value proposition that allows us to attract and
retain the very best talent that is instrumental to our ability to deliver a highly
diﬀerentiated third place experience that is at the heart of Starbucks.
Product mix. As we expect to continue to build our food business, that adds to our
absolute operating proﬁt. But it does have a dilutive impact on our operating margin
percentage.
Strategic investments. Many of you had the opportunity to experience the Reserve
Roastery store. That's an example of a strategic investment that we are making to
further elevate our brand or, as Kevin said, to amplify our brand in ways that, again,
strengthen our point of competitive diﬀerence and help forge the way for continued
growth. Another example would be new equipment platforms that underpin the
product innovation that is going to help to fuel the top line.
Investments in digital, the fourth place that, again, contributes to that steady top line
performance. So very deliberate, very focused, highly disciplined strategic
investments that are an important part of driving the long-term growth of the
company.
Then ﬁnally, commodities. Given where coﬀee prices are at today, we do expect that
coﬀee prices will creep up over the next few years. And that is baked into our model.
So again, a complex equation, multiple factors that we are managing carefully with a
view on how we're going to set up our brand and the business to maximize our full --
and realize our full potential.
So let's talk about cash because, as I mentioned before, I want to talk about and
share with you our thinking around capital allocation. And it starts with the amount of
cash that we generate from our business. The fact is, that our business generates a
very signiﬁcant amount of cash. In the last three years, our operating cash ﬂow has
averaged $4.5 billion. And we expect in ﬁscal '19 that we will generate more than $5
billion of operating cash ﬂow.
And so that raises the natural question of, what do we do with all that cash? And
that's where disciplined capital allocation comes into play, to fuel growth and fuel
returns.
Long term, our capital generation does come primarily from operations. But I would
highlight that we top that up with moderate new debt issuances, consistent with our
leverage cap at 3x lease-adjusted EBITDA and a minimum credit rating target of
BBB+, Baa1. You can see that we're expecting our capital allocation to be fairly evenly
distributed across each of 3 categories.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 32 of 49First, investment, investment in growth, because we see the opportunity to realize for
our shareholders signiﬁcant returns from these growth investments. And I'll talk in a
minute about the top category of investment for us, which is new store development,
which is concentrated in our key markets of the U.S. and China.
Second would be a competitive dividend. Our earnings payout ratio is in the range
of 50%. And that has yielded a dividend yield or return of about 2%, which we ﬁnd
very compelling in the context of our growth rate as a company. And we know that
our shareholders appreciate this return.
Finally, ongoing share repurchases. Now what I mean by ongoing is what we believe
our ongoing growth model will sustain outside of any noncore or nonrecurring
sources of cash that allow us to top up those share repurchases, as is the case in '18,
'19 and '20. So we expect, on an ongoing basis, this growth algorithm will support an
EPS beneﬁt from share repurchases of about 2%. And that's after interest at the 3x
leverage target that I mentioned earlier.
So let's talk about new store development, because as I mentioned, we see
signiﬁcant return opportunities. And we -- I will have to say, just based on my
experience and what I'm learning about the return model that we have in the U.S.
and China and how that compares to what I've seen before, these are quite enticing
returns. You can see less than a 2-year cash payback on new units that we built in the
U.S., less than 1.5 years in China. And there are 2 factors that are contributing to
these extraordinary returns. The ﬁrst is that you can see, in both instances, a very
high sales-to-investment ratio of approximately 2x. You also see very high cash
returns. And it's the powerful combination of these 2 factors in that investment return
equation that yield overall returns on investment that are nothing short of tantalizing,
unlike anything I've seen in this space. And that's why we give such preference and
priority to that part of our capital allocation model, to unlock these returns for the
beneﬁt of Starbucks shareholders. And I love the fact that this investment not only
creates value. But it drives growth.
So let's add it all up. Revenue growth, 7% to 9%; operating income growth of 8% to
10%. And here, you see that slight accretion in our operating income margin
percentage that we're expecting in the next few years. Laddering up to EPS growth
of at least 10%, double-digit EPS growth at scale. And again, this is an ongoing
model that we expect will sustain for the foreseeable future. And as I mentioned,
signiﬁcant noncore items and events change the shape of this model in a year where
we have those kinds of events. And a great example would be the Global Coﬀee
Alliance. So I'll talk about that just a little bit further, building on what John shared
earlier.
What you see here for ﬁscal '19 and '20 is the impact on consolidated ﬁnancial
metrics versus prior year. What we're anticipating in ﬁscal '19 is that we will lose
about $500 million of revenue, taking segment revenue for channel development
from $2.3 billion to $1.8 billion. On a consolidated basis, that dilutes our revenue by
2% to 3%. The impact to operating income is more pronounced in the range of 7% to
8%. However, given the strong cash proceeds, after tax, related to the upfrontFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 33 of 49A - Kevin R. Johnson
Q - Robert Marshall Derringtonpayment as part of this agreement with NestlÃ©, we are in a position to upsize share
repurchases to an extent that limits the EPS impact to 1% to 2%.
Then in ﬁscal '20, given the continued beneﬁt from share repurchases and how that
ﬂows over from '19 to '20. And we're lapping the income statement impacts of the
alliance, we're seeing accretion to EPS. That is earlier than we had anticipated, as
John had mentioned. And that's entirely a function of the ﬁnal accounting treatment
for that upfront payment and how that enters our revenue stream.
So I mentioned to you that I was going to provide a bridge between what I've
described as an ongoing growth model and what we have guided for ﬁscal '19. And I
also want to share an outlook as to what that looks like in '20 and '21. So for ﬁscal '19,
what you see here is a conceptual reconciliation, highlighting the puts and takes that
bridge that ongoing model to the guidance that we had given, that we are
reaﬃrming today.
So you see streamline items and events like acquisitions, divestitures, investments,
restructurings. There's a lot of noise in the numbers. But you net it all out and what
you see is, that our ﬁscal '19 results will be lower than that ongoing growth model.
And again, the numbers here are consistent with previous guidance. But the reverse
is true in ﬁscal '20 and '21.
So here is a high-level outlook of what we expect those two years to look like on
average. We're getting the beneﬁt of share repurchases and continued contribution
from our G&A eﬃciency eﬀorts to yield EPS growth of at least 13% when you look at
the two years combined on average. Now given the cadence of our share
repurchases, we would expect ﬁscal '20 to be above that number and ﬁscal '21 to be
below.
So we're very excited about this ongoing growth algorithm that sustains double-digit
EPS growth for years to come. And we're conﬁdent that the plans and initiatives that
the team has shared with you today will unlock the brand's potential and deliver the
results that I've talked about.
Again, I'm excited to be back in the category. I look forward to spending time with
many of you. And at this stage, we're thrilled to take your questions. And so I will
invite to join me up here on stage our presenters, Kevin and Roz and John as well as
our Global Chief Marketing Oﬃcer, Matt Ryan. Thank you very much.

A - Kevin R. JohnsonBob Derrington from Telsey. Two-part question. One, on -- as we think about Uber
Eats in the U.S. and the opportunity there, how do we think about the economics or
the contribution? Obviously, positive to earnings. But how should we think about the
margin impact of those sales as they come into the pool? Then I've got 1 quick
follow-up.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Okay. Roz, do you want to take that?
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
I'll take that. So that's a very good question, because we are monitoring that in terms
of the size of the ticket in reference to the price of delivery. And one thing I will say is
that we are seeing an expanded ticket because of the number of items that are in
the order. So we're monitoring that. The second item that I will tell you that we're
seeing in this work that we're doing is that, that number is varying. If we're in a very
dense market, we're seeing a really good ticket and really good performance. In less
dense, we're not seeing as good performance. So that's one of the things that we're
monitoring as we roll out. We're rolling out initially in some of the more dense urban
metro markets. We'll learn more. And then we'll come back to you and be able to say
really what we're seeing and really pool that together. But it is something careful that
we need to really watch that.
{BIO 1517514 <GO>}
As the second part of that question, as we look at that incremental -- the delivery, we
know there were some issues with Mobile Order and Mobile Pay at one time. How
do you avoid those kind of issues overloading a store location that may not have the
capacity?
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Absolutely. So a couple things we're doing. We have put a tremendous amount of
focus on the software integration piece. And so at this point, we are integrating the
software. When you see in most QSRs, you'll see several diﬀerent iPads in the back,
we will not have that. It will be 1 ordering system where it comes in. And so that work
is happening right now as we go national.
{BIO 1517514 <GO>}
So the stores have the capacity in the urban markets? Or will there be a delivery
kitchen?
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Right now, there's capacity to produce in the store. And so we're producing right
there behind the bar. It's working.

A - Kevin R. JohnsonI would just also add. We are open to learning from the Star Kitchens that John
talked about in China. So that is also a tool that we could use in the U.S. But I think as
Roz says, it's early days. And I think the work that they've done for us to really learn
and adapt is the right work.
Is there a microphone? Okay, over here, then we'll come back to the middle.
{BIO 7208345 <GO>}
Jeﬀ Bernstein from Barclays. Kevin, as we think about the U.S. business, or Roz as
well. But in terms of traﬃc, I mean, we look back over the past couple of years and
traﬃc has been ﬂat to negative. It seems like that's a challenge, whether it's capacity
constraint, competition, cannibalization. It seems like there's a variety of factors, let
alone the macro. But I know in your comments earlier, you made it sound as if, last
quarter, you saw an uptick in pretty much every metric. And that seemed to have
continued this quarter. So I'm just wondering, when do you presume you'll get back
to consistent positive traﬃc? It sounds like the 3% to 4% comp guidance includes 1/3
eﬀectively positive traﬃc. So it sounds like you're expecting that over time. But is that
something you'd expect in ﬁscal '19? And of all the initiatives that you talked about,
like which -- could you just prioritize maybe the top -- couple that you say would be
the driver that would get you back to traﬃc positive whenever you expect that to
happen?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes, let me start and then I'll let Roz add to this. I think, number one, the transaction
growth we see in our transactions, if you look at the overall food and beverage
industry or restaurant industry, transactions have been down in the restaurant
industry. We've outperformed that. But that said, we still have been slightly negative
-- well, I think 1 point negative on transaction growth last quarter. The things that start
to change that certainly are the experience in the stores. We see that in the morning
daypart, we are growing transactions in the morning daypart because of all the work
that went into increasing throughput at peak. And then we lose some of those
transactions after 2:00 p.m. The reason we were losing some of those transactions
after 2:00 p.m. was because a lot of the cleaning in the store was happening after
2:00 p.m. And as Roz took you through, all the initiatives that the team has been
driving are starting to ﬁx those things. So for us, we have to stay very focused on the
initiatives that Roz outlined: the store experience, beverage innovation and digital.
We think those are the keys to transaction growth. Roz, I'll let you add.
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
I think you nailed it, Kevin. Then I think this other piece around delivery is sort of
helping us to ﬂatten out the business over time. And so we're watching that carefully
as well. And that's not in our number for this year. But we believe that, that's some
upside as well as we go forward with delivery.

A - Matthew RyanOne of the things you were talking about was beverage. Cold beverage seems to be
kind of a subtheme with regard to the U.S. comp. Frappuccino having been a drag.
And some of the cold beverage seemingly picking up steam here. Are there any --
when you look back in the last year, is -- are you going to think about the below
average or below what your guidance is in terms of comps as a little bit of a cold
beverage problem that you're now past? And if that's the case, is it the Frappuccino
drag is diminishing now and you're beginning to really get to scale on some of these
other platforms? And maybe there's some numbers you can put on that.
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Yes, yes. So I don't know if we can go deep into the numbers. But one thing I will tell
you is that as we saw the Frappuccino business in terms of the ticket that it delivers
to us, we are seeing a really nice movement and a replacement in some of those -- in
-- per beverage and what we're seeing in the cold platform. I will tell you that we
also, in the Fourth Quarter or second half of ﬁscal year '18, we did premium
Frappuccino. And so as we elevated the Frappuccino business itself, it did well. So
we're not moving away from the Frappuccino drink. We're just adding to that cold
platform and really responding to what the customer really wants. So there's no
movement away. We're trying to elevate the Frappuccino business. There's still
demand for it. But we're trying to take that up. So in terms of, are we out of the water
in that position, there's competition out there with Frappuccino. And we're just trying
to elevate it and then add to the cold platform.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes. The evidence last quarter was the fact that of the 4percentage point comp that
we delivered, 3 points of that came from beverage. And a lot of that has been the
work that Matt has been leading to really reshift the way that we're driving
marketing. And maybe, Matt, you want to add to -- a little bit to the focus on how
we're driving demand for the beverage industry.
{BIO 18012513 <GO>}
Absolutely. We're focused very much on transactions. And we have 2 levers. We have
this incredible advantage with the number of relationships we have with the
customers in Starbucks Rewards, adding to that now additional relationships, digital
relationships that are non-Starbucks Rewards. That allows us, in general, compared
to everybody else in our sector, to have a lower spend on paid advertising, which is
important. That said, we continue to leverage paid advertising when we need to. So
for instance, in a season like the current one when we have a lot more occasional
customers coming in for the holidays, we're able to be very targeted. And we've
gotten more sophisticated in our marketing as we were able to do closed-loop
measurements, where we can tell when somebody has seen an advertisement,
especially digitally, what happens to the behaviors in the store. And we've gotten
more and more reﬁned in terms of knowing what messages work with what
customers. And that's making our marketing performance something that we can be
a little bit more conﬁdent in moving forward.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13

Let's go over here.
{BIO 4804954 <GO>}
Sharon Zackﬁa with William Blair. Thank you for the detail on the margin
expectations. I guess, one of the things I was surprised was missing was geographic
mix shift, given that China, in particular, is so high margin. Is the inference there that
China is going to normalize in its margin structure, therefore, not be a tailwind?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
We are not anticipating a material shift in margin progression between the 2
markets. The reality is that even as China will continue to grow its store footprint at a
rapid pace compared to the U.S., the U.S. business will remain the dominant
business. And therefore, the margins of the U.S. business will continue to shape what
our enterprise level margin looks like. Bear in mind that when we talk about
operating margin percentage, that is a function not only of store-level economics but
takes into account our above store spending in terms of G&A and also factors in the
proﬁle of our channel development business. But we are not expecting between
those 2 businesses to be a material diﬀerence in how the margin picture progresses
over the next few years.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Kev, right here in the middle.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
Sara Senatore, Bernstein. I wanted to ask about the MSR program in the U.S. In
particular, one of the things that you pointed to were spend per member growth and
also then the reward enhancements. And I was hoping to get a little more color on
both. The -- it looks like the spend per member, the growth has kind of slowed
maybe sort of meaningfully in the last couple of quarters. And I was just wondering if
that's right and if it has to do with sort of the mix or just in terms of who the
additional members, what they look like or if there's something else going on and if
you can reaccelerate that. Then in terms of the reward enhancements, it sounds like
maybe the rewards will be richer. So are there margin implications for either one of
those?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Matt, do you want to take that?
{BIO 18012513 <GO>}
Sure. With regard to the sort of spend per member issue, we continue to see growth
in spend per member, which is healthy in the single digits. Now a couple years ago,
we had the introduction of Mobile Order and Pay layered onto a step change in
personalization that happened all at once. So we saw tremendous growth for a while
in spend per member. What we're continuing to see right now is accelerated newFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13

A - John Culvermembership growth, which is terriﬁc, because the more people we have digital
relationships with, the better for us as well as continued growth at the time and
spend per member. Now we have a lot of things we're doing to focus on keeping
that going with technology and marketing innovation. So we're very conﬁdent that
we're going to continue to see growth in spend per member. With regard to the
program changes moving forward, the big set of changes moving forward will come
next quarter when we will have a multitier redemption oﬀer. And what that means is
you'll be able to redeem your Stars on a lot more things. And you'll be able to start
redeeming those rewards much faster than you currently do in our program. The way
that we've structured this will actually help from a margin perspective as we are able
to oﬀer diﬀerent tiers on diﬀerent products, including some higher-value products,
that will, net-net, in a pro forma, help margin moving forward.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Let's see. Let's go over here.
Could you please talk about what you anticipate to be the customer proﬁle and the
order proﬁle of delivery and if there are any diﬀerences between what you're
expecting in the U.S. and China? And also, would you ever have dark stores, I guess,
if delivery were (important)?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Let's have John start with China and what we've experienced with Starbucks Delivers
in China. And then maybe, Roz, you can add what we learned in Miami.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
So I think for us, we're just now getting some traction on delivery in China, ﬁrst oﬀ.
So any of the results are still coming in to really validate it. We are seeing an initial
uptick in the morning, all right? So that's usually a slower period in our business in
China. We're seeing a higher attach, which is good news. The customers are
generally millennial customers working in oﬃces. But also, we're seeing people at
home ordering delivery as well and people ordering larger-ticket -- a total ticket
that's larger than the average spend in a store. So we're going to continue to ramp
up the delivery program. I think the things that I hit around building the awareness,
gaining trial is going to be a big unlock. We've got some work that we're doing with
Alibaba to raise the awareness within the apps themselves and their access to
Starbucks Delivers. Then when you look at it expanding beyond our Starbucks stores
into the Hema kitchens. And we've opened 2 Star Kitchens with Hema markets, one
in Hangzhou and one in Shanghai. These are kitchens that sit in the back of the
house. And it's a dedicated area where we're basically producing Starbucks
beverages that the Ele.me riders that come from that store grab the Starbucks order
as well as whatever the customer is ordering from the supermarket. And so we see
big opportunity with that. And we'll continue to roll that out. They do about 10
million customers a year right now. So I think we're going to unlock opportunity to
reach those. Then in addition, when you look at the apps across Alibaba, Kevin
quoted a number of over 600 million active users, we will gain access to thoseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13

can get those customers to attach into Starbucks and become part of our rewards
program and part of the delivery program or order through the virtual store.
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
And on the U.S. side, I would say that we were in about 200 stores in Miami. Our
performance was stronger when we were near like large oﬃce buildings or hospitals
or some type of controlled facility. We did see food attach in that business. We did
not -- we have not applied any marketing to it at all. It was all by pulling up the Uber
app and then noticing that Starbucks was there. So we've got work to do to ﬁgure
out, well, then who purchased and then follow through to really get the qualiﬁcations
of who's purchasing. But right now, we know at least physically where those orders
were going to. And we know what kind of ticket they were ordering.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes. I think average ticket in the Miami pilot was something like 2.5x to 3x what we
see across our business in that range. That would be a range of orders. Some would
be very large. Some would be single beverage. Let's go here in the middle.
{BIO 17258322 <GO>}
Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. So the new U.S. comp outlook is around 3% to 4%,
slightly diﬀerent than what it was. And 1% to 2% coming from digital, which I think
you guys have talked about historically. So where does the other 2 points come from
strategically when you think about the bottoms-up build?
Then just separate from that, it looks like you have about 10 million digital
relationships outside the MSR program. What can we -- how can we think about what
you're trying to do to convert those into higher, more frequent customers moving
forward? Because I think this is at the largest that pool has certainly ever been.
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Brian, I'll start oﬀ. And then, Matt, if you wanted to add anything. First of all, when
you look at the comp performance, you're right about 1% to 2% from digital
relationship. But then we have a little bit in there for price. Maybe -- we've always
said about 1% to 2% on price. Then there's beverage innovation that's in there, new
beverages that are in there. And so like Kevin said, our comp performance in the
Fourth Quarter, 75% of it came from beverages. So when you put that combination
together, that begins to bring that -- bring the total to about 3% to 4%. And Matt, you
might want to talk about the second half of the question.
{BIO 18012513 <GO>}
Yes. So with regard to the -- speciﬁcally the question again.
{BIO 17258322 <GO>}
Yes. It was just -- you have 10 million digital relationships.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13

The digital relationships. Right. Yes. Sorry about that.
{BIO 17258322 <GO>}
And I was just wondering how you convert them.
{BIO 18012513 <GO>}
So the way to think about that is that those people represent the top of the funnel for
us, because there are people that haven't yet joined Starbucks Rewards and we just
begin to market to. Once we learn more about their behaviors and their histories,
once we learn more about what they respond to, we're going to see more and more
eﬀort as we enable marketing that's more targeted and personalized. We have not
really begun that yet, that is to come. But like we have already seen is the marketing
we've done to convert them into Starbucks Rewards members has been one of the
largest contributors to the acceleration of growth of the rewards program. So we
know that it's a group of responsive people who engage with us. And then the trick
is to get them to engage more through mechanisms like loyalty.
{BIO 17258322 <GO>}
Can I just ask, what's restricting them from moving into the MSR program? Or what is
the biggest hurdle from getting them into the MSR program, those digital
relationships that you have?
{BIO 18012513 <GO>}
The biggest hurdle is to create awareness and understanding of the program. So
people are always on a journey to learn about it. And once we get somebody --
people to understand the beneﬁts of the program. And certainly, with the
introduction of the multitier redemption coming very soon, there will be more
reasons to join. And we think that we'll see an acceleration in membership coming
from that group of customers into the future.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Let's go over here.
I have 2 questions. The ﬁrst is, I think you've talked in the past about when you
convert customers onto the MSR program, you get a 30% lift in their frequency. I
guess, does that number still hold? And do you see that when you convert to the
partial digital relationship? Or do you expect to see that when you convert to the sort
of full MSR? I guess, how much of that lift have you seen when you -- on that 10
million customers?

Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 41 of 49Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Matthew Ryan
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - John Culver
A - Rosalind Gates BrewerSure. We continue to see within the MSR program the same kind of incrementality
that we've always seen. So that story has not changed at all. We continue to monitor
that very carefully. With regard to those other customers, the people with digital
relationships who have not yet joined MSR, it's not the same customer. These are
people who have not yet engaged or not respond to the loyalty mechanism. So you
don't see that same kind of uplift upon somebody joining that. That takes more time
and more work to get them there. But they become that large pool that you start to
market to and bring people in over time.
But you still expect that lift to kind of be similar to what it's maybe been in the past?
{BIO 18012513 <GO>}
I wouldn't take the 30% incrementality number that you've been using for MSR over
that when somebody signs up for a digital relationship with us. That's not proven yet.
But what we'll see is more and more of those people, when we do convert them into
the SR program, having that kind of incrementality.
And I just have 1 other question. Just in terms of what you've seen in China with
delivery, are you seeing most of your customers access Starbucks Delivery. And I
know it's early. But through the Starbucks app? Or are you seeing them use third-
party apps? Then as you apply that to the U.S., do you expect them to come in and
use Starbucks app or a third-party app? And I guess, it begs the question of, do you
view Uber Eats as a competitor to the Starbucks brand or not?
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
For us, in China, we've seen the partnership with Alibaba, obviously, customers that
frequent the Alipay app, which is one of the most frequented apps in all of China,
use very heavily. But they're also using the Starbucks app. They can also frequent
delivery across other Alibaba apps as well. We don't see it through other third
parties because we haven't built those relationships with other third parties. I think
the power of the Alibaba partnership is the size and scale and reach that they have.
The beauty of what we've created with them on the app side of things is that they
have access, if it's Alipay, Ele.me, Tmall, they can go right into that app and click on
to the Starbucks icon and go right into our app. So it's a 1 click. And that gets rid of a
lot of the friction. Then they can also automatically sign up for the rewards program.
So the beauty of the partnership is we've leveraged their size and scale, their
technological know-how and really getting into much stronger customer
relationships and increasing the reach and scale for Starbucks.
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
And on the U.S. side, eventually, you'll be able to access both through the Starbucks
app and the Uber Eats app. And right now, we don't really view them as a
competitor. We're working together to integrate the software. And so the
partnership is very strong right now. So we don't view it that way. But eventually,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13

back over to the other side of the room.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
Dennis Geiger, UBS. Roz, I wanted to ask you a bit more about store productivity. You
talked a lot about initiatives focused on optimization, throughput and eﬃciency. But
just can you touch a bit more around productivity throughput, the opportunity there
as far as timing, the magnitude potential impact on sales, how signiﬁcant this could
be going forward?
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Right. So a couple of things I'll say there is that you can't underestimate, again, when
we open up this relation between the partner and the customer, we know that, that is
the real opening opportunity for us. I would tell you that we think that there's upside
in a few things. One, when the automation comes in for us to really get our deliveries
correct, right. So all the incoming goods that come into the store will reduce waste.
Then our back rooms, as orderly as they can possibly become and right behind the
bar, gives us some opportunity. Now in terms of putting numbers onto it, we're still
learning what the numbers are. The biggest number that we have right now because
we've been monitoring it so closely is our customer connection scores. Then looking
at the stores with higher customer connection scores and looking at where their
transaction numbers are, we absolutely see an improvement there. So those are the
hard data numbers that we have right now. And we'll learn more as we put in the
automation and then turn over the dollars. And you'll see it in terms of the margin.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
Great. Then just 1 real quick follow-up, if I could. When you talked about the comp
breakdown in the U.S., food wasn't really a part of that. That's driven probably 1 to 2
points at least over the last couple of years. There's probably a bunch of diﬀerent
ways to slice it. But can that be upside? It wasn't emphasized a whole lot today. But
can food be the upside driver to the algorithm that you just kind of touched on?
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely. You bring on a good point there, is that we -- food is deﬁnitely an
opportunity for us. Where the work that we're doing with Mercato, which is primarily,
right now, an 11:00 on meal opportunity for us, basically salads, you've possibly read
about it. But yes, that is conﬁgured in this number when we talk about transaction
growth. And so that all comes together. It also -- just one quick thing is that the
digital relationship is we notify people that we've got food and that it's expanded,
we're also seeing it grow.

{BIO 16184643 <GO>}
Adam Sindler, Unicom. On the Uber Eats versus baba, one thing is diﬀerent is it
looks like the Alibaba employees are actually employees of Alibaba. Uber Eats
drivers are really contract people. So how do you ensure, one, that the Uber Eats
driver will help sort of adhere to a brand standard for something like Starbucks?
Then, two, just around safety, right, like it's easy to tamper with a beverage that isn't
locked or something like that. How do you sort of ensure that it stays safe throughout
the process?
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Yes. So one of the things, just being in Miami, watching the process come through,
our partners are actually seeing repetitive Uber drivers. So they're getting to know
that Uber driver. And they're treating them as a partner. And so they're having --
they're building relationships in those localities. Then also to some of the work they
were doing with Uber is to really address that situation in terms of what we believe
food safety is and how the quality we want to maintain over a period of time. And
that's why we're doing this work with Uber. And so we're having those conversations.
And also, to the next leg to drop and the work for us to do is the packaging piece.
And so that our packaging work is progressing as we learn more. And so I will say
that China has -- we're adopting some of the work from China in terms of the
packaging that they have. And so you'll see that be ongoing as we roll this thing out.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
I'll just say, even in the pilot though for food safety, we put a tamper seal on
everything that was delivered to a customer. So if that seal was broken, the customer
would know if they have some concern perhaps. Let's go over here, Kev.
Nick Setyan, Wedbush. I wanted to maybe revisit some of the headwinds on the
margin you talked about, maybe get some more details there. When would you
expect the wage headwind to maybe peak? Is it 2019? Is it 2020? The product mix,
obviously, that seems to have improved with the larger beverage contributions. So
that was a little surprising to see it in there. The strategic investments and, obviously,
commodities, when are you thinking that we're going to see the headwinds in
coﬀee? Particularly as the beverage has improved the contribution and with the G&A
eﬃciencies, perhaps we were a little surprised to see only such a tiny bit of leverage
from revenues to operating margin.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Yes. Well there's no denying the fact that the U.S. hourly wage pressure is the most
signiﬁcant dilutive factor in that margin equation. Based on what we see happening
by way of state legislation as well as competitive pressure for the talent that is so
critical to the third place experience that we provide as well as, as I mentioned, the
value that we place on having a competitive total compensation or total rewardsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13

Q - Priya Joy Ohri-Guptapackage that attracts and retains that great talent. So given the importance of that,
we see sustained investment in that part of our P&L in order to protect that aspect of
the experience. That is the #1 contributing factor to what I qualiﬁed as the dilutive
impacts. But I would also highlight the continued increase in strategic investments,
given their importance to driving the top line result. So whether, as I mentioned, new
equipment and platforms, like the rollout of Nitro to provide the beverage
innovation that forms a key part of driving the transaction growth and the growth in
average spend, continued investments in technology to drive that point of diﬀerence
as it relates to how we form and build on and leverage the customer relationship, all
of those have a tendency to weigh on margin to mitigate what we would otherwise
expect to be the accretive impact of sales leverage, to start with. But also all of the
outstanding initiatives that are happening at store level as well as above store to
drive greater eﬃciency. It is a complex equation. But much of what weighs on margin
actually contributes to the top line performance that we're anticipating.
Just as a follow-up. Is there any ﬂexibility there? So just in case, let's say, beverage
contribution declines within the comp, I mean, can we pull back on some of these
investments to maintain double-digit EPS growth? Or is this a very rigid algorithm?
So if we do fall oﬀ by 50 or 100 basis points in the comp...
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Maybe I can address some of that. So just to give an example, for the planning and
replenishment, that's a software investment that's a onetime investment to bring in,
to automate all of that work. If we need to slow down all of the items that we need to
automate, we can do that, because they're all independent of each other. So we'll --
we can invest, look at performance, invest and look at performance if we needed to.
So a lot of the tech investments are the same thing. Now I will tell you, the two are
intertwined, because when we get these investments and we see the improvement
to make reductions in other areas, that can fall to the bottom line or enhance the
experience in the store. So they are intertwined. So -- but we'll -- we can manage it
carefully. There's not a lot of long-term, consistent, hard, like multiyear -- we just
completed a new platform investment at the company that was multiyear. A lot of
what we're doing right now is not as multiyear as what we have done in previous
years, if that makes sense.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Over here. Kev, over here somewhere. Just got a question. Yes, right here.
{BIO 15889787 <GO>}
Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays. Pat, I was just wondering if we could sort of clarify
the point on leverage really quickly when you talked about sort of operating around
the 3x level. Before the presentation in June, you guys had talked about operating
inside of 3x. So sort in the 2.6x, 2.9x range. Then as we think about the cadence of
share buybacks and the opportunity to sort of hit that number, should we expect that
to be sort of loaded into 2019 where you sort of get to that number? Or will it be sort
of multiyear?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13

Q - Karen Holthouse{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you. So the way we think about leverage is that the 3x represents a cap.
And the credit ratings represent sort of a ﬂoor, if you will. So we would not exceed
the 3x lease adjusted EBITDA. And we would maintain a minimum credit rating of
BBB+, Baa1. And so that gives us a range within which to work. As it relates to the
cadence of share repurchases, as you know, we have very heavy share repurchases
in 2018. 2019 started oﬀ with a very signiﬁcant ASR. We would anticipate the balance
of share repurchase activity against the $25 billion total shareholder capital return
goal to be more heavily weighted in '19 and '20. The '21 beneﬁt is more of a
carryover beneﬁt from the share repurchases completed in ﬁscal '20.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Thank you. Let's go over here. We'll take 2 more questions. So maybe over here. Yes,
right here. Microphone. Then we'll go over here on the side of the room.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
Karen Holthouse from Goldman. One quick guidance clariﬁcation and then a
question. When you were talking about unit growth, should we be thinking about the
550 in the U.S. and 600, as those are the ongoing sort of absolute unit targets? Or
should we be thinking about percentage unit targets?
Then just on the overall algorithm, presumably over the next three years, there's
going to be some pretty meaningful G&A savings that hit that corporate and other
segment. But you're still guiding to a pretty constrained overall operating margin
range. Is the oﬀset that you expect continued margin compression in the Americas
segment? Or is there something I'm missing?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So ﬁrst, on the unit growth, we articulate the growth model in percentage terms. And
then I mentioned the 550 and the 600 as representing averages, if you will. But I
would think more about the percentage growth and our ability to sustain that over
time. I just wanted to give another point of reference in terms of what that might
equate to by way of units. As it relates to margin progression and the role that G&A
plays, we do expect the results of the streamlined work to continue to deliver
beneﬁts across the next three years. But really, as a consequence of some of those
dilutive impacts, you're seeing then a tempered eﬀect from those streamlined eﬀorts
in terms of how they can further support margin. But I think an important thing to
keep in mind here is that the margin performance is, to a large extent, tied to what
we expect our comp performance to be. So we do expect sales leverage from that
range of 3% to 4%. But we need something closer to 4% to see a sustained margin
expansion from sales leverage as against some of the oﬀsetting pressures. So you
would have to see a sustained closer to 4% comp to see more meaningful margin
expansion over that period of time. I don't know if that answers your question.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
Is that fair for the U.S.? Is that globally or fair also for the Americas segment?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-13

So that -- so the guidance is global in nature. As I mentioned before, we don't see a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence over the next three years in terms of segment-level margin
progression and the extent to which those play into what we're seeing or expecting
at the enterprise level.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Okay, we'll take the last question over here somewhere. Here, let's go here and I'll
go, John.
{BIO 18945772 <GO>}
Mark Sprtel from Schaper, Benz & Wise Investment Counsel. Just want to dig in on
the G&A piece, just a little bit more, Patrick. There were some comments, sort of
guidance given at one point that the G&A, as a percentage of revenue, was about 1
point higher than it should be. Just want to know if those are your thoughts and if
that 1-point improvement is baked into the improvement that you had on the slide
from the streamlined activities. And I'll just ask my second question right away.
Digging into the comp anatomy a little bit more that's crucial for margin expansion
or at least maintaining margin, how important or critical is transaction growth to
maintain the 17%, 18% or growing the margin?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Thank you. So I'll talk to both of those points. First, with respect to G&A, what we had
communicated by way of a G&A savings target over the 3-year period is working and
our long-term growth model. The impact of that is however mitigated by some of the
dilutive impacts that I've talked about. So that is in there. In terms of my familiarity
with that road map, that is something that I will be spending time on in this next year.
So I have not yet had the time to dig into it, to the extent that I will, to inform, I think,
a better point of view -- a stronger point of view on how we are set up to deliver
against that. But we have incorporated that into our long-term growth algorithm.
With respect to the composition of the sales comp and how much we're expecting
by way of transactions, the importance of transactions is that we would expect the
preponderance of incremental transactions to be beverage transactions, which carry
a higher margin. And so that's why the transaction component of that base 3% comp
is important in terms of the role that, that plays to provide the sales leverage
necessary to help oﬀset some of those dilutive eﬀects that I've talked about.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Okay, we'll take the last question here, John, since you were kind enough to let Mr.
Culver use you as an example for social gifting, you get the last question.
And I got my black coﬀee outside.

A - Kevin R. JohnsonThat's right. It's perfect. Did we send John his?
We've been e-mailing back and forth about speciﬁcally what he wants. But yes, it will
be something. And I'm not kidding about that. Okay. So -- and thank you, for an
external client, for kind of involving us in that chat. So anyway we're having a good
time. So thank you. And I do appreciate it. First, Roz, a question for you. I mean, you
kind of tucked into your presentation hitting 1/3 of the stores in two years on the
renovation strategy. I mean, you obviously -- a peer of yours. I mean, it's kind of like a
very big part of the investment case of remodeling stores and adding capacity and
digital functionality, what have you. So can we talk about how big of an idea that
could be for Starbucks in the U.S., I mean, whether from a top line perspective or a
margin perspective and then continue to talk about what the opportunity is for the
other 2/3?
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Sure. When we think about our renovation strategy, our #1 priority in that is to bring
forward the equipment innovation. That will enable the beverage growth and the
beverage innovation that we talked about. Now, typically, when we have to put in a
new piece of equipment, it causes us to renovate behind the bar. So that's our ﬁrst
priority. The second priority is to incorporate diﬀerent components of the need state
of convenience. We'd like to do some work to remodel the area where MOP is and
the landing spot where now we're getting into more convenience with pickup and
delivery in our stores. So that's the second priority, again, fueling the top line. The
third piece is sort of the decor piece. And so decor, to make sure that, that third
place is maintaining exactly what we want in terms of the look and the feel of the
stores. I will tell you, what's diﬀerent in this is that we had typically gone to -- straight
to a furniture improvement, right, or the lighting. And this time, we're going for
functionality that grows our beverage innovation, that changes our transaction
position. So that's the diﬀerence in this. And that's why it's so important. The last
thing I will tell you is bringing on new formats. And so we're learning a lot more
about -- we have a large percentage of cafÃ©s. And we are looking at opportunities
for total MOP stores in certain areas, small units, more drive-throughs. So looking at
the throughput and capacity of a building. Then we have some buildings that are
actually just too large. And so we're looking at that as well. What I hope you see
when we ﬁnish this work is that we've almost created an ecosystem in 1 area of a
store. So if you're a person that likes to pick up fast or you need to sit one day, the
stores are 2 miles apart. You can decide which store you want to be in. So that's how
that format piece will come forward.
And two years ago, maybe four years ago, we talked about the premiumization of
Starbucks and potentially adding a lot of reserve components to the stores. I mean --
but that's, I guess, not necessarily a '19, '20 initiative or that would be done more on
a one by one?

A - Thomas D. ShawWell keep in mind, the draft was created in the Starbucks Reserve Roastery and the
Reserve stores. And much of the innovation is around cold and draft and nitro. And
so that is at the center of what we are doing. I mean, that's an example of how we're
elevating...
But not necessarily adding physical reserve bars, for example, like we see in certain
stores?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
No. That's right.
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
That's correct. You won't see those.
Okay. All right. Perfect. Then secondly, the question on cap. I mean, you were nice
enough to kind of talk about what we needed for the Americas segment to grow
margins. Your cap, it looks like, on a same-store margin basis, whatever that
expression would be, you would delever on the comp guidance that you've given,
given labor costs, rent costs, maybe even delivery costs in that market. Obviously,
there's a lot of moving pieces in cap, there have been for years. So what do you think
kind of what cap margins are when we think about a through the cycle margin cap?
What should we be thinking about over the next couple of years as part of your
algorithm?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well we were not and we are not intending to provide segment-speciﬁc margin
guidance. We intend to keep it more at the enterprise level, recognizing that it is a
function of not only our retail businesses but also our channel development
business, which is changing with the Global Coﬀee Alliance, not to mention what sits
above the segments as it relates to kind of corporate G&A. So it really is a composite
of all those various things. And we think that it's most valuable and it's clearest to
speak to what we believe that operating margin percentage to be over this period of
time, in line with the level of comp growth that we're expecting as well as the
transformation of our channel development business.
