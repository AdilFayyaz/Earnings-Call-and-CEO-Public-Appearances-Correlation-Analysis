It is really a pleasure to be here with you today and Tom and I are looking forward to
walking you through our North American performance. On behalf of all of us who
came down here from New York this week, I also want to thank you for giving us
even a couple of hours away from the Northeast chill. So it is a pleasure to be here
with you in Florida.
Before we begin let's take note of our safe harbor statement. As you know, some of
the statements today will include forward-looking remarks and non-GAAP ﬁnancial
measures.
Now for those of you who I have not personally met or have not had a chance to
meet Tom Greco, let me quickly handle some introductions.
Now after spending many of my early years at PepsiCo working in both North
America and Europe, as was mentioned, I spent a few years receiving little education
in US retailing, spending time working at both Safeway and as the CEO of Sam's
Club. I am now moving into my third year leading our America's food businesses.
And as I like to say, I really do feel as if I never left PepsiCo, I just missed a few
meetings along the way.
Tom Greco, who is here with us today, leads an outstanding business and team as
Frito-Lay North America. Tom has also had signiﬁcant roles in his career at PepsiCo,
as the Chief Commercial Oﬃcer for our America beverages business, as the
President of Global Sales and as the President of Frito-Lay Canada.
Now let me start by turning our focus to North America, which for PepsiCo, as you
know, is a critical driver of our PepsiCo revenue with over 50% of PepsiCo's revenue
coming from the United States. North America is where our businesses of PepsiCoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 2 of 21America Foods, our American beverage businesses and Quaker North America are
based. And because we manufacture and distribute both leading food and
beverage products we have signiﬁcant scale in many of the markets we serve and
particularly right here in the US.
As you can see on the right-hand side of the screen, our measured channel sales are
nearly twice the size of the next largest food and beverage competitor here in this
very important US market. But as you've been hearing all week throughout this
conference, the industry is seeing signiﬁcant changes in the consumer and in the
retail landscape.
In the consumer space we are seeing strong demographic shifts with the rise of the
millennial generation while millions of baby boomers are aging and retiring every
year. Additionally, we are seeing growing diversity in the United States with the
growth in Hispanic and the Asian population.
Against these changing consumer dynamics we see shifting needs such as the
increased need for portability and on the go options. With our customers we are
seeing signiﬁcant channel shifting. With the value channel, such as dollar stores. And
the premium channel growing faster and becoming a bigger grocery shopping
destination. We see new formats emerging such as e-commerce, options like
AmazonFresh and the continued growth of Walmart.com.
To deliver in this new environment we need to center on the power of the "and", A-
N-D. Our playbook balances focus and scale. We believe that in this slow growth
North American environment we are going to need to focus on scale and we're
going to need to make sure we are focused on operating our businesses to win.
In order to grow our key categories we are focused on understanding what it takes
to drive growth in individual categories. We have made signiﬁcant investments in the
Frito-Lay ﬂavor kitchens, our culinary center, to create and test outstanding new
ﬂavors that are now appearing in our Frito-Lay products here in the US as well as
products around the world.
Balancing this focus is scale, which enables us to have the money to pay for the
capabilities to grow and eﬀectively execute our playbook. Our size gives us scale
leverage in areas such as procurement, IT, back oﬃce, joint PepsiCo customer teams
and R&D innovation, allowing us to create new growth opportunities while delivering
productivity and higher margins.
To deliver on focus and scale our playbook is anchored on four key priorities --
building our brands; driving consumer led innovation; enhancing execution; and
continuing to deliver productivity. So ﬁrst let's discuss how we are building our
brands.
In the United States market today we have 19, $1 billion global brands. Globally we
have 22, $1 billion global brands in our portfolio. Over the last few years we haveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 21signiﬁcantly increased our support in building these brands, reinvesting some of
those productivity savings.
To continue to build these $1 billion brands and our regional and local brands we
have leveraged investments we've made in foundational demand space insights. Let
me highlight some of those insights we have gained from our proprietary
methodology which was ﬁrst piloted at Frito-Lay North America and is now being
extended to our beverage businesses.
We know from our proprietary insights that currently 65% of the addressable US
snacks, breakfast and beverage market addresses common or complementary
needs where snacks, breakfast and beverage brands interact. You know yourselves
the choices you make at breakfast or at a break during the day, be it the iced coﬀee
you drink with a snack in the middle of the morning or the chips you eat with a drink
at the end of the day.
Our foundational demand space insight helps us better understand how to position
our brands to meet these common or complementary needs. These insights also
drive new innovation as well as the promotions we design. Understanding how to
best fulﬁll these common or complementary needs is the basis for our approach to
Better Together.
For the remaining 35% of the market it is crucial to understand what drives distinct
consumer needs. One example is the work at the Gatorade Sports Science Institute
to better understand the hydration needs in the recovery after a workout.
At PepsiCo our investment in insight highlights for us that growing the business will
require addressing both these distinct needs and the common or complementary
needs. It is this philosophy, coupled with our desire to give consumers a choice that
ranges from good to you to fun for you that underpins our PepsiCo portfolio.
Given these demand insights let me take a few minutes and highlight a few demand
opportunities we are currently targeting. In the morning the jumpstart demand
space where we have Tropicana, Naked and Quaker brands to leverage and pair
together to prepare consumers to start their day.
In the oﬃce/school break demand space we have products like Starbucks beverages
and our Frito-Lay multipacks to help our consumers address their hunger and
perform throughout the day.
For our young and hungry consumers we have the absolute perfect pairing, Doritos
and Mountain Dew, which combines two fast-growing brands.
And ﬁnally to connect and have fun times together we have our Pepsi CSDs and
Tostitos chips and salsas.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 4 of 21The promise of Better Together is realized when we innovate for these common or
complimentary needs, position our brands as a portfolio to meet diﬀerent needs and
drive co-merchandising and co-promotional support.
One very successful example that really highlights how insights are driving our
promotion is the gaming pairing of the limited edition Doritos gamer pack and the
Mountain Dew game fuel. We activated these products through a promotion where
each product sold enabled our consumers to win points and potentially win an Xbox
One. We allowed that young and hungry consumer to fulﬁll some of the
requirements by buying Doritos online at Amazon.com. Suﬃce to say, the gamer
promotion was a huge success.
Now let me turn to our second priority, innovation. We have leveraged our
proprietary demand space insights to step change innovation at PepsiCo. Our
record in 2013 has been outstanding. Nine of the top 50 innovations in the US in
2013 were PepsiCo products. Nine of 50. We have spoken previously about the
successful work we've completed with Taco Bell. Tom is going to highlight that later
today.
But based on our culinary innovation and expertise across food and beverages we
recently won a food service partnership with Buﬀalo Wild Wings. We are busy at
work right now with Buﬀalo Wild Wings creating some new excitement for their
upcoming menu.
Our third priority is execution. We come together across food and beverage to
deliver integrated execution both at the customer headquarters and in each and
every store. At the headquarters of our major customers you will ﬁnd joint business
planning processes along with dedicated PepsiCo customer teams. In stores you see
integrated food and beverage displays and promotions.
PepsiCo is a company focused on execution and we are building the appropriate
tools and frontline culture to further strengthen our executional capabilities. And one
of our customer teams, the Dollar General PepsiCo customer team, was awarded the
marketer of the year.
This is just one of the many examples; we are routinely recognized by our largest
customers for our broad food and beverage expertise and our ability to drive growth
across their total box.
Our PepsiCo sales teams work with our retail partners to leverage our insights, our
brands and our executional capabilities to create excitement for their shoppers.
Now I'd like to show you one of the examples of how we brought insights to media
and all the way to the shelf with one of our key customers, Walmart. This is an
example of an ad they run for a program they call, game time. Let's run that clip.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 5 of 21Tom Greco(Video in progress).
Now as you might imagine, I absolutely love that ad. And it is the ultimate example
of Better Together at PepsiCo. And I can tell you nowhere was our execution more
visible than at the Super Bowl a few weeks ago. No Company, no company showed
up for the big game the way we did -- print, outdoor, mobile, digital and outstanding
in-store execution.
Finally, all of this is underpinned by a productivity agenda that uses common
engines, tools, systems across both snacks and beverages. For example, you have
heard about our go to market engine for Frito-Lay. We call it GES; it stands for
Geographic Enterprise Solutions. GES is a critical investment that drives large
productivity across Frito-Lay.
We are making the investments to scale GES across North America and at the same
time we are now scaling GES to other markets including some major metro markets
in Latin America. We are also scaling up a GES like approach in beverages with an
investment we call geo box. In part through these initiatives we expect to continue to
deliver $1 billion of productivity a year through 2019 across PepsiCo.
We've also spent time wiring PepsiCo to gain leverage from our scale both in North
America and globally. Our capabilities include global procurement, integrated IT,
joint customer teams, global R&D and worldwide talent management enabling us to
provide cross sector experiences.
Having made these investments we are now realizing the beneﬁts, much as you saw
with the Walmart ad, with new innovation we are bringing to the market as well as
margin increases we're seeing across our total North American businesses.
In summary, we are truly operating as one PepsiCo and we're focused on going
forward and executing our playbook Better Together through our brand building,
driving insight led innovation, enhancing our execution and driving productivity
across our system we are prepared and ready to win.
Tom is now going to take you through how that playbook unfolds at Frito-Lay and
then we will come back and handle Q&A at the end of Tom's presentation. Tom.
{BIO 15063682 <GO>}
Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone. It is really a pleasure to be here today with
you to talk about PepsiCo. As you saw last week, 2013 was a very strong year for
Frito-Lay. We delivered balanced performance across each of the key metrics. We
are pleased to report volume growth of 3%, net revenue growth of 4% and 6%
growth on the bottom-line.
Importantly, we made excellent progress on market share as we held or gained
share in all of the market share metrics we monitor across both the US and Canada.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 21And trust me, we watch market share every single week.
Importantly, we are very focused on PepsiCo's long-term growth model and the
building blocks that are central to the success. First, building brand that consumers
absolutely love. Second, driving excitement to our category by oﬀering
diﬀerentiated innovation targeted to speciﬁc consumer occasions and needs. Third,
executing with absolute excellence throughout our supply chain and in the
marketplace. And fourth, accelerating productivity to grow.
Since we look at every aspect of our business through the lens of the consumer let's
start with how we create demand. Two years ago we introduced a new consumer
framework, demand spaces. The intention of this work was to go very, very deep on
snack occasions. To understand thoroughly and completely what drives choice
within the broader macro snack universe of over $100 billion.
We went deep on how people snack when they are alone, when they are with others.
We better understood how health and wellness impacted decisions on snacking. The
foundational insight here was that drivers of needs diﬀer based on the context of the
occasion. Fundamentally, brands and products that deliver against the identiﬁed
occasion speciﬁc attributes drive consumption and market share.
Knowing that there are approximately 67 snack occasions per month in America
helped us better understand the size of the prize and how to get there. As you can
see, we still have plenty of room to grow with just eight of the 46 macro snack
occasions per month. To reinforce -- all of our work starts and stops with consumer
demand insights.
We understand the size and growth potential of each demand space. More
importantly, we know how and why consumers make choices inside each demand
space. We have learned a great deal about these demand spaces in the past two
years with much yet to be learned and applied to our business.
These demand spaces inform everything we do, our innovation agenda, our brand
building, our media plans and how we execute in the marketplace. We call this,
media to shelf. As an example, Lay's Do Us A Flavor was a huge brand building
investment to capture what we call the enjoy and indulge demand space. What
better way to capture this opportunity than to let consumers create their own brand
of Lay's?
Do Us A Flavor invited consumers across North America to submit a ﬂavor that they
wanted us to launch. We expected a big response but we were overwhelmed when
the ﬁnal submissions were dramatically above our expectations.
This campaign had a terriﬁc blend of brand building elements. Breakthrough digital
and mobile engagement was embedded in every single touch point all the way to
the shelf. Let me tell you the ﬁnalists -- Cheesy Garlic Bread, Sriracha and yesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 7 of 21Chicken & Waﬄes were ﬂying oﬀ the shelves when we brought them to market. This
year the program will be even bigger.
Let's take a look at how we are introducing it. It is called choose your chip. Let's roll
the video.
(Video in progress).
Believe it or not on the launch day we had over 100,000 submissions in 24 hours. Of
course we are no strangers to putting consumers in control of our agenda. Once
again we had great success this year with our Doritos Crash the Super Bowl event.
Within the young and hungry demand space Doritos has a heritage of putting
control in the hands of its fans and empowering them. This year we went global and
we had submissions from all over the world. Two of the 5,400 consumer generated
ads ﬁnished in the top four on the USA Today ad meter.
In every year we have run Crash the Super Bowl we ﬁnished in the top four. Time
Machine received the most fan votes and cost our winner just $300 to produce. Let's
watch.
(Video in progress).
I think you will agree that Doritos consumers not only love our brand, they are very
clever and very creative.
In addition to marketing we have also signiﬁcantly stepped up our investment in
R&D to drive diﬀerentiated products. And as a result 2013 was one of the biggest
years for innovation in our history. Our innovation sales as a percentage of revenue
increased a full point versus 2012 and it was more incremental than in the past.
We captured the party occasion with Tostitos cantina, as Brian mentioned. A
blockbuster innovation which achieved more than $100 million in sales in 2013. We
also had success through Lay's Do Us A Flavor and Cheetos Mix-Ups.
Additionally, we are continuing to build our foodservice partnerships through
innovation. As Brian said, our beverage relationship opened the door for us with
Taco Bell to unlock growth in the huge away from home consumption occasion.
Doritos Locos Tacos' cumulative sales are now over $1 billion. Following the highly
successful launch we are adding six additional PepsiCo beverages to the Taco Bell
lineup to help beverage buﬀs Live Mas while they sip.
Additionally, Taco Bell will be the ﬁrst national QSR to oﬀer Manzanita Sol, an apple
ﬂavored soda that has crossed borders. In fact our 2014 innovation calendar is
loaded across our portfolio. As examples, we will capture the party occasion withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 8 of 21Tostitos Fajita Scoops and Queso Blanco; both of these products are oﬀ to a
blistering start.
Young and hungry Doritos consumers can look forward to three mystery ﬂavors in a
bold ﬂavor experiment. These ﬂavors are so bold we couldn't go through our normal
test protocols. We are looking for bold taste testers across America to tell us which
one is boldest.
Rold Gold provides fun break time snacks that deliver on taste and enjoyment. Rold
Gold pretzel thins will deliver on this. It is a thin ﬂat pretzel with new packaging and
Frito-Lay ﬂavor expertise.
Squarely on trend for healthier snacks we continue innovating with our Sabra JV
including new ﬂavors as well as a Sabra Rold Gold grab and go package.
Of course our investments in brand building and innovation are ultimately
dependent on wiring our execution. As I mentioned earlier, our ability to execute our
plans from media to shelf is a true diﬀerentiator for Frito-Lay.
Over the past two years we have made substantial investments in our execution
capability. The end result is an integrated execution platform that enables us to
celebrate our brands in retail stores and foodservice operators across the country.
Last year's Do Us A Flavor captured the nation by storm with eye-catching displays
like this. And you can see this year's Choose Your Chip displays on the right and in
the marketplace right now. These displays celebrate what Lay's is all about --
enjoyment, fun and indulgent ﬂavors.
of course Frito-Lay snacks are always Better Together when paired with Pepsi. This is
exactly what we have done with Juntos Disfruntamos Mas, which means together
enjoyed more. We have launched this integrated Hispanic campaign on holidays.
This program has been a driver behind driving increased relevance with our
Hispanic consumers.
Our growth drivers at PepsiCo are very clear -- brand building that breaks through;
consumer led innovation; and absolutely best in class execution. I'll be the ﬁrst to
acknowledge that these skills are not unique to PepsiCo or to Frito-Lay. What I can
say is that very few companies can put them together the way we can with the scaled
brands that we have.
We are able to invest in brand building innovation and execution through a robust
productivity pipeline. Brian talked about PepsiCo's productivity planks earlier. Today
I will talk speciﬁcally about GES. GES stands for Geographic Enterprise Solutions and
it is both a productivity engine and a growth enabler.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 9 of 21Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Brian CornellGES is up and running in four sites across North America, in each case the project
has delivered against our internal hurdle rates. We monetize GES by realizing lower
inventory, accelerated growth, reducing cost, expanded SKUs in our DSD network
and improved freshness.
The terriﬁc thing about GES is our customers absolutely love it. GES eliminates
touches, it takes product hot of the manufacturing lines and delivers it direct to store
where a professional Frito-Lay salesperson merchandises it.
What is left you ask? The retailer simply needs to check the product out at their
register. Bottom line, GES is an outstanding cash ﬂow story for our customers.
Productivity initiatives like this allow us to invest in the business and complete the
virtuous circle.
So in summary, we are very excited about our current momentum at Frito-Lay North
America, we are fortunate to be participating in an attractive category. We see
signiﬁcant runway to grow in the broader macro snack universe. And our competitive
advantage is our ability to integrate the components of our growth model all the way
from demand occasion to the store and bring media to shelf to life.
Finally, we are in a great position to leverage the strength and scale of PepsiCo. At
this point Brian and I would be happy to take any questions.
Questions And Answers
Thank you. I guess just two questions. First, there was a white paper that was
published earlier this morning. So understanding that Pepsi has put out a press
release. But to the extent that you can all talk about your response to that if there is
one?
{BIO 1841158 <GO>}
Brian, I would be happy to clear that an answer that right up front one time and try to
put that to the side for the rest of the Q&A. And the answer is going to be no
diﬀerent than the answer you heard last week. And we have obviously spent a
signiﬁcant amount of time studying diﬀerent structural options.
We have reviewed those from a management standpoint, we have reviewed those
with the Board and we have concluded the best option for the Company and for
shareholders is to keep these businesses together.
So we are shifting our focus now to running the business and really making sure that
the playbook that Tom and I talked about today, we focus on building our brands,
bringing great innovation to both snacks and beverages here in North America,
elevating our executional focus and driving productivity across both beverages andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 10 of 21Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Brian Cornellsnacks. That is where we are going to place our focus. But we have spent a lot of
time looking at it, Brian.
If I could just ask a follow-up about the process. There has been a lot of discussion
about the beverage business and the eﬀect of the beverage business.
But from your perspective as the Company went through that process and you had
to look at the prospect or potentially at the prospect of operating a food business, a
snacks business without the beverage business, could you talk a little bit about
maybe what insights you have learned, what is diﬀerent, what you have learned
through the process and what led you from the food side or from the snack side to
come to the conclusion that you are better oﬀ together?
{BIO 1841158 <GO>}
Well let's step all the way back and really talk about the power of the PepsiCo
portfolio today in a market like North America. And as you know very well, beverages
continue to be the largest sub cat across North American food and beverages. It is a
very big category.
It is going to be big in 2014 and if I come back and talk to you ﬁve or 10 years from
now we will continue to talk about the importance of the beverage business in the
US. So a scale business. It provides leverage across our entire portfolio. As a
combined food and beverage company we are the number one supplier to our
customers here in the US and across North America.
It brings beneﬁts to our snack business in many of the challenges -- or channels
where averages have a very strong level of penetration. Channels like C-store, the
opportunity that we have talked about in foodservice where, based on our beverage
relationship with a company like Taco Bell we've been able to expand our snack and
culinary presence. The same thing is going to take place with many other food
service operators.
So this is a big and important category for retailers. It wasn't that long ago I was
sitting in one of those retail chairs. Every week you talked about how you were going
to advertise, merchandise and promote beverages. So it gives us a very important
seat at the table.
We also have a very attractive position, as you know in the LRB category. We have
brands that are in the growth spaces, brands like Lipton where we are seeing great
performance with Pure Leaf. Brands like Starbucks that are driving growth in iced
coﬀees. Great trademarks like Gatorade in sports.
So we have a great portfolio of LRB products that are pointed in the right direction
today. And we think across North America the combination of snacks and beverages
gives us a very unique position with our customers but, importantly, with the
consumer.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 11 of 21Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Tom GrecoAll of the demand space work we have done has really given us clarity around how
well snacks and beverages work together in the a.m. day part, in that break time
occasion, at the end of the day -- and we think it puts us in a much stronger position
to operate as one company, continue to leverage the scale to drive procurement
savings, savings in our IT and back-oﬃce services and continue to make sure that we
are sharing insights and leverage across our go to market systems.
So we've done the evaluation, we have gotten a lot of input from others from the
outside, we looked at this from every single angle and we're absolutely convinced
this is the right decision for the Company, it is going to make us a stronger snack
food business, we're going to continue to strengthen our beverage portfolio and
we're going to focus right now on really operating these businesses and rolling out
our playbook.
Tom, Frito-Lay North America margins are at the high end of your CPG peers, you
talked about productivity in the GES program. Are you comfortable you can get
signiﬁcant margin expansion as you look out over the next few years or should we
expect a lot of that productivity to be reinvested back behind the business?
Then from a top-line perspective, you obviously had strong performance in 2013
which you highlighted particularly with the innovation success. As you look out to
2014 are you comfortable that can continue particularly with some of the US
consumer spending weakness we have heard about at the conference so far this
week?
{BIO 15063682 <GO>}
Sure. But maybe I will answer your second question ﬁrst. I think the top-line we are
very bullish. The way we reconstructed our agenda is really around this broader
macro snack look and I would describe it as if you take food and beverage in just the
US, including away from home it is $1.3 trillion, okay that is the size of the food and
beverage business, kind of split a little bit half at home, half away from home.
So in the at-home space we have really used the demand space framework that I
described to drive our agenda. Separating our brands so that they are really moving
away from being on top of each other which had been a challenge for us in the past.
So now when Tostitos goes after what you saw earlier, the party or the get together
occasion, there is nothing kind of tripping over top of it from a portfolio standpoint.
So very clear positioning of the brand inside of our demand space framework. Also
looking at where they are situated within mainstream value and premium space and
therefore what channel, what customer makes the most sense to drive that business.
We are pretty excited about the progress that we have had to date 2013. All of the
trademarks that Brian showed up there were growing mid; to high-single-digits. And
we see continued growth really sourcing from other macro snack competitors in theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 12 of 21Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Tom Greco
A - Brian Cornellbroader space with our core businesses. So we are pretty conﬁdent of our ability to
drive the at-home.
On the other hand, the away from home, think about that $650 billion. We really
opened up a new door with Doritos Locos Tacos, it far exceeded our expectations.
We built out the culinary center down in Plano to really better understand how our
brand can potentially connect with other QSR propositions.
You may have seen on the Olympics we had a chicken enchilada, Frito's chicken
enchilada sub with Subway, we are working with the Subway on a bunch of other
ideas. You saw the Buﬀalo Wild Wings piece. So in that broader away from home
space $200 billion is roughly QSR. We see some room to really make some pretty
big gains in there.
So collectively across the entire space we feel pretty good about our ability to drive
both volume and revenue growth and last year we ended up delivering at the very
high end of any CPG Company within food and beverage; I think we had the highest
absolute dollar growth of any Company.
On the productivity side, we see productivity as endless at Frito-Lay and at PepsiCo.
We have a robust agenda that ties to the $1 billion a year agenda that has been
outlined by the Company last week or extended by the Company last week. We play
a key role in that agenda and we know exactly what our platforms are to achieve it.
Largely GES is obviously a big contributor to our productivity agenda, automation is
a big contributor to the agenda. Then we have got a very signiﬁcant lean Six Sigma
eﬀort going on. We have 60 black belts in Frito-Lay, we have kaizen leaders and we
focus very carefully on every single line in the P&L. So we are conﬁdent in our ability
to deliver the productivity as well.
Okay. Can you talk about how much of that ﬂows through to the bottom-line if you
continue to expand margins given the high level you are at today versus how much
of it maybe needs to be reinvested?
{BIO 15063682 <GO>}
Well ﬁrst, I will say we have been reinvesting obviously in A&M. We had a signiﬁcant
uptick in A&M in 2012 and we built on that in 2013, we built on that in 2014. Similarly
R&D, similarly our execution capability. So we've been making big investments in
those three areas.
We don't give speciﬁc guidance for divisions on that topic. But obviously we are
balancing the investment with our ability to expand margins.
{BIO 1841158 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 13 of 21Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Brian Cornell
Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantI would just add to that. I think the -- because we get the question a lot about the
absolute margins which are really attractive. But I think Frito is really a pretty unique
business in terms of its market position and brand portfolio.
We watch what has happened with competitive price gaps and we are very
comfortable with where price gaps are right now and we are able to generate a lot
of productivity and support the margins we have and expand the margins because
of all these big scale advantages that Frito has.
So I think if you look at 2013, it was a pretty attractive year for Frito, good top-line
growth, good share performance, some margin expansion and that is sort of the
model we run. But we run the overall Company as a portfolio and we make
investment decisions market -- one market versus another, one business versus
another and over time we would expect Frito to have margin accretion.
I have two questions. One is you can clearly hear the enthusiasm about being part of
PepsiCo and Better Together and all of the work that you have done in the past six
months. So can you help us quantify what your sales growth and bottom-line growth
would have been if you weren't together?
{BIO 1841158 <GO>}
Sitting here today we have focused our time and attention as we have built our plans
for 2014 as one Company. And that is the perspective we are taking. And we're
going to continue to focus on how we build and drive our volume and revenue and
proﬁt as one Company.
So I'm not going to spend a lot of time looking back; we are spending our time
looking forward right now. And we are not going to give divisional guidance; you
know what our outlook is for next year. But our focus right now from a North
American standpoint is how we optimize our volume, proﬁt and share and operating
cash ﬂow as one PepsiCo Company that is in both snacks and beverages.
So that is the approach we are taking, we are going to look forward, we are not
going to spend a lot of time with the "what if's" looking back. And hopefully you can
appreciate that point of view. But we are focused right now on optimizing our
operational performance and we are going to look forward and continue to drive
things forward as one PepsiCo and one Company.
Okay. Then looking forward, something that you are facing in both businesses is kind
of a margin headwind, right. So from the beverages perspective it is clearly the
volume deleverage in North America. Can you talk a little bit about that.
I don't really know who to address that too. But can you talk a little bit about that as
you go forward and the impact that is on your business given the secular trend youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20

On the Frito lay business it is the mix eﬀect of deﬁnitely having much higher margins
than in the US and the emerging markets much lower margins and growing much
faster. So if you can help us quantify that and think about that going forward would
be helpful.
{BIO 1841158 <GO>}
Let me step back and I might have Jamie jump in here. But as we think about some
of the keys of success, the things that were embedded in our discussions today and I
think speciﬁcally about the North American environment which we know has been
challenging from a growth standpoint. But there is still growth in North America.
One of the things that we really have tried to understand through the demand space
work is where are those growth terrains? Where are there pockets of growth where if
we deliver on that consumer demand we are going to continue to unlock proﬁtable
growth?
How do we make sure we take those insights to really drive the innovation we are
bringing to market? Innovation that could be both product, it could be package, it
could be diﬀerent forms that allow us to make sure we are delivering channel by
channel, market by market what that consumer is looking for.
So I think that is a signiﬁcant unlock for us as we think about improving margins. And
price tag architecture, revenue management is going to be critically important. We
are obviously committed to accelerating productivity. And that is across all of our
businesses in North America.
And sharing some of the best practices we talked about really lifting GES across not
snacks only but snacks and beverages. Looking at opportunities for greater
automation as well as improving the eﬀectiveness of our front-line organization.
How do we make sure that we really transfer the capabilities from those insights all
the way to the front line organization. So we can be much more surgical, much more
granular with our executional capabilities.
And I think if we stay focused on those key areas. And the key is staying focused on
those areas, we are going to continue to ﬁnd opportunities to unlock growth in this
market, we are going to improve our share performance, we will turn that into proﬁt
margin accretion and we are going to run these businesses by leveraging that focus
and the scale beneﬁts that we can bring across all of our businesses.
So we are going to look to stay very focused on those key areas where we think we
can really unlock growth in a proﬁtable way and continue to reﬁne our playbook
across both snacks and beverages. Jamie, I don't know if there is anything else you
want to add?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20

I will take the two pieces of your question. North American beverages is going to be
a big contributor to the $1 billion a year of productivity. So we are absolutely all over
making sure that business is scaled to the growth.
Then on the margin geographic mix question, there is a natural drag, you are right.
So the faster growth the markets have lower margins than the portfolio average. But
over -- if you can extend the point of time, right, there's going to be volatility in those
markets. But they're going to have the highest rate of margin expansion as those
markets scale up.
And what we always like to point to is you can take a market like Mexico, which has a
lot of the challenges of a developing market in terms of ineﬃcient sort of
infrastructure. But that is a business where you have got a nice market position and
we built for caps and the margins in our Mexican snack business are not too far oﬀ of
the really attractive margins we have at Frito-Lay North America.
{BIO 1841158 <GO>}
Let me go back and build on that. This is a conversation you and I have had before
as we think about margins in our snack business. And how we really taken learning
from our Frito-Lay business in North America, transferred that down to Mexico. And
obviously we don't break out margins by country but we have talked about we are
delivering very attractive margins in Mexico.
And we have really used Mexico as what I describe as the model market for the rest
of Latin America. So the margin improvement we are seeing in Latin American foods
started with really taking best practices from Frito down to Mexico, in Mexico
building the model market for developing and emerging snack businesses.
We are transferring that learning and in some cases we are transferring the talent
from Mexico to Colombia, from Colombia to Brazil down to the south (cone), to
really make sure that that playbook that we have developed in Mexico, those best
practices are used throughout our developed and emerging markets in Latin
America.
So over time you're going to continue to see that improvement. You are right, there
is some mix pressure that we face; but we are quickly transferring those best
practices for Mexico to Brazil, which performed very well for us last year, to markets
like Colombia and Ecuador and Peru where we are seeing very strong growth in
market share improvement going to transfer that throughout Latin America.
I had two questions ﬁrst, Brian, just in terms of your progress you have made in
looking at the share demand space and capturing your share within it, because a
couple of years ago I think you weren't capturing your fair share and I think you've
tried to really improve on that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 16 of 21A - Brian CornellSo just wanted to see how much improvement you have gotten on that front. Can
you talk about what more you can really do to be dominant in capturing that
demand -- shares demand space? Then the second question is just in terms of the
Mexico tax situation and what kind of impact you were expecting speciﬁc to the food
business?
{BIO 1841158 <GO>}
So Julie, let's start and talk about the journey we have been on with demand spaces.
And while we are in really now year three of that work at Frito and we are quickly
transferring that to beverages we are still in the early stages. If I can use a sports
analogy, if this is a nine inning game we're in inning two.
We have done a lot of work to really reﬁne the methodology, embed that in how we
think about the business, how we make decisions. Tom talked about the important
work we did really begin to break our brands apart, understand what demand
spaces they ﬁt in, where we had share opportunities, where we had opportunities to
bring innovation, where we have opportunities to source volume from other macro
snack occasions.
So we are in the early stages but we're actually now looking at market share in each
one of those key demand spaces to really understand where we over index but,
importantly, where we under index. And that is going to give us a much better
roadmap to guide our brand investments, how we talk to consumers and,
importantly, it is going to guide our innovation going forward.
But we are in the very early stages and that is why I'm so excited about the work. We
have got the methodology in place, it is guiding us to make much better choices
around our brands and innovation, how we begin to unlock that growth and it's
going to be a measurement for us to say all right, how do we continue to grow
market share in each one of these key demand spaces.
From a Mexico standpoint I'd start, Julie, by saying ﬁrst obviously it's very early. I
think we are in week number seven now of the new tax increases.
But for anyone who is doing business right now in Mexico, this is a consumer that on
January 1 woke up to the realization that while all the reforms long-term are going to
be in the best interest of Mexico and the Mexican consumer, short-term they have
seen signiﬁcant increases in food pricing and really increases across all packaged
foods in Mexico.
So they are absorbing that, they are adjusting to that, they have seen prices go up
with packaged foods, they have also seen a signiﬁcant increase in fuel costs. So it is a
consumer right now that is trying to ﬁgure out how do they work with the pesos that
are in their pocket.
Our retailers are trying to adjust to this new environment, particularly the traditional
trade. And for those of you who have spent any time in Mexico, the traditionalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20

A - Tom Grecoretailer in Mexico is usually mom and dad, brother and sister who managed that
cashbox really carefully. Well they have seen it contract short-term.
We certainly expect as we work through the ﬁrst half of the year that the overall
Mexican economy is going to improve, that the consumer is going to work their way
through this and that we're going to see a rebound.
But the start of the year has been challenging for that Mexican consumer and it's
been challenging across food and beverage overall. But we are conﬁdent that by the
second half of the year these changes will continue to take shape and we will see a
restoration of growth in the Mexico market.
Brian, we didn't hear much about Quaker today and that is one part of the portfolio
that has had some struggles. Can you talk about that a little bit? Then, Tom, last year
you talked about segmenting the Frito-Lay portfolio in premium versus value. If you
can talk about that a little bit as well in terms of where we are with that development.
{BIO 1841158 <GO>}
Let me start by talking about Quaker. And you have sat through many presentations
this week and I think you have heard some of the challenges in center of store
categories. And Quaker has certainly been caught in some of the headwinds that we
are seeing with traditional center of store categories. It has really been a tale of kind
of multiple stories.
Our innovation at Quaker continues to really perform well with today's consumer. I
feel great about innovation like Real Medleys, areas where we brought yogurt to bars
and some of the things of that we have done across our portfolio.
But while the hot category continues to perform well, ready to eat cereal has been a
challenged category over the last several years, we have a signiﬁcant ready-to-eat
cereal business, the snack bar business has seen some additional headwinds.
So we are stepping back, we are continuing to focus on how we really build that
Quaker trademark, how we make sure we bring the right innovation, that same
demand space work to understand how do we unlock pockets of growth in that
Quaker portfolio.
So its work is progress right now. But what is working is innovation. So which tells me
as we look forward we've got a better understanding of what the consumer is
looking for. We have got a very trusted brand and we better make sure that we ﬁnd
ways to unlock and make the brand even more relevant going forward.
{BIO 15063682 <GO>}
Yes. And just quickly the work on mainstream premium value is really getting more
and more granular. We feel really good about it. We obviously start with demand butFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20

A - Brian Cornellthen stratify the occasion by mainstream premium and value.
And our innovation on a speciﬁc demand space, Stacy's as an example for premium,
which is in the midlife treat segment, we focus it on really hitting the demand space
drivers within that space. But recognizing that it is a premium price product we are
going to put it in premium channels, we are going to put it in premium stores,
granularly, ultimately.
Mainstream lots of success in the past year, most of our core brands are in there. So
a brand like Cheetos Mix-Ups source from a lot of big products within mainstream.
Then value we have had tremendous success in the last year with Funyuns, Chester
popcorn, Cracker Jacks -- we have sort of repositioned those brands to compete
very vigorously at a Walmart or a dollar store.
The quick one is if you could update us on Brazil, because you said you had a record
year in 2013, the consumer was very stressed. So does that all go well for the Mexico
situation that your categories do okay in tough consumer environments?
{BIO 1841158 <GO>}
Caroline that is a good proxy. I think obviously the per caps in the category in Mexico
is much more developed than Brazil. We saw very strong performance in 2013 in
Brazil, it was really one of the highlight markets I think across PepsiCo.
And the playbook that we have been bringing to the Brazilian market again is lifting
and shifting some learning from Mexico. We spent time really focusing our portfolio,
in some cases rationalizing our portfolio. We brought very select innovation to the
market that has been very well received.
We've really expanded from being a salty snack player in Mexico to a broader macro
snack player with the acquisition of Mabel and now the introduction of Quaker
cookies and other products that we brought down from our portfolio in Mexico. So
we launched a brand called Toddy that has been incredibly successful in Chile and
Argentina and now in Brazil. Big focus on productivity and really making sure that we
reﬁne our supply-chain and get ready for growth.
And we've spent a tremendous amount of time really reﬁning our go to market
systems. So the Brazilian story in 2013 is really a back to basics story. We reﬁned our
focus on core brands, we brought very select innovation to the market including a
successful launch of Lay's at the end of the year which is oﬀ to a great start in Brazil.
We've really dialed up our focus on getting our supply-chain capabilities in place to
support the future growth and we stepped back and really rewired our go to market
systems. And the prospects in Brazil despite the economic headwinds for us I think
are very strong because of the price point of our products in the Brazilian market.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-20

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantWe bring great value to the consumer. We have signiﬁcant headwinds to capture as
we build per caps in salty and across macro snacks. And we are continuing to build
out and reﬁne our go to market systems. So the overall macros in Brazil, as you know,
slow down dramatically across 2013.
And I think we have got to recognize that it's going to be a slow growth market in
2014. But I think we've got the right playbook, I think our brands are well focused
there. We've got select innovation. We are improving our productivity and we are
certainly enhancing our go to market systems.
Thank you. So much. The other question is much broader; it is if you look at the
consumer understandings that you've had in the food business, why is it that in
beverages you are seeing sugared sodas under pressure, juices under pressure, the
apparent health impact of the way people want to live their lives being quite
crushing even on diets. And yet you're performing incredibly well in the food side.
Can you help us -- if you've dug into that at all and if you could bring any learnings
to help the beverage business?
{BIO 1841158 <GO>}
Right. And that is certainly the work that is underway right now. I think if we step back
and we do talk about what is happening in the LRB environment, there are clearly
still pockets of growth. We have talked about what is happening with categories like
tea and coﬀee, what is happening in sports and sparkling water. What is happening
in ﬂavored CSDs.
We certainly recognize right now if you look at LRB the challenge has been not just
CSDs, it's really the challenge with colas. And part of that is sugar, part of it is the
pressures we are seeing across the diet side of cola as consumers express even
more concerns with artiﬁciality.
So we've been very public about the work we are doing on sweeteners and really
looking at the next generation of sweeteners. We think that is a key unlock. But we
certainly think there is growth across LRB. And as we take the demand space work
we need to understand how to separate those brands and drive growth across tea
and coﬀee in sports and other non-carbs, continue to maximize great brands like
Mountain Dew, which still have tremendous runway.
Then really step back and think about through price pack management, the right
form function, how do we continue to ﬁnd pockets of growth for CSDs including
cola. So it is work in progress, it is certainly a challenge. But we are putting resources
and attention against that. We are certainly committed to ﬁnding a way to optimize
the growth in those categories.
We've got time for one more, over to John. And then Tom and Brian are going to be

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participanthallway.
Thanks. A couple of quick questions on GES. So you have got four facilities up
already, the results seem to be solid. And I guess what is the -- is there a bottleneck
in terms of accelerating this if you are getting more top-line and more savings.
Then the second question would be can you talk to us about what is really
generating the top-line? Is it better out of stocks, is it better servicing of individual
customer demands? Then whatever color you can give us on the beverage aspect of
this that you are looking at in terms of particularly channels, which channels your
thinking about going in beverages? Thanks.
{BIO 15063682 <GO>}
Well GES is really exceeding the hurdle rates, we are very excited about the
performance and the four sites and each time we start one up it gets better. So there
is a learning curve that we are building there.
The reason why two a year is kind of the pace that we have been on, John, is just our
ability to manage the change inside the organization and managing capital and
spending judiciously. So that is really it. I mean we have got -- we start to really see a
ramp up here in terms of the returns on this over time because there is an upfront
investment associated with it obviously. But very excited about it.
The top-line piece, we have studied the future in extraordinary detail. And we sort of
back cast our world from 2020 and really gotten focused on how do we sustain the
growth that we need to go get. And we know those drivers, innovation, execution
and brand building all need to play a role.
So each one of those has played roughly an equivalent role, to be blunt, in the last
year. We measured this rigorously, we have got a crack analytic team that looks
across the whole portfolio every quarter and deconstructs our growth. And
innovation, brand building and execution were all around the same level.
And that is kind of where we want to be because trade spending, promotional
spending, those types of things we won't to be able to sustain, we are very conﬁdent
when we drive the growth the right way through innovation and execution and
brand building.
Well I think that is all the time we have. I want to thank PepsiCo again for the snacks
and drinks this week and your longtime support of the conference. Thank you.
