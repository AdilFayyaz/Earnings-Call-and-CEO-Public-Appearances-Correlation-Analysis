Why don't we get started? I'm going to start with disclosures, both Morgan Stanley
and Facebook disclosures. Please note that all important disclosures, including
personal holdings disclosures and Morgan Stanley disclosures, appear on the
Morgan Stanley public website at MorganStanley.com/researchdisclosures or at the
registration deck.
And now for the Facebook disclosure. Before we get started, on behalf of Facebook,
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that during the course of the chat,
David may make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the
business strategy or prospects of Facebook. Facebook cautions you to consider the
important risk factors that could cause actual results to diﬀer materially from those in
the forward-looking statements. These risks factors are described under the caption
Risk Factors in Facebook's annual report Form 10-K, ﬁled with the SEC on February 1,
2013.
In addition, please note that any forward-looking statements that David makes in this
chat are based on assumptions as of today. And Facebook undertakes no obligation
to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. I've never
done that before. So thank you. That's complicated.
David, welcome. Very happy to have David Ebersman with Facebook. Spent 15 years
in the biotech industry previously. And I think it is a very interesting conversation.
This is David's ﬁrst public appearance at a conference since becoming a public
company. And I think probably the best way to start oﬀ is let David give an overview
of the business. And we will dig into questions.

Page 2 of 19Okay. Great. First of all, thank you, Scott, for including us and giving us this
opportunity. And thanks to everyone for coming. We appreciate your interest.
As you well know, Facebook, our mission is to build products that make the world
more open and connected. And I think if you think about the ﬁrst nine years of the
Company's history, what we've succeeded in doing is to build the foundation, some
really important building blocks for what we are trying to achieve as a Company.
The most important pieces of the foundation, the most important building blocks for
us are really two things. The ﬁrst is the network of people who use Facebook and
their level of engagement and activity with us. So at the end of last year, we had over
1 billion people around the world who are active users of Facebook. On an average
day in December, over 600 million people came to Facebook to connect with their
friends, share photos and news, discover what's going on in the lives of people that
they care about. And that usage and that activity and that engagement really sets us
up and drives everything that we are trying to do.
The second building block for Facebook is the social graph that has been created by
our users. Every time someone comes to Facebook, makes a connection with
someone else, likes a business or a place or a product, that helps us build out what
we call our map of the social graph, which is a representation of all the connections
that exist between people and places and things. And having that map, having that
representation, gives us something that we can really use to build new and better
experiences for people.
If you think about Facebook's priorities in 2013 and going forward, we are really
focused on trying to build upon those blocks, create new kinds of experiences that
take advantage of the assets that we have today.
And our priorities are really centered in three areas right now. So the ﬁrst area is
trying to build out the mobile experiences that we oﬀer to users. We are fortunate
today to have a large number of mobile users; almost 700 million people access
Facebook from their mobile devices as of the end of last year. And in 2012, we
succeeded in making our mobile products faster and more reliable, which
encouraged people to use them more.
But we imagine that we are just getting started in terms of our journey in trying to
build the most engaging, the most valuable and useful mobile products. And as we
think about 700 million people and growing who have Facebook in their pocket on a
device that has a camera and location services and all of the other powerful
technologies that are embedded into your phone, we imagine that there is much
more to what we can oﬀer our consumers in the future.
The second key priority for Facebook is to build new kinds of experiences that take
advantage of the social graph and the network that we have. And those experiences
will be either built by Facebook or built by third-party developers using our platform.
An example of the kind of new experience that we want to bring forward is ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-27
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)
Page 3 of 19Scott Devitt
David EbersmanGraph Search product that we announced earlier this year and are in the process of
slowly rolling out.
So Graph Search enables you to come to Facebook and query the social graph for
the kinds of connections and information that might be of interest to you. So places
your friends have been to, photos of a person or of several people together,
restaurants that your friends might have liked in a certain city, et cetera. So
information that is available to you on Facebook. But prior to us launching this
product is really hard to get at and hard to ﬁnd, that we want to put at your ﬁngertips
so that you can have a diﬀerent kind of search experience that is complementary to
the other things that already exist.
So the third priority for the Company is to continue to invest in our monetization
products and to bring forward new ways to help businesses to reach their
consumers and to communicate with them and market their products and promote
their oﬀerings to them.
So an example of a product that we launched recently that we think is an interesting
and important one for us is the mobile app Install Ad product. So we imagined that
in the future, more and more of the time you spend is going to be on mobile
applications, learning about information, connecting with people consuming. And
developers, as they build these apps, one of their core challenges is ﬁguring out
how do we get the apps to be discovered, how do we put them in front of people so
that the consumer audience knows what we've built and has an opportunity to try it?
Since consumers come to Facebook to discover what's going on in the world around
them and to learn more about things that are interesting to them, promoting an app
within Facebook makes a lot of sense to us as a really good product opportunity for
developers and for users. We launched this product last year and are already seeing
good traction in terms of interest from developers around the world.
So I hope that gives you a sense for what we are working on now. We feel like as a
Company we are very pleased with what we've built to date, where we are and how
we are positioned. But we are still very early in the journey of what we are trying to
build and what we are trying to accomplish. And are excited about the opportunities
that are in front of us in 2013 and beyond.
With that, why don't we turn to questions?
{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
You did such a good job, I don't have anything left. So we're done.

David Ebersman{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
I'll get through it easier the second time. One thing I think is interesting that is -- I
was on the Facebook page. Cheryl posted something of a visit that Facebook
executives did to Wal-Mart. I saw you in the picture. And I think it is interesting
because, one, it highlights what you're doing with larger advertisers potentially; and
two, it also highlights the culture of the Company that you are trying to build at
Facebook. So maybe let's start there and touch on those two topics.
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
Great. So last year, Wal-Mart invited the Facebook leadership team to pay a visit to
Bentonville, which we were thrilled about and eagerly accepted. Really, there were
two purposes for the visit, both of which were really fun and interesting for us.
The ﬁrst was to get to know one of our best advertising clients. So Wal-Mart has
been a company that for the last several years has really tried to be forward-looking
in thinking about the importance of Facebook to their consumers and how they want
to be part of the conversation on Facebook. And they've been, I think, better than
many other companies at, for example, creating advertising products that really work
in the Facebook context, that feel like an interesting Facebook newsfeed post. And
not like the ad that they would be showing on some other piece of media that they
just brought to Facebook.
So we wanted to go and acknowledge the team that has been so forward-leaning in
terms of how they invest with Facebook. But also, it's very important to them as Wal-
Mart thinks about who their suppliers and their partners are, they want people to
understand Wal-Mart, who they are, what they care about, what their objectives are.
The better we understand that, the better we can support them. And hopefully
encourage them to just spend more money with us from an advertising standpoint
over time. So it was a really helpful meeting in just understanding what Wal-Mart
cares about, who they are, et cetera.
But the second part of part of the meeting that in some ways was even more eye-
opening for me was just to get a sense for how strong the culture is at Wal-Mart, how
they've succeeded in building this very large company, where, as far as I could tell,
every employee really has a very clear connection to what Wal-Mart is trying to do
and what values they care the most about.
And at a company like Facebook, which is a very mission-centric company, a
company that really is trying to build something that is sustainably great as a service,
as a business, as a place to work, we'd aspire to build the kind of culture that is as
connected to our values and what we care about as Wal-Mart has done. So learning
from them, getting a sense for what some of the activities they've undertaken are to
try and build that, was really both inspiring and very educational for us. And a really
worthwhile trip.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-27

David Ebersman{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
You've talked a bit historically about the focus that you take in terms of the products
that you create. And recently, it seems like the products that you are testing, you're
testing a lot more than you have been. And so maybe talk a little bit about the way
the Company thinks about focusing on product innovation versus attempting to do
many diﬀerent things at one time.
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
I think one of the things that has deﬁned the Facebook culture in our early years has
been a very strong focus on a few things. So I think this really ﬂows directly from
Mark having a very clear vision of what he wanted Facebook to be and what he
wanted to accomplish. And just as important, I think one of the things I was most
impressed by when I ﬁrst met Mark in the Company was how willing he was to say no
to things that he didn't think were the most critical things for us to do in the
immediate term.
So I think Facebook has always had a long list of projects that we thought made
sense, could add value, would be worth investing in. But has taken the sort of
business strategy of picking a smaller number of those projects and trying to do
them really well, rather than trying to do a little bit of everything.
And when we think about the growth of the Company and our success in hiring
people and expanding the R&D capabilities of Facebook, what that has enabled us
to do over time is to go deeper into the list of projects that we think are going to be
valuable for consumers and for advertisers and for developers. But still trying to
recognize that we are better oﬀ doing a more limited number of things and trying to
do them really well, than spreading ourselves too thin.
{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
Back to the advertising side of the business, you have diﬀerent points at which you
touch the consumer in the funnel of advertising, if you will. So when you think about
the brand message that the consumer sees, is there something unique about brand
messaging for advertisers on Facebook relative to other mediums of media?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
I think I would start by saying that we think Facebook has the opportunity to be
valuable to advertisers across the spectrum, regardless almost of what their
objectives are. If it is a brand objective or a direct response objective or a small
business, we think there is ways to use the Facebook platform to further that
marketer's objectives.
But brand advertising is a particularly interesting thing on Facebook, because think
about what brand advertising is. You are trying to introduce your product or service
to a consumer and to get them to better understand a certain message that youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-27
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)
Page 6 of 19Scott Devitt
David Ebersmanhave about it, that the product is high-quality or that it is safe or that it tastes good or
whatever else. And make an association between your product and that message
that will impact a consumer's purchase decision at some point in the future. So that
really is what distinguishes brand messaging from something where you are trying to
get a more immediate action.
So basically inherent in the idea of brand messaging is when the consumer sees it,
they didn't -- they weren't intending to be learning more about Coca-Cola, Procter &
Gamble or whatever else when they saw it, because brand messaging is really
teaching them something that they might not have been thinking that they were
planning to learn about.
And the reason that ﬁts so well into the Facebook experience is when you come to
Facebook as a consumer, you don't generally come to Facebook because you have a
very speciﬁc topic in mind, that you know you're coming to Facebook to learn more
about X. And that is why you are here. You come to Facebook because you're
curious. You want to discover what's going on in the lives of your friends, you're
curious what's going on in the world around you that you might ﬁnd interesting.
So we feel like the delivery of a brand message that we just launched this new
product and here what is interesting about it ﬁts very well into the mindset of the
consumer when they come to Facebook. And are pleased that over time we've been
able to demonstrate not just that brand advertising on Facebook works in terms of
people's ability to recall the messages that they see and to understand the
messages that they heard from the brand advertisers. But ultimately to inﬂuence
purchase behavior that might occur later that day or that week or that month as the
consumer gets themselves in a circumstance where they might act on the message
that they've heard.
{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
The Company has a vision of basically everything on the Internet becoming social
over time. And we talk pretty extensively to those that have integrated through the
API and do pull functionality both on-platform and then pull it into their sites. And
the feedback that we get is it still very early days.
What do you think the points of friction are in terms of really meeting that longer-
term vision of making the entire Internet social. And what are some of the areas you
think are most interesting in terms of Facebook's ability to inﬂuence over the next
two to three years?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
I think our vision in this area is that most of the activities that you undertake online
will be more interesting and fulﬁlling for you if they are personalized to who you are
and what you are interested in and if they are social.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-27

Page 7 of 19Scott Devitt
David EbersmanSo if you can imagine sort of the two extremes here, if you can imagine a website
that exists, that if all of us in this room were to load up and look at, it would have the
exact same information for all of us. So if it is a sports site or whatever else and it has
the exact same story on it. And all you can do is sort of passively read that story, that
is a diﬀerent kind of an experience than if we all were to try and go to the same kind
of sports news site and we each have a piece of news or several pieces of news that
are tailored to the teams that we are interested in. So that is personalizing the
experience so that it taps into who you are and what you care about. It just makes
sense to us that the latter experience will be better than the former one, if done well.
Similarly, what makes the experience social is the ability, when you're there, to
interact with your friends. So if you're reading about something that you ﬁnd
interesting that you know you have friends who would also ﬁnd interesting, your
ability to interact with those people as you're reading it to make the experience
social will make the experience better for you and for them than if it is just a place
where you can go and consume and can't interact at all.
So that is the basis of our vision, is that products that are personalized and social will
just be preferable and more rewarding.
So the challenge of course is building those products. And enabling developers to
tap into the information that we have on Facebook, if they integrate their services
with Facebook. So they can pull information that helps them to personalize the
experience that enables people to connect with their friends when they are using it
in a way that makes the experience more rewarding.
We've been working on this for a couple of years now. It is a hard series of problems.
It is diﬀerent in every industry. Games was the ﬁrst industry that I think really thought
of some very clever and successful ways to integrate personalization and social
interaction into the ﬂow of the game. And we saw that really creates some very
interesting and widely-used gaming experiences that hadn't existed before. And we
are seeing other industries sort of on a vertical-by-vertical basis start to experiment
with how to bring personalization and social behaviors into their experiences to
make them better.
{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
You mentioned Graph Search as a priority over the next year. Talk a bit about that,
where you are in development. And to the extent that you can expand on how many
employees you have focused on this and when you can really see a commercial
beneﬁt from the product.
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
Graph Search is a complicated product. Some of the things that we build at
Facebook can be built by a small number of people in a short period of time. And
Graph Search is not such a product. The challenges inherent in making this product
work well involve really organizing the massive amounts of data that we have inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-27
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)
Page 8 of 19Scott Devitt
David EbersmanFacebook so we understand what it is and can query it quickly and deliver it to you.
And make sure that it passes through all the appropriate privacy protections. So that
you are seeing the information that you're eligible to see and not more than that. So
it is quite a complex technical challenge that will take time for us to build to
accommodate all the use cases that we think could be most interesting and most
rewarding for people.
In terms of monetization of Graph Search, as is generally the case with our eﬀorts in
product development, our focus starts with trying to build products that are useful
and engaging for users. So the priority right now in Graph Search is trying to make
the product useful so that there are queries that you are likely to do and ﬁnd
interesting when you get the results from Facebook. And our belief is that if we can
build products that are useful and drive a lot of querying behavior, that gives us the
opportunity in the future to think about how we can monetize that behavior in a
manner that is good for our business partners, good for Facebook and hopefully
good for the users as well. But that's not the near-term priority in terms of what we
are doing.
{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
It's interesting -- you have such dominant positions pretty much throughout the
globe. In Brazil, though, just in the past two years, the growth of the business has
been substantial. And you overtaken a leader in that market. What has been most
interesting about that experience. And are there other markets like that where there
is signiﬁcant untapped opportunity?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
There have been many markets -- so Facebook, of course, started as a product
available in the United States. And one of the questions many years ago was whether
or not we could bring Facebook successfully to other markets around the world. And
one of the things that made that question particularly interesting was that in many of
those markets, products that resemble Facebook had already cropped up and were
already being utilized.
So Facebook had to go and be, if you will, the second or potentially third entrant in
many of these markets. Brazil is a really good example, where there was a popular
and entrenched competitor when we really tried to enter the market there.
So what we've learned in markets like Brazil where we've been extremely successful
is ﬁrst of all the most important thing is that the product is good, that the features of
the product enable people to have the experience that they want to have. And for it
to be simple and easy for them to use and get the outcomes that they are after. So
the product is, of course, the most important thing in winning out in a country like
Brazil or elsewhere.
The second thing that is interesting is the importance that comes from our ability to
bring the rest of the world to the problem. So one of the things that makes FacebookFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-27
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)
Page 9 of 19Scott Devitt
David Ebersman
Scott Devittattractive to a user in a country like Brazil who is thinking about using it is that you
can connect with the people that you know and are friends with and are interested in
around the world, because Facebook brings that global footprint in a way that most
of our competitors aren't able to do. And I think that has been extremely important
in a number of markets.
Then the third thing that we do is we do spend a fair amount of time trying to ﬁgure
out how we market the product, how we communicate about the product, how we
create the conditions for the kind of viral growth that really makes Facebook
successful. And it's deﬁnitely a part of the secret sauce at Facebook, is really
understanding how we approach a market where we are not the most popular
player yet. And how we try and create the conditions that enable usage to really take
oﬀ and expand exponentially.
Brazil is a really good example of a success story, where we came later and from a
position where we were dramatically smaller than the most entrenched player in that
market. And were successful. And now, Brazil is one of the countries in the world
where we have the most users. It's in the top ﬁve. I'm not exactly sure what number.
That has played out in many other markets. But not all. Some markets have proved to
be harder than others. And we keep working on them.
{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
And Russia is one of those markets, to the extent you can share anything on that
market and how that has been developing.
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
Russia has been, relative to Brazil, a more challenging market for us, where we've
come in. And the entrenched player in Russia, who has a product that looks a lot like
Facebook with some diﬀerent features -- and it's a good product and it has done
well -- has been harder for us to usurp and compete with.
But we keep working on it. And we are growing in Russia. And we have more users
there now than we did a year ago. And we will keep trying to ﬁgure out what the
right set of actions and tactics are to enable us to really try and tip that market and
become the leading player there over time.
{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
And so you touched on -- or I guess I brought up the topic of focus. You touched on
the approach that the Company takes. That can lead to volatility at times in terms of
business performance and in terms of going through product cycles.
How do you as a management team think about managing the volatility of the
business to the extent that that is even part of the discussion? And how do theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-27
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)
Page 10 of 19David Ebersman
Scott Devitt
David Ebersmanproduct cycles that you go through now as a public company potentially diﬀer from
how that may have been as a private company, if at all?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
I think it goes without saying that the business is easier to run if we can reduce the
volatility, if we could get the business on a cycle where product launches were
predictable with a certain periodicity, that that would be easier to manage. It is never
going to actually work like that, because innovation isn't suﬃciently predictable. And
sometimes products move forward more quickly than you expect. Sometimes they
take more time.
And I think the most important thing for us is to recognize that if we build great
products that people really enjoy using and get value from, we're going to be able
to be successful. And that is going to be more important than trying to dictate the
pattern with which those products will be launched.
Having said that, though, mobile experience is a little bit diﬀerent, at least in terms of
the ways we can update the products and the applications that we oﬀer, because we
can get on a cycle with the mobile applications of trying to update them every
month or every two months, et cetera. So a slightly more predictable rhythm for the
smaller kinds of updates that we can bring to the mobile market.
{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
So talk -- I guess this is somewhat on that topic -- about the way that management
thinks about news feed ad integration, both on the desktop and mobile. And
managing the need or preference to monetize end user experience. Then part two
of that question is where you are in the US versus other markets in terms of, without
speciﬁcally talking about ad load. But in terms of monetizing both mobile and
desktop news feed.
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
So news feed, as you know, is a core part of the Facebook experience. So when you
go to Facebook and you load up your homepage, the ﬁrst thing you see generally,
unless you were targeting something speciﬁcally diﬀerent, is going to be your news
feed. And that is the window into the whole product. So it's a really important part of
the discovery process that is your Facebook experience.
So we believed that by putting ads into news feed, we could really create a valuable
opportunity for businesses to market their products and services, because it is the
core part of where your attention is. And particularly on the mobile phone, if you
have an ad product that ﬁts naturally into news feed, we felt like it could be a natural
part of your mobile Facebook experience, as opposed to being an interruption that
would take you to a diﬀerent place and then you would have to come back to.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-27

Page 11 of 19Scott Devitt
David EbersmanSo when we started last year putting ads into news feed, we really felt optimistic that
this would be an ad format that was likely to work well for us. But obviously, didn't
know exactly what the results would look like. We are very pleased with what we've
seen in the early quarters of introducing ads into news feed on both desktop and
mobile. And we are pleased with them in terms of the information we get back, in
terms of the clickthrough rates and the engagement we see on the ads, the impacts
that showing ads have on user engagement and sentiment.
What Mark quoted on the last earnings call, which is a piece of data that we care a
lot about, is one of the things we measure in news feed is the amount of likes that
users put into the system when they see their news feed, with the idea being that if
you like the content you are seeing, we've probably done a pretty good job showing
you content that is interesting to you. And if you don't like anything you see, we may
need to work harder at the algorithm for trying to show you interesting content.
And in the course of last year, all of the optimizations that we made enabled us to
increase the number of likes that we were seeing in news feed by about 50%. And
when we compared users where we'd put ads in news feed to a holdout group, who
we've never shown ads in news feed, we saw that the diﬀerence in likes was just a
couple of %. So really very minor and in the noise, particularly relative to the
substantial increase in likes we've been able to generate through our other
optimizations.
So what we are not seeing is a signiﬁcant impact on user behavior and engagement
with news feed from the presence of those ads.
So as with most of our new products, usually the ﬁrst place they are likely to ramp up
is in the US, because that is where we have the deepest client relationships. And so
ads in news feed really started to ramp up in the US before certain other markets.
But they are really catching up in markets around the world now. And we're seeing
news feed as a valuable and attractive advertising option in most markets around the
world.
{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
Other products that have been discussed lately, some of which that you've begun to
test and others that are earlier-stage, that come to mind are commerce, the
Facebook Exchange, or FBX and then potentially ad network opportunities. I was
wondering if you can just to the extent on some of those you may be able to talk
more than others, your thoughts around those businesses and what Facebook is
trying to achieve in those product categories.
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
Let's start with the middle one, which you described, FBX. And I'm going to just take
it up one level to what the umbrella that we think FBX sort of sits within, which is the
targeting and relevance of advertising on Facebook. So what we are trying to do
over time is to build a system that enables us to show the right ad to the right user,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-27
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)
Page 12 of 19that has the best possible probability that we are giving you a message as a user that
you are going to ﬁnd interesting and are going to engage with.
And over time, we will continue to build and are building and will continue to build
tools to try and improve our ability to show more relevant advertising to each
individual user.
So two products that we launched last year that sort of fall into this category, one is a
product called Custom Audiences. And this is an important product for us, that
allows advertisers to come to Facebook with information they have about their
customers. So if you're a small business and maybe you are a local coﬀee shop and
you collect e-mail addresses of people who come in and participate in your
business, you can then come to Facebook with that list of customers and say, hey,
can you show ads to these people. And since we know the e-mail addresses for
Facebook users and since most people are Facebook users, we have a really high
ability to match that list with our user base. And we can say, yes, we can make sure
we are targeting the message you want to send to those users.
In the context of a larger business, like a business like Target, that has got a much
longer list of customers and more information about them, Target might want to
show certain ads to a segment of their customers who are likely -- who they believe
have purchased sporting goods in the past, or other people have purchased
clothing in the past. And they can use Custom Audience to target the ads they show
on Facebook to the subsets of their customer list.
So we think this is a really interesting way to marry our data and our knowledge
about users with the work that our clients are doing to understand their customers
and what their interests are. And also with third-party data that they might be able to
purchase to weave into this. And you can target your customers and others who have
characteristics like them using Custom Audiences. So that is an example of I think an
important product for us in terms of improving targeting.
FBX is another example that really is more based on your behavior on the Internet.
And the knowledge that third parties might have about where you've been
searching or shopping for or whatever else. So that if you went to a website and
looked at a certain product but didn't purchase it, they can target an ad to you later
when you're on Facebook, to try and get you to come back and revisit a potential
purchase decision of that product. So again, it is a diﬀerent kind of targeting. But in
the same concept.
The other areas that you asked about, commerce, we launched a product last year
called Gifts with the idea being that there is some social behavior on Facebook that
we think should ﬁt naturally into also sending someone a physical or digital good to
support the message that you are giving them. A really obvious example is birthdays.
There is a lot of happy birthday behavior on Facebook, because it is a time when you
reach out to someone and say, hey, happy birthday. So putting the Gifts product into
that ﬂow. So that if you want to, in addition to saying happy birthday, you can sendFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-27

David Ebersmanthe person something to acknowledge their birthday, we feel like is a nice piece of
social commerce that we launched and are working on now.
Your last question was about an ad network, which is something that we don't really
oﬀer today. It could be something that work on in the future. Our priority today is
really trying to bring more advertisers into the system to advertise on Facebook. We
have a tremendous amount of supply in terms of the number of users who have
come, the amount of time they spend with us. And we want to bring that demand
into Facebook to create more competition to show better ads and more valuable ads
to users on Facebook today.
{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
I'm going to ask one more. We should have about 10 minutes or so for questions as
well.
But one thing that stood out to us -- and I don't want to overly compare your
business to Google, because they are very diﬀerent and both very successful. The
magic in Google was the ability to measure the return as the advertiser. This whole
analytics community built up behind Google over time. Google oﬀered analytics
functionality internally. But there is a whole third-party network, including companies
like Omniture, that build up. And it seemed as if, at least in the past year, that that
community hadn't been built up yet around Facebook.
And so as advertisers come and we discuss with them where they are spending their
ad dollars, the measurement functionality is an area that still seems to be lacking. So
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what Facebook is doing in terms of
providing real analytics and then how you think about a third-party community on
top of Facebook.
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
I think the return on investment that we are able to provide to advertisers is a critical
piece of what we are building at Facebook. And to date, much of the eﬀort that
we've put into that has been sort of client-by-client, working individually with a client
who is willing to really spend some time and money to ﬁgure out -- to ﬁnd what their
objectives are and then to work with us and third parties to ﬁgure out how they can
measure the performance of Facebook advertising against those objectives.
Clearly, our ability, both as a ﬁrst party and with third parties, to develop tools that
enable more advertisers to more easily measure the performance of their investing --
of their advertising investments on Facebook is an important thing. And we think will
be a good thing for Facebook, given the positive results we've seen from the
companies we've worked closely with on return.
So I think we're in the early days of seeing a third-party ecosystem emerge, where
people become experts in thinking about how you optimize and measure Facebook
advertising. And to provide that service and that value to advertising clients. I alsoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-27

David Ebersmanthink Facebook is investing more than we have before in trying to provide those
kinds of tools ourselves. So that advertisers can use them to optimize their spend
with us. And I think that's an important area.
{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
We have 11 minutes left. We'll pause and go to audience questions. In the front here,
in the middle.
On monetization between the US market and the global market, at what point -- I
know there is a diﬀerential link [ph] per capita. I understand that. But at what point
will we start to see that narrow -- that gap narrow between the domestic
monetization and the international monetization? Help us understand that path.
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
Well --
(inaudible)
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
What was the last part?
(inaudible)
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
The last part was -- he was asking about monetization per user. So I think in most
ways, where we are today in terms of relative monetization across geographies isn't a
big surprise. If you compare how we do to how -- other companies who have been
successful in terms of -- on the consumer side have done on a relative basis, just
based on the maturity of the ad market. So I think we are probably in a position that
is not dissimilar to what we might have expected.
Having said that, there have been some positive surprises. There are some
developing markets where we were not optimistic that the advertising market would
emerge quickly. We decided to invest in making sure that we grew our user base in
those markets, because we ﬁgured over the long term that was good for the network
and that the advertising markets might emerge over time. And some of them have
pleasantly surprised us in terms of advertising market that you might not have
predicted if you looked at GDP per capita or things like that. So that's good.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-27

David EbersmanOver time, I think the most important driver of that -- drivers of those gaps closing
will of course ﬁrst of all just be the performance of the local economies. But the
second thing will be our ability to generate more advertiser demand in those
markets. What really enables us to ramp up our business in addition to usage is more
competition from advertisers that drives up price over time.
So it's really important to us on a market-by-market basis to have the right strategies
in place so we can encourage more advertisers to believe that the returns they will
get from advertising with Facebook should cause them to dedicate more time and
attention to what they are doing with us.
An example of the kinds of things we do, we've always felt that with small
businesses, because so many small-business owners are Facebook users personally,
they have Facebook accounts, that we have the opportunity to transition them to be
page owners and advertisers by using the product to encourage them to think about
how they interact with Facebook as a person and how that can beneﬁt their
businesses. And we are deﬁnitely seeing not just in the US. But around the world,
really nice growth in usage of the pages product and the advertising system by small
businesses.
I wonder if you could discuss the health of the network. There is an increasing
amount of competition for your -- I guess your youngest or fastest-moving users,
whether that's Twitter or other media. How do you actually measure that internally?
And I guess in terms of keeping that fresh and vibrant and not turning into MySpace,
what are the factors that you measuring and what are you most concerned about?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
The way we see this market in general is that the market for services that enable you
to connect with other people and to share and to discover information is just a
marketplace that is growing extremely rapidly. It is exploding because the tools are
useful and because it is so much easier technologically than it has ever been before
for you to share information and to ﬁnd information that others are sharing. So there
is more and more of these tools.
We see that as a reﬂection of not only a growing marketplace. But something that is
going to remain important into the future. So we don't expect to have every behavior
from every user. There is going to be other competitors that oﬀer certain kinds of
services that are also used. But we feel very well-positioned because of the size of
the network we are starting with and the knowledge we have about our users.
So let me answer the question about measurement. And then I'll sort of come back
around to what we think is important for us. So the kinds of things that we measure
are of course visitation. So we look at are we growing the number of people who are
active monthly users of Facebook. And then the number of people who are daily
users. And the daily user number continues to rise nicely. And that is a reallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-27
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)
Page 16 of 19Unidentiﬁed Participant
David Ebersmanimportant measurement of the fact that people are ﬁnding Facebook useful and they
are making it a part of their daily routine.
We measure what they do when they visit. So the amount of content that they share,
how many likes that they put into the system, which, again, as I said earlier, is a
reﬂection of the utility that they ﬁnd in the information that is there, the comments
that they leave. How much sharing is occurring through Facebook. And that is an
important metric that also gives us a sense for the health of engagement across the
platform.
The other thing I was just going to describe quickly that I think is an interesting
competitive advantage for us is what we are trying to do with the services we oﬀer to
each one of our users is we are trying to personalize the content you see in a manner
that you will ﬁnd most interesting. So of all the information we are able to show you
on Facebook, we are trying algorithmically to pick out which pieces of content to put
at the top of your news feed because we think you will ﬁnd them most engaging.
And every time you come to Facebook and interact with the content we provide you,
you are giving us the chance to make our algorithms a little bit smarter about who
you are and what you ﬁnd interesting.
And we have now -- for our oldest users, we have nine years of training in terms of
information from them and nine years of experience trying to ﬁgure out how to
optimize these algorithms, that really help us to operate within a world where we
have so much more information ﬂowing through the system. And to choose the
information that's going to be most interesting to you and that we can present to
you. I think that is going to be a core part about -- our ability to do that well will be
core to our ability to continue to have engaged users, even as they contemplate
other services that come up.
The only other thing I should mention in the context of the question is one of the
services that is, I think, a quite formidable competitor is Instagram, which has grown
extremely rapidly and now has over 100 million active users. And that is a product
that of course -- or as company that we purchased last year as a complement to the
photo-sharing that already existed on Facebook.
Thinking diﬀerently about the monetization, the value of the information you have is
a directory for businesses to reach out to their customers. So businesses spend tens
of billions of dollars a year to get databases of e-mails. If you can make e-mails
obsolete, how do you reach out to those customers and translate that into the
business side --?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
I think that we have for essentially since we started with advertising oﬀered
advertisers diﬀerent opportunities to try and reach out to segments of Facebook's
consumer base that resembled our customers. So people who like skiing or peopleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-27
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)
Page 17 of 19Scott Devitt
Unidentiﬁed Participant
David Ebersmanwho live in a certain city or people who've connected to a certain kind of music. So
the opportunity for you to think about what do you think your customer base looks
like and how do you use the information in Facebook to target is a core part of what
we've oﬀered for a long time.
The new products that I mentioned earlier really are an attempt to bring diﬀerent
kinds of targeting information to that conversation. So that if there is a business that
has accessed that third-party site to get list of e-mail addresses that for some reason
they think are relevant to them, they can e-mail those people. They can do that
directly. Which will have some utility. But you know, e-mail has a lot of spam and it
may not be the most eﬃcient way to reach that group.
But with Custom Audiences, you could now take that e-mail list and we can match, as
much as possible, to those people. And then we can show them ads across devices.
We can also try and target people who have characteristics that look like them. So
that if you given us an e-mail list that is heavy -- heavily represented by people who
might live in a certain city or like a certain kind of activity, we can then further target
to people who may not be on the e-mail list you gave us. But who have
characteristics that suggest they might have similar interests.
So really pulling that together in a way that is -- that works well and is robust I think is
one of the most important opportunities we have to make monetization work better
on Facebook.
{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
Any other questions?
When you look at the domestic news feed mobile ads, where are we in terms of
volume that you can ﬁll right now? When I look at my own feed, I probably see two
or three ads every time I pull it up. I'm trying to imagine what it looks like at six or
seven -- how do you guys think about that?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
I don't think we have a predetermined answer for where this journey takes us in
terms of that metric. We are relatively new to the game of trying to understand what
news feed ads look like and how to optimize them.
As I said before, I think the most encouraging data point that we have today is the
lack of negative impact that we've seen or meaningful negative impact that we've
seen from the ad loads we have today.
As I think about what the future looks like, I think it is really hard to separate out
quantity from quality. I think the better the ads are, the more of them we can show,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-27

David Ebersmanwithout having a negative eﬀect on the user experience on Facebook. So our ability
to work with clients to help them understand how to create better-targeted and
more engaging news feed ads I think will enable us to show more of them.
So a good news feed ad in my mind is an ad that looks like the other content in news
feed. It resembles the ﬂow and feel of the posts that your friend made that is above it
and the post that comes below it from a family member. And I think a news feed ad
that is likely to be of lower quality is one that really just sort of takes a message and
sort of shoves it in front of you in a way that is not as engaging and interesting and
involved as the other posts that you might see around it in news feed.
So I think we are still early in the process of our clients learning and understanding
what good newsfeed advertising looks like. And I think if they are able to move up
that learning curve, that also helps us a lot.
{BIO 4757000 <GO>}
One last question. If there is none, we will go back to the front.
David, this question is about engagement and the next generation of users. Number
one, how comfortable are you that you are capturing the mindshare of the younger
generation that is entering college, that they are becoming Facebook users? And
talk to us about what you guys are doing with Instagram, where I think there is a lot
of younger people using that service. And how are they migrating to a Facebook
environment?
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
I think it is -- we just completed the Instagram purchase some number of months ago
and are still really -- that team is still really focused on just growing usage, as
opposed to -- those are very interesting questions, in terms of how Instagram relates
to Facebook in terms of the same users and how they use them. We don't have
answers yet.
What we do know is that Instagram is already a very popular service that continues
to go grow rapidly. And we believe, based on the information that we have, that it's
quite popular among the kinds of users that you're asking about, the younger
generation.
It is very important for Facebook to build products that are useful to those users and
to build products that they feel comfortable they can have a good experience with.
So deﬁnitely high on the list of priorities for us. Facebook is a very young company in
terms of the age of our employees. And I am hopeful that continues to be an asset
for us in terms of having our ﬁnger on the pulse of what matters to that particular
constituent of users and how we can provide products that satisfy them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-27

I'm going to squeeze one last one in and we'll close, which is the extension of
payments. You've got users, you have sites connected to Facebook, the potential of
really opening up payments as a solution in the way that PayPal is over time.
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
I think that the payments product we oﬀer today is used for the purpose of virtual or
digital goods through our platform partners primarily. And to some degree, directly
from Facebook's oﬀerings. I think that payments will evolve based on the use cases
we can identify, where there is an opportunity for us to bring something forward that
satisﬁes the needs that people have. So if we can ﬁgure out a way to make payments
enable, in particular, developers, I would say, is sort of the most obvious constituent,
better monetize what they've built in their services, we're going to be interested in
doing that. But it will really follow, I think, a compelling use case.
