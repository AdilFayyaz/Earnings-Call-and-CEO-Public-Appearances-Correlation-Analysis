Presentation
{BIO 20961201 <GO>}
Okay, ﬁrst, I got to take a picture real quick. What a group. Hang on. All right. All
right. Everyone's looking sharp and then one of the Board, right? All right. Cheese. 1,
2, 3. There we go. I could do a selﬁe, too. But let's not.
I appreciate that. All right. As a reminder, if you haven't voted by proxy or would like
to change your vote, you may do so by picking up a ballot at the table. The table's
back there, the corner over there. Once you've completed the ballot, please hand it
to Lisa Brenten. Lisa, can you please raise your hand? There's Lisa. She's over by the
table over there -- of Computershare, she's our inspector of elections.
What I'd like to do is, ﬁrst, welcome Robyn Denholm, our Chair. She's going to give
us some opening remarks.
{BIO 5964382 <GO>}
Thanks, Jonathan. Welcome. Good afternoon to everybody joining us here live in the
auditorium here but also online. So thank you. Following the formal part of the
presentation or some might say, the more normal or boring part of the presentation,
Elon will join us to actually go through a presentation as well, which I'm sure all of
you are looking forward to.
In addition, I'd like to thank and note several people that are in the audience. Our
Board is in the audience. So many members of the Board are here. And I'd also likeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 2 of 31Jonathan A. Changto mention the number of executives from Tesla, are also here in the room as well.
I'm sorry. I promised myself I would not do that today. And ﬁnally, Kevin Healy from
PricewaterhouseCoopers is here, Tesla's independent auditor, is in the room today.
So after the voting, as I said, Elon will give a presentation about Tesla and answer
questions. So the Q&A is always a highlight of the stockholders' meeting.
But I would like to start today's meeting by thanking you, our investors, our
shareholders, for the tremendous support that you've given Tesla not just over the
last 12 months. But also over the last many years. Without you, the progress that
we're making as a company towards the mission of moving the world towards
sustainable energy would not have been -- would not have happened. When you're
changing the world and many industries in the process, you need to have a certain
amount of intestinal fortitude as an investor. And when I speak to many of you, our
shareholders, you have that in spades. So thank you.
I am incredibly honored to be your Chair. And when I sit back and look at what the
company's achieved, in particular over the last year, with GAAP proﬁtability for the
second half of 2018 and over 245,000 vehicles delivered, 245,000, ﬁve years ago,
that would have just been a dream. And also, over 1 gigawatt hour of energy storage
deployed in 2018, breaking ground in Shanghai and many, many other
achievements. I also take stock at this time of year to think about what we've
achieved together over the last ﬁve years and over the last 15 years that many of you
have been part of that journey as well. It's truly astonishing what the company has
achieved. It's also easy to lose sight of that on a day-to-day basis. There are many
highlights to come. And the opportunity ahead of us as a company over the next 5,
10 and 15 years is immense. And I want to thank you all for being resilient
shareholders and look forward to speaking to many more of you in the months and
years to come.
I also want to take this opportunity to thank 2 of our fabulous Board members who
are actually not standing for reelection today. They're Brad Buss and Linda Johnson
Rice. Linda has served on our Board for only two years. But it's been a phenomenal
two years through her contribution to us -- not just as a member of the Board but
also an active member of the Compensation Committee. And I'd also like to thank
her for amazingly positive attitude and her insights on many topics. And also Brad
Buss, who preceded me as the Audit Committee Chair and has been on the Board
for almost 10 years. And he's done amazing work across that entire time. His
contributions to the Board have been many. And I can't list them all today. But it's
been awesome to work with him. And we will miss them both.
And so now I'd like to reintroduce Jonathan Chang to go through the formal part of
today's meeting. Thank you.
{BIO 20961201 <GO>}
Thanks, Robyn. Robyn, our new Chair, has been doing some great, amazing work
with our Board and our company. So really appreciate all the work, Robyn.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 3 of 31I am the General Counsel at Tesla. And this starts now the -- I think Robyn referred to
it as the boring part of the meeting. Often in my meetings, she refers to me as the
boring part of the meeting. But -- so this is it. So I'm well suited for it. Okay. Let's get
started by calling the Tesla's Annual Meeting of Stockholders to order. Please refer to
the agenda and the rules of the meeting that were provided for you today.
The time is now 2:39 p.m.. And I declare that the polls are now open. We have
already received, over the past few weeks, voting proxies from our stockholders. And
that means that almost all of the votes that will be counted were already submitted
prior to today -- prior to this meeting.
However, as I mentioned previously, if you wish to submit a ballot to vote your shares
or change your prior vote, please pick one up at the table back in the corner by the
last door over there. And hand it to Lisa Brenten, who's standing there over by the
table, from Computershare, or any of the Tesla personnel collecting ballots. There's
going to be some folks walking around. If you just raise your hand, you can wave
them down with the ballots. I'll give you a few minutes -- few seconds while people
go around and collect ballots here.
Tesla's Board of Directors has appointed Lisa Brenten of Computershare to serve as
inspector of election for this meeting. Lisa has taken and signed an oath as the
inspector of election. Thanks, Lisa.
Computershare has certiﬁed that starting on April 30, 2019, the proxy materials or a
notice of Internet availability of the proxy materials were mailed or provided to all
Tesla stockholders of record as of April 15, 2019. We have a majority of the
outstanding shares represented at the meeting. So I declare that there is a quorum
present and that we may proceed with the meeting.
The items on the agenda are as follows: the ﬁrst proposal, the election of 2 Class 3
directors, Ira Ehrenpreis and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, to serve for a term of three
years or if proposal 5 of our agenda is approved, two years; proposal 2, to approve
Tesla's 2019 Equity Incentive Plan; proposal 3, to approve Tesla's 2019 employee
stock purchase plan; proposal 4, to approve and adopt amendments to Tesla's
certiﬁcate of incorporation and bylaws to eliminate applicable supermajority voting
requirements; proposal 5, to approve and adopt an amendment to Tesla's certiﬁcate
of incorporation to reduce the term length for directors; proposal 6, to ratify the
appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Tesla's independent registered
public accounting ﬁrm for the 2019 ﬁscal year. Tesla's Board has recommended that
our stockholders vote for each of those director nominees and for each of those
proposals that I just listed above.
We have also received 2 stockholder proposals as described in our proxy statement.
The ﬁrst stockholder proposal is an advisory vote to recommend that Tesla establish
a Public Policy Committee. Our Board has recommended that our stockholders vote
against this stockholder proposal. This stockholder proposal is proposed by Mr. JingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11

Oh, he's up with the mic. Please, Mr. Zhao, you have 3 minutes to present your
proposal.
{BIO 20430029 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Good afternoon, fellow shareholders. I will make it very simple
because today's too hot. So I want everybody to enjoy the meeting. Just 1 minute.
Shareholder proposal #7: resolved, shareholders will recommend Tesla establish a
Public Policy Committee to oversee the company's policies, including human rights,
environment, domestic governmental regulation, foreign aﬀairs and the international
relations aﬀecting the company's business. And I especially thank you, fellow
shareholders, voting for my shareholder proposal last year for Independent
Chairman at 16%. I expect you to vote for my proposal today. Again, thank you very
much.
{BIO 20961201 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr. Zhao. I would like to remind our stockholders that Tesla's Board has
prepared a statement in opposition of this proposal, which appears in our proxy
statement.
Finally, we have also received a stockholder proposal for an advisory vote regarding
simple majority voting provisions as described in our proxy statement. Our Board
has recommended that our stockholders vote against this proposal. This stockholder
proposal is proposed by Mr. James McRitchie who is represented here again by Mr.
Jing Zhao to present this proposal. Mr. Jing Zhao, you have 3 minutes.
{BIO 20430029 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Just 1 minute. Same thing before. Proposal #8, simple majority
vote. Resolved: Tesla shareholders request that our Board take each step necessary
so that each voting requirement in our charter and bylaws that calls for a greater
than simple majority vote be eliminated and replaced by a requirement for majority
of the votes cast for and against applicable proposals or a simple majority in
compliance with applicable laws. Thank you very much. I make it very simple. Thanks.
Enjoy.

Page 5 of 31Elon R. MuskGreat. Thank you, Mr. Zhao. I would like to remind our stockholders that Tesla's
Board has prepared a statement in opposition of this proposal, which appears in our
proxy statement.
Are there any proxies remaining in the audience that have not been submitted?
Keep your hands up. And folks will come around and collect those ballots. Please
submit them now if you want them to be counted. No.
Okay. Looks like we have an all clear here. I declare that the polls are now closed.
Based on the proxies that we have previously received, I'd like to announce that our
stockholders have approved the recommendations of the Tesla Board on all agenda
items, except item 4 regarding the elimination of applicable supermajority voting,
requirements in our charter and bylaws and item 5 regarding the reduction of our
director terms. While over 99% of the shares present and entitled to vote on these 2
items did so, as recommended by the Board, unfortunately, less than 2/3 or 66 2/3%,
less than that, of our total outstanding shares, which were required to approve these
items, submitted votes. We will formally announce the results of the voting by ﬁling a
Form 8-K within 4 business days of today's meeting.
All right. That concludes the boring part of this meeting. The oﬃcial business of
today's shareholders' meeting is done, which is now adjourned.
Now I welcome you to stay for the company presentation. We'll have Elon, our CEO,
coming out soon and then for a stockholder Q&A session with Elon as well. During
the course of the session, we may discuss our business outlook and make other
forward-looking statements. Such statements are predictions based on our current
expectations. Actual events or results could diﬀer materially due to a number of risks
and uncertainties, including those disclosed in our most recent Form 10-Q ﬁled with
the SEC. Such forward-looking statements represent our views as of today, should
not be relied upon thereafter. And we disclaim any obligation to update them after
today.
With that, please welcome our CEO, your CEO, Elon Musk.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Hi, everyone. Hello. Hi. thanks for coming. So yes, I think we've got a lot of
interesting news. I think it's going to be, I think, very well received. This -- it's been a
hell of a year. But a lot of good things are happening. And I think it's worth going
over those things.
So Model 3, last 4 quarters, is actually selling -- outselling all competitors combined
in the U.S.. So all of them. It's the highest revenue car in the U.S. and best-in-class
performance. And it's actually the best-selling car by revenue of -- including high-
volume cars like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. So the dollar sales -- yes, I
think most people aren't aware of this. But we're about the fourth best-selling byFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 6 of 31numbers. But the highest selling by revenue over the past year of any, any car in the
U.S. So that's remarkable that an electric vehicle is the best-selling, the highest
revenue car in the country. I think 10 years ago, nobody would have believed it.
Thanks to the hard work of the Tesla team, this is what -- this is the result. It's great.
And as I said, in class, the Model 3 is outselling the Mercedes C-Class, the BMW 3
Series, Audi A4, S4 and the Lexus combined. That's in units. The diﬀerence is higher
in dollars.
So we also have the most energy eﬃcient cars in the world. So this is the EPA miles
per kilowatt hour. And you can see the Model 3 is around 4. And it ranges oﬀ to the
right. I don't want to pick on e-tron. But it's -- there's room for improvement. (foreign
language) If you speak French, that's quite funny.
So the new Model S is a 370-mile range. And you can go -- we actually did this with
the Motor Trend. They drove nonstop from the Bay Area to L.A. Admittedly, that was
downhill sort of -- not really. It feels downhill. But it's not. But on a single charge to
go from the Bay Area to L.A. is pretty wild for any car and especially a full-sized
sedan. Then the new Model X range is 325 miles despite it being a large SUV.
It's worth noting that no car has exceeded -- no electric car has exceeded the range
of the ﬁrst Model S that we came out with in 2012. So -- and yes, resisting the
temptation to pick on competitors. I will not do that. But the -- it's still -- it's a
testament to the Tesla engineering team to be able to have made a car seven years
ago that has still not been exceeded in range. And now to have a car that's 370 miles
and with steady improvements that are likely occur over the next few years. It won't
be long before we have a 400-mile range car. Yes.
So we get this question a lot. And it's -- I want it clear, there is not a demand
problem, okay? Absolutely none. The sales are -- have far exceeded production. And
production's been pretty good. So we're actually doing well. And we have a decent
shot at a record quarter on every level. If not, it's going to be very close. But we've
got a shot at a record quarter. And 90% of orders are coming from nonreservation
holders. So these are new customers.
Model 3 market potential when we see trade-ins, 63% of the trade-ins are
nonpremium cars, which means people are trading up to buy the Model 3. And yes,
12% are midsized sedans, 25% other premium vehicles. But it's just interesting that
the supermajority essentially of the cars that are being traded in are nonpremium. So
it's just -- this is a lot of potential.
And when people look at the -- when people look at total cost of ownership, the
actual total cost of ownership, because electricity is so much cheaper than gasoline
and the maintenance costs are much less, you don't need an oil change or a ﬁlter
change. You basically never need to change the brake pads because of regenerative
braking. The actual operating costs of an electric car are much less than a gasoline
car. And so it takes a while for -- to educate people on this because the easiest thingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 7 of 31to look at is just the lease price or the purchase price. But the -- when factoring in
fuel and maintenance, the -- it's actually -- buying Model 3 is like buying a Camry or
an Accord but better, yes, better from a cost standpoint, yes. It's a great car. It's a car
that is designed for you to have the most fun. And we keep putting gems on it like
the fart app. Of course, that's one of my favorites. It's like perhaps my ﬁnest work.
The Autonomy Investor Day, that I think was well received. The Tesla full self-driving
computer is literally 20x faster -- 21x faster than the NVIDIA system that it replaces.
And we expect to be feature complete with autonomy by the end of this year. So
you'll still need to supervise the autonomy. But it should be able to go from your
garage to your parking space at work without intervention. So then we'll obviously
put on billions of miles of testing. Then I think probably sometime next year, you'll
be able to have the car be autonomous without supervision. And then sometime
thereafter, we'll be able to convince the regulators that the autonomy is safe enough
that the car could actually go around with no one in it.
And it's really the critical elements for that are having billions of miles of testing,
ultimately tens of billions of miles. So having a huge ﬂeet, having a very powerful AI
inference engine. That's the Tesla full self-driving computer and then having the
sensors in the car that are necessary for the car to drive, like it would be cameras in
all directions, radar, ultrasonics, a good IMU, GPS, that kind of thing.
So I think we've laid the groundwork here for a ﬂeet that essentially every car made
since October '16 is capable of full autonomy, in our view, with replacement of the
computer alone. So you just need to switch out the computer. I think a lot of people
were puzzled as to how could I say that we will have 1 million robotaxis by the end of
next year. And it's -- if you sum up the vehicles made since October '16 and
essentially switch out the computers for the ones that were made after the full self-
driving computer a few months ago, the -- we will have 1 million cars that are capable
of self-driving. We'll still need regulatory approval. But the capability will be there.
And this massively increases the value of the car. So in fact, I think it's basically
ﬁnancially insane to buy anything except an electric car that is upgradable to
autonomy. It's just nuts. You can see one country after another is putting dates on
banning gasoline and diesel cars. And the environmental pressure to move away
from fossil fuels is getting stronger and stronger. So it's just basically mad to buy a
fossil fuel car at this point because its long-term resale value will be less and less.
Then it's also important to buy a car that is upgradable at least to full self-driving
because a car that cannot do self-driving will also be not worth not very much. I've
made this comment before. But like, essentially, if you buy a gasoline car that's not
full self-driving, it's like riding a horse and using a ﬂip phone. I'm like, hello, not wise.
So it's really -- it takes us a bit of time to educate consumers about this. But I think
people are starting to get it.
And like a car is a major investment for most people. It's often their most valuable
asset. If you're going to make the choice about your most valuable asset, you want to
look towards the future and say, where are we headed? Clearly, we're headedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11

Page 8 of 31Jeﬀrey B. Straubel
Elon R. Musk
Jeﬀrey B. Straubeltowards electriﬁcation. Clearly, we're headed towards autonomy. And so that's the
kind of car you want to get. So I think this is -- people are starting to realize this.
Then with the Model Y, the -- this is the biggest segment of vehicles in the world.
There's the midsized SUV. It's 2.5x bigger than the Model 3 market. And so we think
probably demand for Model Y will be greater than the S, 3 and X combined. And we
put a lot of eﬀort into the eﬃciency of the car, getting incredibly lower drag
coeﬃcient. And I think we might be able to get the drag coeﬃcient actually lower
than the 3, which will be -- is quite unusual. And the car has a lot of room inside. It's I
think like a good sense of design or a good design principle is if the car looks
bigger -- it feels bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside, that is a good
design. So this car is actually quite big on the inside.
Then we expect to hit volume production towards the end of next year. Internally,
we're aiming for sooner than that. But we want to have some margin on that timing.
So yes.
I still ﬁnd it crazy that we have this Gigafactory. That used to be just rocks, rocks and
bushes. And I remember -- so where's J.B. and Drew? Hi, guys. Actually, do you guys
want to come up and join for a second? Yes? Yes. Yes, I think it'd be good to maybe
talk about the Gigafactory. And I remember when we were like doing calculations for
battery capacity and we're like, we need more batteries than all of Earth is currently
producing. So it's -- unless we build this thing, that's not going to happen. So yes, I
mean, maybe you tell the story...
{BIO 16619298 <GO>}
Sure. Well good to see everyone. Hello. It -- yes, it was a pretty crazy story. And Elon
and I were just talking about it recently. And it's sort of amazing how some really
simple kind of napkin math could lead to such kind of outrageous result. I mean as
he just said, we basically did the quick math and looked at, okay, we're going to
build 100,000 cars per year and this many kilowatt hours per car therefore,
therefore, 35 gigawatt hours of cells per year. Well that's a huge number. And it was
actually more than the entire world was producing for all applications, cell phones,
computers, cars, everything, just a few years before that. So that was what kind of
shocked us and said, wow, we -- this isn't going to work unless we build an entire
new facility to solve this ourselves.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. We probably have to get all the battery factories in the world. So therefore, we
better build this. And yes, I mean the crazy thing is this was basically, I think, 5 slides.
And we showed a picture of a factory in the hills and said to investors, we need
money to build this thing. And they gave us money, which was cool.
{BIO 16619298 <GO>}
And we built it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11

Page 9 of 31Elon R. Musk
Jeﬀrey B. Straubel
Elon R. Musk{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, yes. We built it. There it is, right there. It's really giant. And it's getting bigger. So
we're -- we have about 35 gigawatt hours of capacity potential at Giga right now.
And then we're about sort of 70% or 80% of that capacity has been realized. So I
think there was a bit of confusion earlier this year because Panasonic said there was
35. And there's technically yes. But it was not 35 at max capacity yet. But it will be,
probably, I don't know, end of this year or next -- or early next. So...
Then it's also lowest cost per kilowatt hour. It's half of all global EV battery
production. So you add up all the EV -- all electric vehicles in the world, all the
batteries that they use, that's approximately equal to what we make at the
Gigafactory.
{BIO 16619298 <GO>}
And maybe just a quick shout out to the whole team out there and the team that's
made that happen. I mean it's been such an epic project. I mean as you said, starting
with dirt, literally dirt in the desert, to now the biggest battery factory in the world.
And it took thousands and thousands of people to do it. Kevin had a huge part in
that, sitting there. So yes, it's pretty amazing watching that happen. And I feel super
proud to be part of that team.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. It was -- so and then we're making good progress on the Gigafactory in
Shanghai. If you've watched the progress online, it gets followed with an
excruciating detail. I think the number of drones ﬂying over the factory is pretty nutty.
We need air traﬃc control. So -- but the shell of the building is basically done at this
point. It's -- I think this might be the -- it's the fastest large factory construction that
I've ever seen. And maybe there's something faster. But I'm not aware of it because
this is amazing. And we're already installing a lot of the factory equipment, the
stamping machines. We'll begin installing a paint shop and the factory module lines,
that kind of thing. So this will be obviously extremely important to our future
because China is the largest electric car market in the world. And to date, we have
had to pay import duties. Some of those quite signiﬁcant ones, ranging from 15% to
40%, which -- and we did not have access to local incentives because those were
only if you make the car in China.
Now the local incentives are going away I think approximately when our factory
starts. But I think this is a coincidence. But at least we will not have the cost of the
import duties. And we will -- it will cost less to make the car in China. So we'll be able
to have a more aﬀordable car for the China market. So this is extremely important to
Tesla's future.
Then Gigafactory Europe, as you can see, we've made great progress here. We just
put this picture in like literally 5 minutes ago. So this is deep planning here. This is
not the actual place that it will be. This is a generic picture of Europe.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11

Yes, lovely.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Put the factory there.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think it may be near Hamburg or something. But we're still looking at what the right
place is to put the Gigafactory Europe. Hopefully, we'll make that decision towards
the end of this year. And it also makes sense to have a car factory at least on each
continent. This is a wise move. We'll continue to expand, I think, our activity in the
U.S.. But having to not pay tariﬀs and have the really long delivery chain and high
transport costs will make the cars a lot more aﬀordable to people in Europe and in
China. So yes, we're looking forward to making decision on this, hopefully, towards
the end of this year.
And Tesla Energy, we're looking at probably at least doubling energy storage growth
for Powerwall and Powerpack compared to 2018. Internally, we have a bigger goal
than that. But I think we can at least double it. And so it will be at least sort of on
order of 2, maybe approaching 3 gigawatt hours. And we're installing the Solar Roof
in 8 states. We're about to complete Version 3 of the Solar Roof. So this is actually
quite a hard technology problem to have an integrated solar panel -- or solar cell
with the roof tile and have it look good and last for 30 years. Like roofs have to last a
long time. So the -- it's -- the amount of testing that one has to do and do
accelerated life testing to say how can we predict what -- how this will perform if we
just spend six months of testing and project that out to 30 years. So it's quite a hard
problem and then making it easy to install, getting the cost low. But I'm really excited
about Version 3 of Solar Roof. And it's -- and I'm not really over conﬁdent on this. But
I think that we can -- we have a shot at being equal to a (comp) shingle roof plus
someone's utility costs or being maybe lower than that. So that's like one of the
cheapest roofs available. So you can have potentially a great roof out with better
economics than a normal, fairly cheap roof and your utility bill.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11

So Drew joined my team when it was a tiny, tiny team. There were like 5 or 10 of us or
something a couple of years after the company got started. And he's been trying to, I
don't know, my right-hand person, involved in almost every key initiative that I've
done at the company through that whole tenure. And I think you're super amazing.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I agree.
{BIO 16619298 <GO>}
I do think you guys should see more of Drew. And you've been involved in a lot of
stuﬀ and are still leading a lot of key initiatives for us. So anyway, introduction to

Elon R. MuskThank you, J.B. Yes, super glad to be here, talk about a lot of our core technology
areas that we've been focused on over the years. And yes, just thanks for introducing
me, J.B.
{BIO 16619298 <GO>}
You're welcome.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. So yes, I mean Drew and his team have been really key to a lot of the powertrain
innovations, factory innovations and Solar Roof and a number of other things. So it's
quite a pleasure having those engineering discussions.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Mutually -- the feeling is mutual.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
All right. Cool. Love you, too, bro.
So we got the Version 3 Supercharger. There's actually like the scope of technology
that is advancing at Tesla is really massive on many fronts. So as mentioned, we've
got Version 3 of the Solar Roof coming out soon. We've got Version 3 of the
Supercharger that's being deployed around the world. And this is 75 miles in 5
minutes capability, 250-kilowatt system. If -- I'm sure a lot of you have used the
Superchargers before. And they've typically been anywhere from 75 kilowatts to -- if
you've used one recently, you might have gotten up to 140 kilowatts. But that's the
Version 2. Then Version 3 is 250 kilowatts.
And when 250 kilowatts are charging a really eﬃcient car, the miles per minute is
super good. In fact, I think there was recently a test with -- I'm not sure who it was.
But tested like what car could charge the most number of miles in half an hour. It was
the Model 3. That's -- yes. So...
Then we'll be publishing new maps for this Supercharger deployment. And we're
ﬁnally going to get the Trans-Canada Highway and -- for example...
Alaska?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Then, we're going to go Alaska, too. So yes, actually, the -- this map doesn't even
include all of the locations. But really like the 2 critical factors we found for sales inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 13 of 31any given region and the really obvious actually are: is there a service center within
reasonable distance and are there Superchargers on all the routes that you'd like to
take? You don't want to have like (80%) of the routes because then like, geez, what
about that 1 trip that you can't do now? So you really want to have Superchargers
and service centers, are the absolute key to sales. And really, we can map our sales
to -- like basically people are just like sensible. They're like, "Okay, you need to
service your car and you need to be able to travel conveniently on long-distance
routes." And so where we've got that, we -- our sales are good. We also have to have
good consumer ﬁnancing and make sure our pricing is competitive. But it's -- as
soon as people see that, they buy the cars. It's pretty straightforward.
Yes. And so we'll be expanding the Supercharger network quite substantially over
time and also enabling Tesla to use other high-speed charging networks. So you
have like adapters for that. And the key is, like when you buy a car, you're buying
freedom, freedom to travel. Then -- and so you must have the Superchargers. You
must have high-speed charging. Then if the car breaks, it must be ﬁxed quickly.
I'm actually really excited about our Mobile Service. So we have Mobile Service vans
that will come ﬁx your car as soon as it breaks down. It actually will immediately send
a note to Tesla Mobile Service and will be on its way to ﬁx the car. And so we're
actually -- we trialed it in the Bay Area and now have extended it to the L.A. area and
a number of others for tire repair. So we'll just come -- the van will arrive, give you a
new tire in half an hour. And you're on your way. It's like -- it makes a huge
diﬀerence.
So that's -- and we're adding things like bumper repair and minor like collision
repair. So if I look at the things that most trouble customers, it's things like collision
repair taking an eternity. And then third-party body shop charging an arm and a leg
after taking an eternity. So we're moving a lot of the body repair in-house at Tesla
and then even providing it on Mobile Service. And we just did our ﬁrst bumper
replacement from Mobile Service van. So like typically, a collision repair can take
weeks or months. In this case, it took less than an hour, yes. So...
That's right, cyberpunk truck, yes. So obviously got the -- I think that the product
road map for Tesla is incredibly exciting and with obviously Model Y coming fairly
soon, about a year or so and then the pickup truck, which we hope to unveil
hopefully this summer. We spent a lot of time on designing the pickup truck. So it's --
I think it's going to be great. And I think it's the coolest car I've seen to be frank. I
think it's -- not everyone may share that opinion. But worst case scenario, we'll build
a normal looking truck. No problem. We know what those look like. So this is
something that'll -- if you're driving it down a road, this will look like it came out of a
sci-ﬁ movie. So it will be really cool, we think. Then the Semi, which we really look
forward to getting into production hopefully towards end of next year.
A lot of this also is dependent on our ability to manufacture a lot of cells and make a
lot of battery packs. So there's not much point in adding product complexity if we
don't have enough batteries. Then there's complexity. But without gain. So we'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11

really the main limiting factor.
Then as we scale battery production to very high levels, we actually have to look
further down the supply chain. And we might get into the mining business, I don't
know, maybe, a little bit at least. So we'll do whatever we have to, to ensure that we
can scale at the fastest rate possible.
So to this point, we are going to have a Battery and Powertrain Investor Day. That's
hopefully this summer, before the end of the year, for sure, because I think this is a
big deal.
I mean I think if I were an outside investor, I would really focus on 2 things: what is
the time line to full self-driving. And what is your plan to scale battery production
and get the cost per kilowatt hour lower? Those are -- it's basically battery cells and
full self-driving. Those are the 2 strategic things that are of most importance.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Haha. Exactly. So these are questions that were asked online and then uploaded.
They're actually really smart questions. Been really impressed with I think it's say.com
or sayanything. And yes. So this is a key question is: Are we going to scale battery
production and match that to vehicle demand?
Do you guys want to say anything about that? Or we don't let the cat out of the bag
too much. But still in the bag.
{BIO 16619298 <GO>}
I mean, I think it's right on. I mean those are exactly the right problems that we need
to solve to scale. And they have been for some time. But it's more obvious now than I
think it ever was that we need a large-scale solution to cell production.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. And you get cost per kilowatt hour lower and intensity higher.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. And we're not sitting -- yes, we're not sitting idly by. We're taking all the moves
required to be masters of our own destiny here technologically and otherwise. And I
think through all the experience we've developed with partners and otherwise, we
have -- we will -- we have solutions in place.

A - Elon R. MuskYes. Good question. What aspects of battery production will integration of Maxwell
have? We think this is really quite strategic. But we'll leave the details of this to kind
of the Battery and Powertrain Investor Day. This is -- there are some very important
technologies there that I think will have a big eﬀect on the cost and scaling of cell
production, both reducing the cost and reducing the capital required to scale cell
production.
Do you want to add to it?
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
No. Right on. Absolutely.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I'm sometimes a little optimistic about time frames. It's time you knew. It's time you
knew. Yes, optimism. Would I be doing this if I wasn't optimistic? Geez.
So the -- we do actually have advanced Summon out in early access right now. And
we're making steady improvements to it. It's close to being amazing. It's not quite
there. But it's close. There's a lot of complexity in parking lots, it turns out. So it
would be very easy if you're like on open ground and you summoned a car and it
just drives to you. That's no problem. But if you've got to navigate through a parking
lot and you're eﬀectively going through a maze with a lot of obstacles and people
moving and cars moving, that's quite tricky. So -- but it's close to being magical. So I
feel good about this, this going to wide release relatively fairly soon. Yes.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
I mean, you want it to be good. I mean that's the simplest answer. It's got to be
awesome.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's got to be awesome and super safe. So it can't be -- we don't want to like run
anyone over or that would be bad. So it's tricky. Like if you make the car really
sensitive, then it just grows paranoid and then it doesn't move. Then you don't want
to make it too aggressive because that's bad, too. So the -- and really the threshold
is, is it more convenient to summon your car or walk to your car. And if it's more
convenient to walk to your car, Summon is not that useful. So it has to move
reasonably fast, certainly faster than you could just walk there.
Then what? Status of Tesla insurance. We're pretty close to being able to release that.
We have a small acquisition that we need to complete and a bit of software to write.
But it won't be long before we release that.
Yes, pickup truck event, sometime -- probably sometime this -- towards the end of
summer would be my guess. Like, we're trying to create something here that is really
new and not just derivative of all the other vehicles on the road, that we're trying to
create something new and it's not just basically a copy of the form factor ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11

Page 16 of 31everything else. But you still want it to be great. It's very hard. It was a very hard
thing. And our goal here is to have something that's more functional than an F-150,
which is a great truck and top-selling car -- a top-selling vehicle in the U.S. The -- but
then also better sports car than a basic 911. So that's a hard one. But like it's
physically possible. So I think we can do it. Yes.
So -- do you think Tesla could rely on SpaceX' Starlink? I think we would have to have
a diﬀerent antenna for Starlink because the Starlink antenna is -- I think it's actually
probably the most advanced phased array antenna in the world, including military.
But it's about the size of a medium pizza. So it would be ﬁne for trucks and RVs and
airplanes and any kind of like a house or a business or something like that. But it
would look a little odd on the roof of a sedan. So I think -- but we could make a
smaller antenna and maybe use it. But I think most likely, we would continue to rely
on the cellular networks. The value of Starlink -- the main value of Starlink is
providing low-latency, high-bandwidth access to sparse and moderately sparse, like,
look, relatively low-density areas. So be like basically rural or semirural areas, places
that don't have connectivity right now. So I think it's like quite a great system. But it's
probably able to serve like 3% to 5% of people in the world. And that's a lot of
people because of all the people in the world. But it's actually not ideal for high-
density cities. It's really to serve the underserved or poorly served, is what Starlink's
about.
We're going to have tiny wipers. I think actually probably just applying some
hydrophobic coatings will most likely solve this problem. So we had this issue with
the front radar where you can accumulate ice and snow on the front and then the
radar can be obscured. But if we apply some -- just a thin hydrophobic coating, sort
of water-repellent coating, then it -- that usually solves the problem. So probably
something like that or words that -- please clean the snow oﬀ the camera.
So we feel good about demand. That's, I think, not a major issue. Proﬁtability is
always challenging if you're a fast growing company. And I think the scale at which
Tesla's growing is like hard to appreciate. But last year, we doubled our ﬂeet. Like --
so we made as many cars last year as we had in our entire history. And this year, it's
going to be pretty similar at least sort of 60% to 80% growth of the total vehicle
ﬂeet, maybe more than that. So it's hard to be proﬁtable with that level of growth.
We can slow down. But then that would not be good for sustainability and the cost
of electric vehicles and solar and storage and all that. So -- but I think we can be cash
ﬂow positive despite having a very high growth rate. So...
Then what about update for like rideshare? I guess like sort of we could kind of
practice a rideshare ﬂeet with people and then that will be good for ﬁguring out
things for the robotaxi ﬂeet in the future. So I mean this might make sense. I mean
we'll probably do something like this, probably makes sense, yes, sort of a
supervised robotaxi.
Then yes, we'd be happy take questions from the audience.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11

A - Elon R. Musk
A - Drew Baglino
A - Elon R. MuskWow. Okay. Yes. So I don't know which side we're starting with. But I don't know, the
right side. Sure.
My name is (Brian Campbell). I have been a shareholder of Tesla for a couple of
years now. I try to buy more shares as often as I can aﬀord to. I really believe in this
company, its products, its mission, its leadership. I want to -- I feel privileged to be
able to cast my lot in with you. And I want to thank you and the whole Tesla team for
all of your hard work and dedication.
My question pertains to Tesla Energy. I have read several analyses concluding that
signiﬁcant hurdles along the path towards sustainable energy is transmission of
electricity over long distances. Since renewable energy production and capacity is
concentrated in certain regions, being able to eﬃciently transmit that electricity to
the -- to other regions seems to be an important part of the equation. I was hoping
that you might share some of your thoughts about this part of the equation and if it
might make sense for Tesla to someday get involved in electricity transmission.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, I think the -- a big part of the value of Solar Roof or retroﬁt solar on the roofs of
your houses and businesses and whatnot is that so you can have localized power
generation. Then if you have a battery storage, that's also very helpful for stabilizing
the grid. So you can sort of overproduce energy during the day and then release it at
night and actually use the Powerwalls and Powerpacks as a massive network for grid
stabilization and for providing energy, essentially ﬂowing it back into the grid. And
that would make a big diﬀerence to reducing the need for long-distance power
lines. I think very few people want more long-distance power lines. They're generally
not great -- don't look great. It's sort of slightly unnerving to drive under them and
that kind of thing. So you want localized power generation. And then you don't need
to build more substations and long-distance power lines. I think that's the answer.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Also, storage is a really great way to improve the utilization of the existing
transmission grid. The transmission grid is kind of like the highway system. It's very
rarely busy. And so what storage can do is make it busy all the time. So you get a lot
more utilization out of the existing infrastructure.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. In fact, like one of the things I think could be pretty interesting is for utilities.
We've done a lot of large-scale utility battery installations, most notably the one in
South Australia, which has signiﬁcantly outperformed their expectations. And we're
going to be doing a number of other projects in Australia and around the world. And
we've done some very big projects in California. So I think energy storage, as Drew is
pointing out, is actually extremely important. And you could actually probably locally
put Powerpacks in the substation. If you don't know what a substation is it's sort of
like where the high power lines come in and then it gets dropped from like, say,
11,000 volts to 400 volts or 500 volts and then gets distributed to a community. So ifFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11

A - Elon R. Muskyou see a bunch of weird looking electrical equipment with a bunch of -- with high
power lines coming into it, that's called a substation. But you could, in that same
footprint, ﬁt a number of Powerpacks. Then to Drew's point, when power usage is
low such as like at night it drops considerably, then you can charge up the
Powerpacks and then discharge them during the day. Then you wouldn't need to
build extra substations and power lines, which are very disruptive to communities.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
That's exactly what the Southern California Edison project was. It was at a substation
doing exactly that. So it's a good existence proof.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}

(Tony Miller), shareholder. China is a place where there's a lot of car action right now.
There's a lot of volume over there, a lot of growth markets. And they have 60% of the
EVs. So I want to ask you about the Giga 3 project and its goal. The building that
you're building is a Fremont-scale operation, maybe a little bit bigger. And last year,
you said it was 500,000 units per year target. That seems a little bit low to me
because...
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Okay. Sure. I think you're probably...
For a company -- for a country like China. And that would give us like 29% if the
other players, providers or product sellers stayed still, which they won't. Also, if we're
at volume going to higher volume, we learn more, get the cost down. That's a good
thing. Also, we connect up with the supply chain, which is very powerful over there,
advanced car electronics, batteries, Panasonic, CATL, Samsung and LG, people like
that. On the demand side, with no import fees, our cars compare very well to all the
other products. And the Chinese like Tesla, style, luxury, quality, range. So -- plus,
they need help getting rid of smog in their cities. So -- and maybe we could even
export from that factory to other Asian factories. So why was the target set at
500,000? Do you think, in China, we are being aggressive enough?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Hold on. Have you seen how fast that China factory has been built?
Yes. Two months or less.

Nothing has ever been built so fast if you (actually really)...
Why not 2?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, okay. So okay. We can't spend money too fast. We'll run out of it. So there's like -
- we're -- yes, we're -- I mean I think like long term, that factory will probably do more
than 500,000. So sort of like an interim goal, maybe it does 1 million or more long
term. But then probably, we should look at maybe having -- like China is pretty big
geographically. And so it may make sense to have factories in other parts of China in
order to reduce logistics costs. The -- like a very big impact on the capital eﬃciency
of any company is the time from when you receive raw materials to building the
product and then getting the product to the end customer. And so if you can
compress that time to where ideally -- in an ideal circumstance, you receive the
payment for the car before you have to pay for all of the ingredients of the car, then
the faster you grow, the more capital you have. So it is very important to localize the
product production and have the supply chain be close by and for everything to
move really fast because then you can actually scale. And the faster you scale, the
more cash you have. Whereas the counterpoint is, if you have to pay for all of the
ingredients long before you get paid for the car, which is currently true for cars that
are outside the U.S. because we have to put them on a boat, go through customs,
then transport them within Europe and China. So our non-U. S. production is
challenging from a cash ﬂow standpoint because you have to pay for everything
long before we get paid for the car. And so a big advantage of the local production
in China and Europe will be solving for that cash ﬂow gap.
(Daniel Andy), I'm in the public real estate investment industry. Given the continued
need for Supercharger expansion, I think there's an opportunity to partner with a
public real estate -- publicly traded real estate company to buy the land Tesla wants
for Superchargers or even to buy land Tesla currently owns for Superchargers,
structure a lease to just initially cover the costs of holding the land. And through my
experience in public real estate, I think there would be huge demand to invest in the
necessary infrastructure for EV charging, which, eﬀectively for Tesla, would ﬁnance
and aggressively speed up Supercharger expansion while preserving Tesla's capital.
Would that be of interest?

rate. Actually, sometimes they pay us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11

I'm not sure if it's a lease or not. But even cell tower REITs, they have leases on the

Okay, I think that's essentially like adding Superchargers to the asset-backed line. It's
a little tricky to -- you have to -- when dealing with ﬁnance companies, they will
generally say what's the resale value of that in a worst-case scenario. Then it's like
sort of tricky to, say where -- who do you sell it to. And that, I think, tends to be their
objection. But generally, I think our capital eﬃciency of Superchargers is quite, quite
good and getting better. So...

holding oﬀ purchasing Tesla cars because of their concern about the future of the
company. So the company has done a fantastic job at solving the big issues that
confronted them in manufacturing and engineering. And my question is, what's the
plan to put more energy behind the marketing communications and take this issue
head on so that the true great American success story gets told.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. It's true, true, what you say. It's very distressing. It makes me sad. But I'm not sure
what -- yes. I don't know what to do about it. We do provide a rebuttal. But that is
then typically varied. That's like 7 paragraphs down and if it's there at all. But some of
these things are just incredibly crazy. It's at least 10x more likely for a gasoline car or
a combustion engine car, it's in the name. I mean, come on, it has highly ﬂammable
ﬂuid that's designed to burn. And there's about 200,000 gasoline car ﬁres per year
in the U.S. alone. And there are -- it's extremely rare for a Tesla car to catch ﬁre. And if
it does, it's just incredibly rare and it's due to some extenuating circumstances. It's
very slow. And it's almost never harmful. I mean would you rather have like a
gasoline-powered cell phone or a battery-powered cell phone? I mean it's like no-

I think that if you put the same kind of energy towards solving this problem that you
put towards solving the battery module production problem, you could do it. You
could change the narrative.

the statistics. So it's really hard to have a serious injury in a Tesla, like it's not -- it's
quite rare. And when you do look at objective numbers like the NHTSA probability of
injury, which is you could get on the Internet, the Teslas have the lowest probability
of injury of any car tested. So like if it was possible to have a 6 star, we would have a
6 star. It's like -- literally it's absurdly safe. And yes, it's -- there's just a lot of forces

Okay. Sounds good. We'll give you the information. And you can sort of spread it
around. I mean the reason our sales are good is really because of you guys. And it's
sort of customer testimonies and referral is the key to our sales. That's why it's good.
So yes.
Elon, my name is (Steve). I've been a shareholder since 2012. And I've owned your
vehicle since 2013. And I've enjoyed both rides.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's a bit of a roller coaster.
That's true. But I actually enjoyed it coming in, in 2012.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Okay. Yes, yes.
Just to that last gentleman's comment, it's obviously on your mind, many people's
minds. So I'm just going to sneak in a little suggestion. You're right. The constructive
response is so. So challenging. And maybe one little opening would be there are
some people such as Michael Bloomberg, who is both obviously a titan in the media
industry and also very, very publicly expresses his care about the environment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11

A - Elon R. MuskPerhaps not a debate but a discussion, a joint discussion to talk about climate
change, public awareness. I think you get the point at where I'm trying to go with
that and have it be something public. There might be other people. I know last year,
Arianna Huﬃngton expressed her concerns for your well-being. I think your well-
being would be best served if people -- I think really the biggest issue with the
media -- and I shouldn't say issue, the biggest challenge is there doesn't seem to be
anybody in the media who's pointing out what other parties in the media are doing.
So eﬀectively, utterly false narratives receive a police escort to the public. Nobody is
speaking up about it. So that's why I suggest people like Bloomberg or Arianna
Huﬃngton.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. That's a good idea. Yes, I mean, weirdly, there have been quite a few negative
articles in Bloomberg.
Yes. There have.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
So -- but perhaps talking to Michael Bloomberg would be helpful. I agree, we need
to take action here. I think we'll deﬁnitely provide people with like clear rebuttals of
the disinformation. That's a good idea because we've done a piecemeal. But there's
not really like a page that just debunks the myths. You kind of have to put it together
from a number of comments that we've made over time. But we could put it all
together on 1 page and sort of debunk the myth, that's going to be pretty good.
Elon, I'm (John) from Irvine and with seeing the Model 3 being so successful and the
Solar facet of your business coming up, I was wondering where you see Tesla is on
their mission to accelerate the (avenues of same old) transport and what hindrances
or facilitators you see in the future in that mission.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well I think we've really helped convince the auto industry to move towards
electriﬁcation. When we ﬁrst started out, we had sort of like the kind of the -- I mean
I've -- to be clear, I've always felt like electric cars and solar were important from
when I was in -- a freshman in college. And I just always thought that it would just
happen because it's just obviously the right thing from a physics standpoint. But this
was not guaranteed. And it's actually -- so I kind of trace Tesla back to 2003 with J.B.
and I having lunch in El Segundo -- it was with Rosen. Harold Rosen?

Harold, yes.

A - Drew Baglino
A - Elon R. MuskYes. That was like a good conversation.
{BIO 16619298 <GO>}
Well I mean I think we've made pretty amazing progress since then. We didn't
exactly envision how this would unfold and exactly being here and standing here, at
least I didn't.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I thought we just for sure would fail like...
{BIO 16619298 <GO>}
But it needed to be done. I mean it was clearly something that was worth doing,
even if the odds of becoming where we are today or even 10% of that or 1% of that
were slim. It was still worth doing. But it's pretty awesome to see EVs driving around
on every road all over the place. It's incredible. But it's still 1%. So we -- while it's
rewarding and it's awesome to see what -- where we've come, there's still a long way
to go. So we can't -- I don't know -- I feel mixed emotions that we shouldn't pat
ourselves on the back too much.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Deﬁnitely not. But back in 2003, 2004, there was -- people thought like electric cars
were the stupidest thing ever and deﬁnitely not going to work and would be bad in
every way. And we're like a milk ﬂoat or something or like a golf cart and like they
would not look good or go far or go fast or it was just like they would just be bad in
every way. And they kind of were. That's like they generally were.
So the number of times -- sort of talk about the media situation today, which is very
negative. But it's pretty much always been negative actually. This is unchanged from
2003. And I mean way back -- you can go way back, like 15 years. And this is like, oh,
Tesla is the dumbest thing ever, it's never going to succeed. Then it's like, well, I do
think there's a good chance we won't succeed but just worth trying. And now there's
-- I think almost every car company has announced electric cars. And some have
announced that all of their cars will go electric sometime in the next decade. This is a
good thing.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And on the energy side, to complete the picture, I guess I will just brieﬂy say, 100%
renewable grids were in a similar situation, I would say, in 2003. And now both Tesla
and a number of other partners in this eﬀort are succeeding in taking entire islands,
parts of nations 100% renewable. And that shows the growth on that other key
aspect of the mission. And yes, that's been personally very rewarding and then for
J.B. as well because, in 2003, he was the TA of a class I was in, talking all about this.

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantYes. It goes back a while. Yes. So exactly. So solar and battery storage, yes, that was
also like laughed at pretty much, still kind of is. But it's -- obviously, the key to a
sustainable future is I think primarily solar, obviously with wind and geothermal but
things that are sustainable long term. Then you have to have battery storage
because generally sustainable energy like the sun, it doesn't shine 24 hours a day. So
you have to have batteries. So -- but like the 3 elements of sustainable energy future,
electric cars, solar and battery storage. And so we're trying to advance that as quickly
as possible. Then I think when we show that it can be done, then other companies try
to do it as well. And that's great.
Everyone, my name is (Jessica Heiss). Right now, I work in media relations. So I'd love
to help change the negative narrative. First, Elon, I just wanted to congratulate you
on the Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication. My question for you is,
as a horse owner, I'm wondering what the towing capacity for the truck.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. I didn't mean to insult horses earlier by the way.
No. That's ﬁne.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Horses are cool. It will -- it's designed to meet or exceed an F-150. So if an F-150 can
tow it, then the Tesla pickup truck should be able to do it.
So Elon, we're at about 90 minutes. Do you want to take one more question from
each side?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, yes, a few more questions. That's ﬁne.
Elon, my name is (Caleb Elston). I recently got my Model 3. And I'm happy it has
hardware 3 in it. So I watched the Investor Day for autonomy. And you talked a lot
about the FSD chip, the neural network. But you didn't talk much about the gap
between navigate on autopilot today to the end of 2019. I was wondering if you
could geek out a little bit on where we're going to go from now till December,
January, February, feature wise. Is that already running in your cars like the demo?
Are we going to cherry pick it? Or what gives you the conﬁdence that feature
complete, not hands-oﬀ. But feature complete is possible? And what -- can you
excite us a little bit about what that's going to be like?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I mean I -- when I drive like the latest development version of the software, it can
take me from my house to the oﬃce. But not with -- but there are interventions at
times. So it doesn't perfectly deal with every intersection or every turn. And I think it's
possible to -- like, well, you can obviously just like game the system and just make it
perfect for a particular route. But then that's just going to work on that route. Then if
that route changes or there's construction, then it won't work. So it's very hard to
come up with a general solution. So when one reads about these other self-driving
car companies, the issue is that they have very speciﬁc solutions. But they're brittle.
They rely on very high-resolution maps, a lot of LIDARs, a high precision -- like really
expensive GPS and inertial measurement and -- but it's -- but even then, it's just not a
general solution. And if they go oﬀ the route that they're used to, they don't work. So
we -- when we release something, we're releasing it to 500,000 cars and all over the
world. And so it has to be a general solution. So then we -- our progress may appear
slower than it actually is relative to others that are developing self-driving
technology. But in fact, I think it is quite a lot more advanced because any element
that we release is a general solution.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
There's also like a plateau that you will reach taking the alternative approach that just
having experienced what the team, a lot of the work ahead of the Investor Day, like
the trajectory is crazy, especially with the advanced compute capability that we have.
So that's my personal comment on it, I guess.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. We learn a lot of -- in terms of like what should we retrain the neural net to do.
Then once we discover, okay, we need to train it to -- we need a net that's going to
like really eﬀectively recognize curves for example. And previously, we trained the
net on free space. So it's like -- free space is just anything you can drive on that's not
going to destroy the car. But this is not comfortable if you're just driving on like dirt
or the car just drives over the grass. Like technically yes. But it's going to be
disturbing. So we -- like road edge and curb are 2 training nets that we are
developing right now to say this is independent of drivable free space. So you want
to know what drivable free space is for an emergency. So if you need to go on the
shoulder of the road to avoid something, then okay, drive. Free space is important.
But then you also need to know where does true road space end because it's
undesirable to go past true road space. Then for -- especially for parking lots and
tight corners, just recognizing curves. These like little details. they make -- they're
very important.
Yes. So I mean I have most of this working in like the development version that's on
my car. I have actually 2 dev branches, 1 for enhanced Summon and 1 for full self-
driving in 2 diﬀerent cars. But it would not be good to release that to the general
public, I think, not yet. All right.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11

India.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Thank you. Are you from -- let me guess.
You guys have a great team and you guys are the problem solvers. Thanks for
persevering all the way through to the ﬁnancial, intellectual business problems. And
Elon, you're such a visionary and a leader. Thank you. So much. It puts a smile on my
face when I hear Gwynne Shotwell point out to Mars is it's the ﬁxer-upper of a planet.
You instill those values into your employees and every fan boy out there. Thank you.
So much for all that.
I'd like to ask a question. Why do you ask this team, which has put a Roadster up in
freaking space, right? So actually I'm out of questions on that part. So then I thought
to myself, any questions, no. And I've always felt bad for Nikola Tesla who has been a
great inventor of our time. And for a genius that he has been, he was always
constrained by funds to run his experiments. And as a result, world lost so much
more. Did history repeat itself? I don't know. Maybe. But it's up to us not to repeat
the same mistakes and fund this Tesla this time to make impossible a reality. As Uncle
Ben rightly said, "With great power comes great responsibility." People and
organizations with excellent balance sheets, you have the power to invest and make
a diﬀerence; and hence, you have the responsibility to do so. It's time big companies
unite when it comes to welfare of the planet and sustainability of the generations to
come. And speaking of great companies, who knows better than Berkshire Hathaway
of picking a great company? As the market paradigm has now shifted from buying
proﬁtable companies to buying companies who are innovating and changing the
world for the better, I request Berkshire management to consider investing in Tesla
for the long term. Why? Because you want insurance? They have it. You want
automobiles? They have it. Electriﬁcation? They have it. Utility? They have it.
(Robotaxis), whatever you want, they have it. So -- and because there has never been
a better opportunity for the world and there has never been a better buy price for
Tesla in 2019 than right now.
Lastly, congratulations to all the Tesla shareholders in advance who sooner or later
are going to be part owners of this trillion -- multitrillion-dollar behemoth. And to
Elon and team, thank you so very much from all of us and the future generations who
will want to thank you and your team for all the great work you did, you do and you
will do. Cheers.

I thought that question might be asked. So we -- I hope soon. There's -- the
regulatory or like the rules for importing to India are kind of complicated. Or -- yes,
we deﬁnitely want to come to India. So -- but there are like complicated rules around
like the tariﬀs for importing and then what you're allowed to do as for sales and
service. And we're currently able to sell as many cars as we can make. So the --
adding additional complexity is not required right now. But I think we really want to
come to India as soon as we can. So I think I would be really surprised if we're not
there by next year. I think that's -- at least next year I think, yes. Right. Right.

Treatment of Animals.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Okay. The steering wheel.
{BIO 20184332 <GO>}
Yes. The steering wheel. You got it. So during last year's annual shareholder meeting,
you assured us that Model Y "would not have any leather in it, including in the
steering wheel if it does have a steering wheel." We have tried conﬁrming this
privately. But have been met with silence. And the website does not specify. It's also
our understanding that all current Tesla models come standard with a leather
steering wheel and need to be special ordered to be vegan.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
That's true. Currently.
{BIO 20184332 <GO>}
As you know, the United Nations reports that animal agriculture, which includes the
leather industry, is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than all of the
world's transportation combined. The Higg Index has found that in terms of water
scarcity, climate change...
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Okay. I got it. I totally agree the -- I actually asked this question of a team earlier
this week. And I believe we're close to having a nonheated steering wheel that's not
leather. There are some challenges when we heat the nonleather material and also
how well it wears over time. So steering wheel, that's like actually, it really needs to
be very hardy because there's a lot of -- like we have a lot of basically oil and sweat
and stuﬀ on our hands. It gets kind of nasty if you don't have like the right surface
treatments on the material. So it's an easier proposition to solve it for seats than it is
for the steering wheel. So there's actually a remarkable amount of eﬀort to solve the
steering wheel. But it is a thing that we are -- we're working on and hope to release
soon.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11

sure the Model Y and the Model 3 soon. And you can also special order for the S and
X.
Yes, like third row.
I'm (Dan Howe). I just have a quick question and that is you've expressed your
frustration. I think we're all frustrated with the media narrative around Tesla. And
you've expressed your frustration in refuting some of the false information out there.
There's another alternative to that, which is to proactively advertise. And my question
to you is are there any thoughts to revisiting the advertising decision.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. Well as I was saying, currently, we are selling more cars than we can make. So it
is not -- spending money on advertising would make things worse ﬁnancially. And
I'm sure it will probably increase demand. But we're selling more cars than we can
make. So that's not a thing that's necessary right now. And we're trying to make as
many cars as possible. So yes, I think like advertising -- like generally I have not -- I've
had an aversion to advertising because there's like -- it's just too much trickery in
advertising. There's this like -- there's a lot of false association, whereas they'll have a
bad product and then put it in a nice environment with good-looking people and
then like trick you into buying it. It's like common and then some of the advertising
can be quite strident. So it just tends to be sort of bad. So I don't like advertising for
that reason. But we could have advertising in terms of information, to refute some of
these issues. It's tricky though because if you have an ad that says, "Look, our cars
don't catch on ﬁre. This is BS." Then people might think, "Are your cars actually
catching on ﬁre? Like what's going on?" There's so much trickery in advertising. Like
maybe the opposite thing is happening. I wouldn't say that we're against advertising
forever. But it hasn't been necessary, thus far. And yes. So yes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11

{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, last question.
Everyone, I'm (Lux Filaday). I have a really exciting question. Will Tesla make aquatic
cars? And if so, when?

Aquatic car as in a boat or submarine car.

Oh, aquatic. Oh, I see. Okay. Do you mean a car that can go in the water basically?
On or under or both, the water.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's funny you should mention that. We do actually have a design for a submarine car
like the one from The Spy Who Loved Me, the -- sort of the Lotus that turns into a
sub. And actually -- I thought that was like the coolest thing I'd seen in a movie. So I
actually -- I have that, the one from the movie. Now that one cannot actually
transform because it has like ﬁns where the wheels are. That's obviously not going to
work. But if you make it a bit bigger, then you can actually have a submarine car. It's
like technically possible. I think the market for this will be small, small but
enthusiastic. So -- but we actually do have a design for a submarine car. Like that
would be -- it'd be diﬃcult. It would not be -- be a bit of a distraction I think. So -- but
maybe we'll make one as a show car at some point. That would be really fun.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-11
