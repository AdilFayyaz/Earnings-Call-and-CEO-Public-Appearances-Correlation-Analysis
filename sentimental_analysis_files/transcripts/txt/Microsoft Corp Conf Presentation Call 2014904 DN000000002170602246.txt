So I'm Walter Pritchard again, the software analyst here at Citi, and super-excited to
have Scott Guthrie from Microsoft. I was telling him I saw him there and he wasn't
wearing his red shirt, which I think Scott -- I don't know, you've been at Microsoft for
longer than I've been alive probably and you've worn a red shirt I presume every day
because every time I see him in public he's got the red shirt on.
But Scott used to be the front man for -- at least when I got to know him, he was the
front man for the company around developers and developers have been a big part
of how Microsoft has gotten to where it is today in terms of the loyalty of millions of
.NET and other developers.
So Scott, to kind of roll, I think with Satya Nadella moving into the CEO role, to sort
of ﬁll in behind Satya and run the enterprise and cloud business. So a big part of the
revenue at Microsoft, all the server products as well as Azure. So Scott's going to
spend about 10 minutes giving us some background on the business and where he
is focused, and then we'll jump back in to do some Q&A as we've done in the other
sessions.
{BIO 15931914 <GO>}
Great. Thanks a bunch. Well, good afternoon and thank you for joining us today and
we were looking forward to having an opportunity to spend some time with you. As
was mentioned, my name is Scott Guthrie and I run the Cloud and Enterprise Group
here at Microsoft.
At Microsoft, one of the things that Satya has talked quite a bit about the last six
months is the fact that we now live in a mobile-ﬁrst, cloud-ﬁrst world. And across
Microsoft, we're working hard to deliver a set of solutions that really enable
customers to fully take advantage of this new world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 2 of 15And within the Cloud and Enterprise Group, we deliver a number of our core
enterprise and server products that enable this world, speciﬁcally Windows Server,
System Center, Active Directory, our SQL business and all of our Associated Data
Products, Visual Studio and all of our developer products and then also Microsoft
Azure in our commercial cloud computing platform.
And we've been hard kind of charging on this cloud ﬁrst world really for the last two
years within the Cloud and Enterprise Group and we're seeing some really nice
momentum in the adoption of it. In the last 12 months, we've gained more than ﬁve
points of market share versus VMware in our on-premises private cloud business and
really seeing a nice run rate there. On the public cloud base, we have now more than
57% of the Fortune 500 running solutions deployed on top of Microsoft Azure.
We now just passed the 1 million SQL database deployed in Azure and we're seeing
that growth steadily at 10% month-over-month. We have more than 30 trillion objects
toward now in our Azure Storage system. We have more than 300 million users
inside our Azure Active Directory and we're processing more than 13 billion
authentications per week. And we've got more than 1.6 million developers registered
with our new Visual Studio Online service, which provides a set of SaaS services for
developers in the cloud. That's a service we just launched this past November.
And all of the adoption has been driving some really nice revenue numbers as well.
And you can see Cloud and Enterprise FY14 revenue growth was 13% year-over-year.
We're particularly pleased with the diversity of the growth. In FY14 we had ﬁve
separate businesses within Cloud and Enterprise that were each over $1 billion of
revenue. Our SQL business in particular has been on ﬁre the last couple of years. We
just passed the $6 billion a year mark with it and last year grew it at 19% year-over-
year.
Even looking at some of our more mature server products in the on-premise space,
like Windows Server and Systems Center, we're seeing some really nice mix shift up
from our standard to our premium editions of our products and we're able to grow
the premium revenue in that space by more than 40% year-over-year.
And with our commercial cloud, we announced as part of our fourth quarter
earnings that we now passed the $4.4 billion a year annualized run rate for
commercial cloud, which is basically Oﬃce 365 and Azure. And Azure itself is
growing at more than 150% year-over-year. So overall good market [ph] momentum.
In terms of one of the questions that people often ask me at events like this is, well,
how do you diﬀerentiate your cloud oﬀering versus the others in the market. And
one of the things I often talked about with customers is these three like circles of
capabilities that we think the combination makes us unique. And really basically they
are hyper-scale, enterprise grades and hybrid and the Microsoft Cloud is the only
cloud that have all three, and combined, we think it really provides a truly unique
cloud oﬀering that enables diﬀerentiated solutions for our customers. What I want to
do is to spend the rest of the time drilling into each of these and kind of giving aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 15sense of ﬂavor in terms of what each one is and why the combination of them is
really unique in the enterprise space.
One of the elements of having a hyper-scale cloud is having a cloud that really truly
provides global reach. And we've been hard at work on the Azure side, over the last
12 months in particular, building out our Azure footprint to run all over the world. As
of today, we now have more than 17 regions around the world where customers can
go ahead and deploy their code and this kind of global footprint enables customers
to deploy their solutions closer to their own customers as well as employees than
ever before.
To put this in perspective, this is actually more than two times the number of regions
that AWS has opened around the world today and it's more than ﬁve times the
number of regions that the Google Cloud has. And so it kind of is a fairly unique
scale and opportunity.
What makes each of these regions truly impressive though is the size of them. And
it's really kind of diﬀerentiate, I'd call, a hyper-scale cloud provider from sort of a
more traditional hosting or co-lo environment. Each of the regions basically consists
the data centers where each data center is approximately the size of one football
ﬁeld in length. And what's impressive is the fact that each region (inaudible) you can
park up to two planes inside them, it's a feature we don't use much, but gives you
kind of a sense of just the size of each of these buildings.
What makes them unique though is the fact that each region is not one data center,
but up to 16, which really is a huge amount of capacity, enough to run about
600,000 servers in that each region in one of those regions. Remember we have 17
of these open up now around the world.
And this kind of hyper-scale footprint really enables immense scale economics, the
point where we can basically continually cut our prices for customers and we can
basically run an operation that is cheaper than pretty much everyone else on the
planet. It also gives our customers the ability to instantly scale up and down capacity
pretty much anywhere around the world with full conﬁdence.
So we ultimately think there is going to be basically three hyper-scale providers in
the world, us, Amazon and Google. We then basically diﬀerentiate with these other
two circles of capabilities, which is enterprise grades, and providing a truly
diﬀerentiated enterprise oﬀering in terms of service levels as well as the ability to do
hybrid and take advantage of hybrid computing.
We're the only hyper-scale provider out there that actually has software that runs
both in the cloud as well as in on-premise customer environments as well as other
service provider environments. And this kind of enables customers to basically
maximize their existing investments and easily bridge to the cloud and kind of
enable truly unique solutions.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 15And we kind now provide a pretty wide range of solutions out there whether ranging
from backup to DR to database replication to identity management in the cloud, and
you're going to see us build out these kind of capabilities more and more over time.
And we think having the fact that we have that large on-premise footprint provides
us a very natural attach to the cloud, and again, enables us to take those scale
economics and drive the costs down cheaper than anyone else can in the market.
So hyper-scale, enterprise grade, hybrid, Azure is the only cloud and Microsoft is the
only vendor out there that delivers on all three, and combined, we really think they
provide a truly unique oﬀering that enables us to provide services to enterprises and
to businesses that really no one else can in the market and allows us to compete
hard.
This -- one of the things we focus on within C&E is notion we call kind of pillars or
solutions that we focus on. And I'll kind of walk through a little bit of some of the
trends from data center pillar capabilities that we provide in terms of core
infrastructure. This slide also talks about some of the other end-to-end scenarios that
we're focusing on, the combination of which we think provides kind of a really
compelling oﬀering to enterprises where they can actually leverage our solutions,
even. If they don't use us as an infrastructure cloud, these other categories allow us
to provide really good value to them as well.
And to give you kind of a sense of this, I'm just going to quickly walk through two
other ones, which is the enterprise mobility and then the unlock insight from any
data. On the enterprise mobility front, one of the things we're looking to enable is
employees to basically use the devices they love while keeping their companies
secure. And we launched in May a new suite we call the Enterprise Mobility Suite,
which basically combines a number of diﬀerent capabilities into kind of one nice
bundle for customers that enables them to basically enable their employees to be
productive on any device they want to use and to connect any SaaS-based solution
they want to use as well.
As part of this, we include our Intune oﬀering, which provides mobile device
management. This works including with iOS as well as Android-based devices and
provides IT a way to basically enforce policies on top of all their employees in a fairly
non-intrusive way and take advantage of the bring-your-own-device trend that we're
seeing in the enterprise.
We also then add in identity integration as part of the suite which is more about core
diﬀerentiators. This enables more than single sign-on against more than 2,000
diﬀerent SaaS applications out there, including ones not running inside our cloud
environment. And as part of this suite, we actually provide what's called SaaS
Discovery Capabilities so that an enterprise, IT or CIO, could actually look at their
network logs and actually determine not just which of the SaaS apps that they've
approved that their enterprise is using, but which are the hundreds of other SaaS
apps that their employees are taking advantage of, but IT doesn't know about.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 15And once they discover them, you can basically go into Azure and very quickly wire
up and adapt it, which allows you to enforce single sign-on with your corporate
company credentials against that solution. This is basically two steps and you can
enable it for Salesforce.com, we support Workday, Concur, Google Apps, just for
kicks, we even let you manage AWS this way and it provides a really nice solution
that allows enterprises to keep their identity secure.
You might have heard in the news, a little bit of hacking going on with some
celebrities earlier this week. One of the things that's built into this solution that is
kind of compelling to you is built-in machine learning so that as employees are
logging in, if we detect suspicious behavior like loss of password, reset attempts or
loss of incorrect passwords or someone that's supposed to be in New York logging
in from Romania, we basically -- it will automatically ﬁle an alert to that security
oﬃcers and we can automatically enforce two factor authentication on top of that
device. So the next time they log in, they actually have to also answer say an SMS
challenge in addition to knowing the password.
The combination kind of again provides a much more secure solution. We're also as
part of this enabling remote desktop support running in the cloud. This basically
allows organizations to run any Windows Client application they want in our cloud
and expose it to all diﬀerent types of devices. So we have an iOS, Android as well as
Windows Client. And so user to basically click and sign in using that same security
mechanism and immediately be productive on any existing Windows application
regardless of what device they're using, all running safely in our cloud, optionally
bridged in a hybrid way through an on-premises environment.
This basically is kind of a huge opportunity for us in FY15. Again, it was on the price
list literally only for a few weeks in FY14 and we've seen really, really strong demand
for it.
What's nice about it is it's not only kind of a solution that we think is really tailored for
this mobile-ﬁrst, cloud-ﬁrst world, but it's also one that allows that we're uniquely
positioned from a sales motion perspective and that it clearly attaches to a lot of our
other existing motions out there and you're going to see us very aggressively go
after this solution for every Oﬃce 365 customer that (inaudible) and every time a
customer renews one of the Client Access licenses with us, which they do every two
to three years. This is kind of an obvious attach that we're going to be able to do as
part of that motion. And what's great, again, it works regardless of what infrastructure
cloud you are using and it's kind of an easy attach to any SaaS-based solution they
are doing as well.
The last thing I will just walk through really quickly is our unlock insight on any data
pillar. Core part of our value proposition here is to really deliver a set of data
solutions that enable customers to get more insight as well as to run their businesses
better. I mentioned earlier, our SQL business is now at $6 billion a year run rate,
growing at 19%.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 15Q - Walter PritchardIn addition to kind of our core SQL work, we also have a whole bunch of additional
data services that we're now providing, and increasingly going forward, you'll see us
move up into the data analytics space, which is a category we don't really compete
in today and which we think is right for disruption and a really nice adjacent business
for us to add into.
You'll also see us continue to add on additional SaaS capabilities to our data space,
one of which here I'll do a quick demo of is Power BI. This basically is a SaaS-based
solution that enables organizations to create operational dashboards for their
enterprises. What's nice is it seamlessly integrates with any on-premise data both
with our SQL business, but also with other people's data on-prem, so including
Oracle, IBM, SAP et cetera, but it also is designed to kind of embrace this mobile-
ﬁrst, cloud-ﬁrst world with SaaS, so you can also pull data from any SaaS provider as
well. And so for example, we have sales force integrations we'll demo here in just a
second, and in fact we'll just roll the video, we can kind of see a quick view of this in
action.
(Video Playing)
That's just one sort of simple example in terms of the data product that we're
coming out to market with later on this year, that we think, again, is a nice adjacent
business to kind of our core business that we provide today. That again is an
example where we can actually leverage and take advantage of it both in our on-
prem world and the cloud world both with Azure as well as any other SaaS-based or
other infrastructure cloud provider out there.
So in terms of providing kind of a quick overview that's a little bit of our business,
these are some of the other solutions. I am not going to go into detail in any of the
other ones, but we think combined, they really provide a set of oﬀerings where
regardless of where the customer is looking to transform their data centers, store
and analyze data, manage their mobile workforce, create an Internet of Things or
enable next generation of applications, we have a great solution for you. They
compose incredibly well and we think they go after the enterprise markets where
there is an awful lot of money we've made and a very healthy business for us to drive
for the long-term.
So with that, I'm going to open it up to questions.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
(Technical Diﬃculty) Can you give us some sense as to what they are using it for?
You've outlined a number of business cases. Typically people get going though with
pretty simple things. Can you just talk to us about what the demographics are of that

Q - Walter Pritchard

It's interesting. I mean, so I think a lot of people, when they think of cloud, think of it
in terms of from an existing IT perspective of, hey, I don't want your service on-prem.
I can move into the cloud. And I think there is certainly an element of that that
organizations are looking for as a way to kind of reduce infrastructure costs and
things like that.
I would say the majority of use cases that we're seeing right now in the cloud though
are much more additive to what a traditional IT department would do. In particular, I
would say customer-facing solutions are the things that seem to be migrating to the
cloud the fastest. And if you look at a lot of our customers today, it's often their
departments or the businesses within them often outside of IT that are actually
making the shift to the cloud fastest.
So an example for one of us would be Tesco in the UK is the largest retailer. And they
have a division called Blinkbox, which is kind of the Netﬂix of the UK in that they
provide a premium media streaming service. And that was the ﬁrst department at
Tesco that actually aggressively embraced Azure and basically reinvented all of their
streaming and their infrastructure to the cloud base. And seeing that success, then
you're starting to see other departments within Tesco also kind of make that shift and
including kind of more traditional IT.
And so right now, I would say, a few people had asked me earlier today, is the cloud
cannibalizing your on-prem business or is it replacing it. And right now, I would say
it's very much additive, and I think that the big opportunity with the cloud is the fact
that there is a whole bunch more scenarios that people either don't do today
because it's too costly, or for us, selﬁshly, are doing it with other vendors where the
cloud allows us to kind of basically enter those markets in new ways because they
end up being much more automation as opposed to service level. Take data
analytics as an example. I think there is huge opportunity with machine learning that
kind of democratized predictive analytics, which is a very nice proﬁtable business for
several people. And we hope it can be a proﬁtable business for us. And this is a real
good example of that transition gives us an opportunity to have conversations that
we just aren't in today.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Do you expect that over time over the next two to three years that this continues to
be an additive business? Or do you think you will see migrations as part of the
business, say, in that timeframe?
{BIO 15931914 <GO>}
I think for us, certainly in the near term, I think it's going to continue to be an additive
business. And one of the things that we focused on from a business strategy
perspective is also, how do we kind of design our business model so that it ends up
hopefully being additive from a long-term perspective. So for example, today we
make money oﬀ of the Windows Server license.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03

Q - Walter Pritchard{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 15931914 <GO>}
That's a fairly small percentage of the overall IT spend of Windows Server. And in the
Azure world or even in the AWS world, we still will make money from that Windows
Server license, but if they want in our world or our cloud, we have that opportunity to
certainly make money in the storage layer, in the networking layer, in the compute
layer, and in all the additive management services to go around that frankly we don't
monetize today. And so I hope even in that type of world, we do see a server shift
from on-prem to cloud that there is an opportunity for us to be additive in the net
set. [ph]
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
And how do you think about, I guess, maybe some of this gets to how your business
-- how you are running it from an economics perspective, but do you expect -- what
impact do you expect on revenue and proﬁts as we look at the C&E business over
the next, say, two, three years as you undergo this transition? Is it a -- we've seen
some companies as they move to a cloud type business model, there is a headwind
as maybe you absorb business that was sold upfront on an ongoing basis, other
businesses we haven't seen as much of a headwind. What should we expect there in
terms of revenue and proﬁt?
{BIO 15931914 <GO>}
Well, I think in terms of -- I kind of talked a little bit about some of the ﬁnances in the
beginning. In terms -- right now we are kind of in a unique position where we have a
whole bunch of diﬀerent businesses that are really on ﬁre in a good way. And so
each business is in a slightly diﬀerent space in terms of as you think about transition
to the cloud. But I would say for a lot of these scenarios that even the ones I walked
through, take Power BI, the Enterprise Mobility suite, those are net additives to our
existing client access license business as well as to our existing SQL business.
And so that's the case where the migration to the cloud, those types of cloud
services, don't replace any existing revenue and there is a less of a shift from license
to annuity than you might expect. A lot of our business inside C&E today, just from
an infrastructure perspective, beyond those additive scenarios, is also annuity-based.
And so a large part -- majority of our revenue is based on enterprise agreements,
which are kind of three-year, two, three-year renewals. And so that also kind of
changes the dynamic a little bit from other business -- other competitors that are
probably more transactional-based, gives us a little bit more of a smoother on ramp
[ph] as well I think.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Okay. Got it. And then another sort of economic question here on, Amazon and
Google have been pretty ruthless. Amazon before and now Google has kind of
entered the fray in terms of leaning down price and pushing pricing down. You'veFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 15A - Scott Guthrie
Q - Walter Pritchardlargely matched or roughly matched the price decreases that they pushed through.
Do we get to a point here where it starts to become an impactor on proﬁtability in
terms of from your business? Amazon has proﬁts as a company, give or take. Is that a
concern and how do you manage that concern in terms of the relentless push on
price?
{BIO 15931914 <GO>}
Well, I think in terms of -- I think the way we thought about our business, couple fold.
One is, if you want to go after enterprises and provide kind of a total package
solution for an enterprise, you need to be in the infrastructure business and be able
to oﬀer those types of services and those prices will not always, but I think in many
cases will be commodity-driven. That doesn't mean they are not sophisticated or
important, but the price will be set by the market. And we've made a decision with
Azure, which is -- we will match commodity prices with Amazon. And so if they cut
price, usually within 48 hours we cut it.
And that's basically I think combined together. We need to kind of to cut price and
we need to match. It has, I think, accelerated our overall adoption in a pretty nice
way and it's gotten us to a position where, for some things like storage in particular,
we are probably under the price of what anyone else in the market can oﬀer, this is
three of us, which has kind of put us in a nice structural position. And yet, we have
the cost economics that we can actually continue to do that and still have a long-
term proﬁtable business.
From a portfolio perspective, I think having those types of infrastructure is going to
be key. The thing we want to balance it out with though is also higher value services,
take analytics, take device management and the Enterprise Mobility suite, take
machine learning, take data-as-a-service and those will be kind of much higher
margins oﬀerings, and being able to have kind of an overall package of all of them, I
think ends up being unique.
I would say, also versus Amazon and Google, just on the infrastructure side, we're
also in a slightly unique position in that we don't just monetize while compute and
storage. We also monetize the license software running in that VM. And so whenever
an Amazon sells a Windows VM, we make a decent amount of money from it. And
likewise on Azure, when you sell a VM running Windows, we make also decent
amount of money on it. So as you think about what is our gross margin for core
compute, it's not as bad as you might think because we actually make a fairly decent
chunk oﬀ of the software running inside that VM as well. And so that changes the
overall dynamics probably of our margin business in a way that's probably diﬀerent
than taking the other competitors out there.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Okay, got it. I was actually going to kind of go there next and talk a bit about
platform versus infrastructure. So my sense is the disclosure around your business
has become very transparent in the last year or so, so we really get a sense of what's
going on.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 15A - Scott Guthrie
Q - Walter Pritchard
A - Scott Guthrie
Q - Walter Pritchard
A - Scott GuthrieI think before it was a little bit more diﬃcult to tell, but it appears as though the
Azure business really took oﬀ when you added the infrastructure option and sort of
came into that mainstream market. And you highlighted there that when you attach
your IP in, your intellectual property with Windows or sort of people are building
through APIs, it's a unique oﬀer and you can charge more versus the commodity
product. Can you talk about sort of adoption at this point of the platform level
services, things that ultimately will have that higher margin and where we are today
and how we should think about that in the future versus the commodity piece?
{BIO 15931914 <GO>}
Yeah, I think deﬁnitely on the infrastructure side, I mean, a lot of -- our Azure business
made a pretty substantial change from an interim perspective about two years ago
really when we ﬁrst previewed our infrastructure as a service capabilities and then
later GA'ed it. And in fact, our infrastructure-as-a-service is only GA'ed a year ago,
April. So it's actually less than 18 months since this has been with an SLA. And we've
seen a huge growth from that.
And you know, the analogy I often use with people is, if you're going shopping or
like a shopping mall or you're going into a store, there is the premium services that
people end up thinking about the store for and want to get when they are
purchasing, but then there is also -- they're going to buy stuﬀ [ph], or they are going
to buy something that's much more (inaudible) and that often motivates the trip to
the mall to begin with. And so we had a gap with Azure in our cloud strategy where
we had the premium stuﬀ, but we didn't have the infrastructure capabilities and now
once we close that gap, certainly we are a much more complete oﬀering.
From a sales motion perspective as well, the way that increasingly we sell Azure to
enterprises is through what's called an enterprise agreement and that basically is
someone will buy, say, $1 million of Azure capacity or usage, they can spend it on
infrastructure as well as the premium services and we often see kind of a motion of,
I'll call it land and expand where people will start with infrastructure for desktops and
then they'll very quickly expand out to the premium services. And so I think that's a
key part of our kind of overall motion there.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
So another thing I've been -- we've been watching is you have introduced --
{BIO 15931914 <GO>}
So the last question you asked about what percentage of our coverage --
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Yeah, right. Exactly.
{BIO 15931914 <GO>}
I think what we disclosed in our Q4 numbers were more than half of our Azure
customers are now also using the premium services and that that rate is actuallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03

Page 11 of 15Q - Walter Pritchard

Q - Walter Pritchardincreasing. So that kind of land and expand motion I mentioned is deﬁnitely one that
we're seeing from a usage perspective as well as from a revenue perspective.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Okay. And then the other thing we've noticed is you have been very sort of forward-
thinking in terms of supporting natively non-Microsoft products on top of Azure. I
mean, you had the announcement with Oracle, you're supporting new SQL
databases, you have your own, I think, new SQL database, some sort of release the
technology to the market. And I just use that as an example of seeing some change
in thinking at Microsoft over the last, say, three or four years. How do you ultimately
think about monetizing that type of an oﬀering where it is -- it's a premium service,
but it's not your IP and it might be something that either others get paid on like
Oracle or is an open source, no IP built, sort of technology running on top of Azure?
{BIO 15931914 <GO>}
Yeah, there is an analogy I use within the teams, which is keep your old friends and
make new friends. And I think in the past we've been very focused on keeping our
friends, but not necessarily making new friends and especially in the enterprise
space, every enterprise has a combination of lots of diﬀerent technologies, whether
it's deliberate, whether it's through acquisitions, but they all have Oracle, they all
have SQL, they all have IBM in some shape or form, and whoever, we say our stuﬀ
only works with the Microsoft stuﬀ or kind of closing ourselves out to a bunch of
opportunity. And frankly it's harder to be the trusted vendor if it only works with your
stuﬀ.
And I think that's the shift that we've made the last couple of years and I think that
helped drive that in particular and that's made a big diﬀerence to the market. So as
an example, there are people in the room that might not know we did a partnership
last year with Oracle. And in fact, we're the only cloud vendor other than Oracle that
is certiﬁed for an Oracle Enterprise support. So we call up Oracle for an enterprise
support on someone else's cloud, or say, sorry, we don't support it, but they will on
their could and they'll support it with our cloud, which is a fairly substantial change in
the type of relationship we've had in the past with Oracle.
We've done similar relationships with SAP. We recently announced a partnership
with Salesforce. So things like the Analytics suite that I showed or the Power BI where
you can integrate the Salesforce data. There is an example where, I am sure
Salesforce over time will add more built-in analytics themselves, but by oﬀering the
ability, where we can integrate with theirs as well as thousands of other SaaS vendors
out there, we're able to have kind of a unique play there that I think ends up
appealing to our customer base and gets us into much more conversations where
we can ultimately win.

Got it. And then on part of the success story that's in Microsoft for a few decades
here has been the ISVs, the software vendors, developers inside companies and then
developers inside software companies and then long history of desktop vendors,
software vendors and then server-based software vendors who've built their softwareFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03

Q - Walter Pritchard
A - Scott Guthrieon top of Windows Server, where are we there with Azure? I know not necessarily the
enterprise companies, but a lot of consumer companies, are building on top of EWS
as sort of their stack. The ISV territory has sort of been yours historically. Where are
we with ISV traction on Azure?
{BIO 15931914 <GO>}
Yeah, certainly, I would say as we think about the move to the cloud, I think one of
the things that is important to kind of keep an eye on is both there has been people
that will move to the cloud for infrastructure and for applications and there is
obviously people that move to the cloud and adopt stack, so custom infrastructure
with custom apps and then also SaaS. And winning the hearts and minds of SaaS
vendors is going to play a important part of that. And so that's been one of our core
pushes with Azure from the beginning really, has been on the ISV and almost half of
our Azure revenue comes from ISVs over there. So it's actually much higher
percentage than I think most people might naturally think.
And the way that ultimately I think we need to kind of compete with is going to be
both in terms of getting SaaS to run their apps on top of Azure, on top of our
infrastructure as well as things like, for example, that mobility suite and the Power BI
suite that I showed where we enable ISVs to integrate with the Enterprise Mobility
suite for free. And we've got more than 2,000 SaaS vendors, including ones not
running on any Microsoft stack on the back-end or cloud, integrated with that.
And then we can also then monetize through the enterprise by selling on that
Enterprise Mobility suite and that also is kind of a core part of our (inaudible) motion
where we don't have to own the whole stack from the ISV. We can simply integrate
with and we can construct interesting business models and monetize as well. And so
I deﬁnitely think that ecosystem eﬀect is going to be really important for us to go
after it.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Got it. And then I think maybe the term dog-fooding your own software came from
Microsoft. That's the ﬁrst place I heard it back maybe 15 years ago. Azure is a large
football ﬁeld-sized infrastructure. Do you have other businesses at Microsoft that
could leverage Azure Search, Xbox Live, Oﬃce 365? Can you talk us through sort of
where you are internally with being your own customer so to speak with these
businesses leveraging the Azure capacity?
{BIO 15931914 <GO>}
Yeah. In terms of pretty much every Microsoft property and app runs on top of our
common infrastructure, so the football sized data centers basically is all of our
solutions are running inside of. There are then part -- there is the software piece of
Azure, which is kind of multiple diﬀerent things and all of their apps are in the
process of (inaudible) on top of that. And so anytime you use Oﬃce 365, all of the
authentication infrastructure goes through Azure Active Directory. You store things in
one drive, it's going into Azure Storage. If you use the new Oﬃce 365 video app,
you're going against our Media Service pack and inside Azure, et cetera. And with
Xbox Live, likewise, you run Halo or you run the Titanfall games that came out earlyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03

Q - Walter Pritchardthis year for Xbox One, that's all 100% on Azure. In fact, Titanfall was a game that
came out and it has been one of the premier games on Xbox and they actually spent
up 250,000 virtual machines inside Azure for the launch day, which is kind of an
example of sort of just extreme levels of capacity.
And then I think about a cloud, it enables those types of elastic scale where you can
peak on your end of month or holiday season and then you can drop oﬀ as needed
and only pay for what you use. And so we're certainly looking to use that inside
Microsoft, Skype likewise is now running on Azure. And basically we have a plan and
it will take probably two or three years before everything is, but we are pretty
aggressively moving all new stuﬀ, but also existing stuﬀ kind of moving it over on top
of the common software stack as well.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Yes. And so you mentioned 57% of the Fortune 500 is using Azure. So 43% is not
using Azure. So when you go on sales calls or hear feedback from your ﬁeld force
around what's holding people back, what's the top three there in terms of why
people aren't leveraging Azure? It's not going to be 100% today, but I'm more
interested in just what those factors are.
{BIO 15931914 <GO>}
Well, I think, I mean there is -- I think until we had the infrastructure solution released
12 to 18 months ago, there were a bunch of solutions where people would say, well, it
sounds cool, but I don't know what I do with it yet, and so if you look at just the
adoption in the last quarter or two, we're also seeing that hockey stick of growth and
so I do think you'll see even more use cases come out pretty quickly.
There are still some people that are just -- and I don't diﬀerentiate between IT and
departments. A lot of the adoption of cloud even in that 57% is still coming from
business units and departments, in particular more of a product side or the customer
facing side of the organizations. And I think in some cases, IT is now just starting to
come to the party, which is a great opportunity for us, but I think that we are seeing
for a lot of people, we've moved in the last year with cloud in general from, hey, is
this going to be a big thing or hey, will I use it to be more a case of win and how and
so I fully expect that to continue to grow.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Got it. And so I did note -- I think you can talk generally around this topic. I woke up
this morning and checked my (inaudible) reader and saw there was sort of a
landmark case right now around data sovereignty. And I guess there was a Microsoft
data center in Ireland or something where the U.S. government is saying I want the
emails and that data center is in Ireland, and it just sort of brought to the ﬂoor some
of these recent issues we've heard around the NSA and these sort of outreach by the
U.S. government, has that set the industry back at all? I know there's been some sort
of concerns highlighted by tech execs that this could actually occur in American
companies. And what have you seen in that regard?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03

We've not seen any revenue slowdown from it. I mean, I think when some of the NSA
stuﬀ ﬁrst came out, we wondered, this was going to cause people to pause and
generally I don't think the people that were worried before that were still paused
and the people that weren't worried ended up not being worried at the end. I do
think it is something that, from an industry perspective and just from an overall legal
perspective, is something that I think all of us need to worry about, not just the
industry, but across the world, across the U.S.
And I think Brad Smith has kind of spoken quite a bit publicly in terms of where our
position is. And I think it's going to continue to evolve and I think our ask to the
government is both to clarify its position as well as make sure that we have good
principles in place and I think it's going to be an ongoing dialog that will continue.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Got it. Last question and we'll let the crowd run through. We've got some breakout
sessions starting, but the session before this had Pat Gelsinger in the hot seat there,
we were talking about VMware and that you did put up the stat, we've seen many
times on the market share gains certainly in the virtualization space. Could you just
highlight for us where do you think you're gaining share? Either what types of
customers or what types of workloads within the installed base?
{BIO 15931914 <GO>}
Well, I think our historic play with Cloud and Enterprise that's worked very well for us
is how can we basically provide a great solution for our customers and not charge a
huge premium for it. And certainly if you look at our data business today, a lot of that
hockey stick of SQL growth is coming from Tier 1 workloads where we do have an
enterprise edition with a premium product pricing, but it's still about a third the cost
of an Oracle Tier 1 solution.
And your solution being enterprise credibility for being Tier 1 and you are
signiﬁcantly below the competitor, you'll see a hockey stick of revenue growth come
from that. And it's not just that you can be cheaper. you have to be Tier 1 quality to
get that reputation and we're at that place right now in the data space and it's
paying huge dividends.
I think also we've reached that space in the virtualization category as well where
people now say, gosh, you are cheaper than VMware and, boy, your oﬀering is pretty
darn good. You are in the leader quadrant in Gartner. You do stuﬀ that they can't and
it's integrated and it's a part of Windows Data Center. Why wouldn't I just buy one of
server data center and get that without having to pay extra. And I think that's where a
lot of the growth has happened.
The other thing I think to watch for us is Windows Server 2003 is going end of life
next summer and our Hyper-V share of Windows Server 2003 is exactly 0% because
we didn't have Hyper-V in Windows Server 2003. And so as all of those WindowsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03

Page 15 of 15Q - Walter Pritchard
A - Scott GuthrieServer 2003 instances get updated, I think that's also going to be an opportunity for
us to gain some more signiﬁcant virtualization shares because there are pure
VMware environments that are now up for grabs and pay a little bit more and get
Windows Server data center and you get virtualization included as part of it. And I
think that's going to give us some nice growth and momentum over the next 12 to 18
months as well.

Great. Well, Scott, thanks a lot for coming. I'll get over my red shirt issue, and great to
have you here. Thanks.
