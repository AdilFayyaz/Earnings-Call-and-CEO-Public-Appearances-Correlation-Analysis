Okay. Good Afternoon, Everyone. I'm Mark Murphy, Enterprise Software Analyst with
JPMorgan. And we are thrilled, it is a great pleasure to be here today with Alysa
Taylor, who is Corporate Vice President of Business Applications and Global Industry
for Microsoft.
Alysa, thank you so much for joining us.
Thank you. Thank you, Mark. It's a pleasure to be here. Really appreciate.
{BIO 18840231 <GO>}
The pleasure is all ours. Before we get started, I do want to just mention to the
audience, we may have time toward the end to take a couple of questions. And you
should be able to do that using a question button that I believe will be right below
the video feed on your screen.
So, Alysa, with that, perhaps we can begin here with just a brief introduction of your
background and your role at Microsoft.
Sure. Happy to do that. So, I've been at Microsoft for a number of years. I actually
started in our developer division, way back when[ph]. And then moved to run our
Azure division. So, it was at the time of cloud and enterprise in the US subsidiary.
And then four years ago moved to be the product marketing -- the Global Product
Marketing lead for Dynamics 365. So, right as we were moving from an on-prem
business into a cloud business and really sort of what we call mainstreaming theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-05-25

model. So, I was brought in to run the Product Marketing for Business Applications,
which is inclusive of Dynamics 365 and our Power platform.
And then expanded the portfolio into our Global Industry unit as well. So, I have
responsibility for Business Applications, Global Industry, and as of this week have
also assumed responsibility for our data, AI, and mixed reality business unit as well.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 18840231 <GO>}
Okay. Very well-rounded and expanding as we speak. That's great to hear. So, Alysa,
maybe we can begin just on the economy and IT demand. I was thinking back to
about a year ago when the pandemic was taking hold and Dynamics had solid
momentum, but Microsoft was mentioning that there was this slowdown in new
projects that had some of the longer times such as Dynamics. And so my question to
you is if you were looking through that lens of these longer lead time projects, are
you sensing any type of improvement today? Is it heading back towards normal? Is it
-- could it be pushing back above normal just with all the stimulus out there and the
economic rebound that we're seeing?
It's a great question. So, I'd say -- there's two things that I'll lay out for you. One is,
where -- when we started -- the starting of Dynamics 365, we took a very intentional
approach to take what were big monolithic CRM and ERP systems and actually
converged those, rebuild them on the Microsoft Azure platform and break them into
very modular functions across sales, marketing, service, ﬁnance, operations, and
commerce. And we did this very intentionally for two reasons.
One was knowing that organizations needed faster time to value. And the
organizations with the rate of change didn't have 5 or 10-year deployment cycles.
And so, really moving to what our customers needed which was kind of very speciﬁc
functional applications that could be deployed very quickly. And so, we started on
that journey like I said four years ago. And then when the pandemic hit, I think we
looked at what was a historical view when it was these big CRM or ERP deployments
and those historically would because it took so long and a longer lead times and
that type of stuﬀ would be put on hold.
But the most interesting thing happened with the pandemic, which was that
organizations needed completely new digital capability. So, if you think about
curbside pickup or contactless shopping, that didn't exist, right? And so, actually, we
saw the exact opposite happen of what we have historically seen with business
applications. We actually saw an accelerated momentum to people rapidly adopting
cloud-based commerce systems, new modern supply chains being able to engage
customer service that had to move completely to a remote, that entire customer
service departments were shut down and moved into a remote capacity. And cloud-
based applications are needed to be able to facilitate that ongoing customerFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-05-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 11Q - Mark Murphy
A - Alysa Taylor
Q - Mark Murphyinteraction, whether it be sales or service. And so, we actually saw an acceleration of
our customer base and our business in the pandemic, which was very counter[ph] to
what traditional business applications that's seen in the past.
And the last thing I'll say is, as we saw this, we actually partnered with the economists
to quantify what we were seeing in the market. And they actually came back in a
recent study that we just published this week with 70% of organizations actually
invested and accelerated their digital capabilities because of the pandemic. And
they actually quantify that, in the ﬁrst three months of the pandemic $15 billion a
week was being poured into these new digital capabilities. So, really sort of was, it
validated what we've seen with our customer base of this acceleration and then sort
of showing that it is a real trend of both what companies are investing in and the
dollars they are investing in.
{BIO 18840231 <GO>}
So, okay. Interesting. So, it sounds like this modular approach is really resonating. If
you look at what's happening a little more broadly, do you feel as though you're
seeing customers reigniting some of the very big transformational projects if to any
extent if some of those were held oﬀ on a bit last year? Any of that reigniting and/or
are there any other kinds of patterns or signals that you see emerging today in this
environment?
I think it's always a balance of both. We see both, right? So, you see organizations
that particularly, where they have on-prem systems understanding the value of cloud
and allowing cloud-based services to drive more agility with their operations, with
their customer base. And so, you do see organizations sort of modernizing their ERP
systems, modernizing their supply chain or their customer service environment from
either line of business or on-prem competitive basis. So, you do see those big
transformational projects happening and then you do see where organizations need
new capabilities.
Chipotle is a great example of a customer that invested in the customer data
platform, which was Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. They have other systems of
record but using Dynamics 365 Customer Insights to be able to connect into those
systems of record to be able to create a 360-degree view of their customer base so
they could actually create an entirely new loyalty program. So, that's -- you see both
modernization and investing in new capabilities kind of happening simultaneously.
{BIO 18840231 <GO>}
And when we look at how that was translating, recently into the numbers. In the
March quarter, Dynamics 365 growth accelerated to 40% in constant currency and
there was this comment about particular strength in Power apps and the ﬁnance
operations oﬀering, which was a new insight. When we think about that business
line, it's roughly the scale of a Workday or a ServiceNow right, but it's growing faster
here at about 40%. What do you attribute that type of acceleration doing? Were
there any particular workloads or verticals where you are seeing pronounced
strength?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-05-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 11A - Alysa Taylor
Q - Mark MurphyYes. And so you -- when you look at our growth rate, we are growing, from a growth
rate standpoint, faster than any of our major competitors. And we are newer to the
market, right? I said Dynamics 365 is 4.5 years old, but we're very pleased with our
growth rates. Even more so when you look at 97% of the Fortune 500 are using our
business applications, products in some capacity. So our customer adoption and the
associated revenue, we are very excited about both.
It is also a strategic asset in the Microsoft Cloud. And so, when you ask about
particular workloads, I think there's two ways I would answer. One is, we see
adoption because of the ability to have, if you think about the Microsoft Cloud with
the -- our Hyperscale cloud platform being Microsoft Azure, our extensibility in our
tooling layer being Power Platform, Visual Studio, GitHub and our application layer
being Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365, these cloud services are all constructed and
integrated in very unique ways where we share data, business processes, and the
ability to have global scale all wrappered with security and compliance. And so, that
-- being able to have that integration is something that we see customers really
gravitate to.
And then the breadth of our portfolio. We've invested heavily. We started in two
towns, we're now in six, very large expansive towns. And we have products that are
both what I would call core systems of record and then like what I talked about which
are fully[ph] Customer Insights, where we have products that are augmenting
existing -- other investments that customers have. And so, the breadth of our
portfolio across customer engagement, ﬁnance, operations, commerce, customer
data platform, as well as, business intelligence, RPA, and low-code no-code really is
what's given us our growth is the oﬀerings across all of those large major towns.
And then lastly, what I would say is, in the earnings when we decided things like our
operations portfolio, that's very much what we were just talking about the pandemic,
where people are investing in commerce capabilities to be able to modernize their
supply chain, to be able to do things like curbside pickup, that's where you see
growth in those areas. We also saw very heavily in our customers -- on our service
lines as well, being able to do remote service was a very unique workload to the
pandemic that people heavily invested in.
Mercedes-Benz USA is a great example where they used Dynamics 365 Remote
Assist to be able to, you know in a mixed reality environment collaborate with
subject matter experts around the world and be able to communicate with their
customers in a completely augmented way. So, that kept their service department up
and running when you couldn't physically be in the same location. And so, those
types of workloads are what are really fueling our acceleration in our growth.
{BIO 18840231 <GO>}
Yeah. The range of these use cases and how quickly companies pivoted, it's just
amazing. There is so much in that portfolio and you mentioned Power platform which
I want to come back to in just a moment, because I think there's is a lot to talk aboutFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-05-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 11A - Alysa Taylor
Q - Mark Murphythere. But there is one other element I think of what you've been doing with the
applications, there was this comment about proactive versus reactive business
systems, that vision has been pretty intriguing to us. Can you help us understand
what is involved there in making these systems become more proactive? Are you
talking about the cognitive services? Are you talking about machine learning
predictions and algorithms? And maybe you could just help us understand some of
those scenarios that you're making possible.
Absolutely. I talked about our vision for business applications was a modern
portfolio of these very speciﬁc purpose-built applications. But really what underpins
that is what I would call a data-ﬁrst approach, which is very, very diﬀerent. Then if you
think about business applications, they've historically been -- I talked about the
system of record, right? It's forms of data, input data into a system. We really want to
turn that on its head and start with the data-ﬁrst approach, which means that you're
able to ingest large amounts of data and then have the application be in service of
that data.
And so, having you know a comment what we did with Dynamics is when we broke it
down into these modular functions marketing, sales, service, ﬁnance, others, we
underpinned it with a common data service, which we call Dataverse and that allows
you to adopt at the time of need, have a data platform that spans all applications
including Power Platform and Teams. And so, the data then is aggregated, you can
apply intelligence over that data. And then the application because it's in service of
the data does exactly what you say, if becomes proactive. You can service things up,
like you can understand -- you can use cognitive services to be able to understand
call sentiment in a call center, knowing that you have the cognitive services is
reacting to the transcripts and knowing that the person on the other line might not
be the happiest person that you're dealing with. You have the ability to see the entire
lifecycle of the customer, all the touchpoints and then be able to use -- happy
application service up things like what you would do to be able to proactively help
them move that forward in their customer service, complaint or request.
And so, that's a very diﬀerent world of business applications. It's using data and
intelligence and putting not in the hands of the customer service, sales or ﬁeld
service, somebody on the supply chain to be able to predict things like customer
sentiment, what you should be selling a customer, what might be happening on a
supply chain that may be potentially harmful to a supply chain? That's the new world
of applications that are proactive, that are in service of the data that use intelligence
to be able to really empower people in a very unique way. And that's what we're
doing with Dynamics and our -- this data-ﬁrst approach with intelligence and having
this new modern intelligent applications that are proactive in nature.
{BIO 18840231 <GO>}
It sounds like a very skillful way that you are leveraging a lot of the common core
services that are up and down the Microsoft stack. The -- and I think we're starting to
understand that Power Platform is one of those, is going to become one of those
layers. Interestingly, in our most recent Microsoft partner survey, these PowerFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-05-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 11A - Alysa TaylorPlatform products rated almost as strong as Azure in terms of the product
momentum that Microsoft partners are seeing. We were surprised by that. And so, I
think we have some understanding, it spans across RPA, low-code no-code, virtual
agents, Power BI is in there so, you have analytics. But how would you describe, if it's
possible to do so, the role of those products in the future to just -- to someone in the
audience who hasn't put their hands on them yet in this Power platforms. What do
they look like? What's their role going to be? And what's driving this growth?
Absolutely. You could tell me how I do here. But when we think about the Power
Platform, it goes back to what I was saying, which is if you sort of take this data-ﬁrst
approach, the same data service that I talked about with Dynamics underpins both
Teams and the Power Platform. And when you -- what we aim to do with the Power
Platform is very simply put the tools in the hands of those closest to the problem.
And what that means is, if you think about a -- the old world of application
development, it was very much a -- developers and enterprise developers, they
would have to, over a long period of time, build out an enterprise application to
meet the need of an organization. And there are more apps needed than there are
developers. There is still scarcity in the market of developers.
And so, things like Power Apps, which is our low-code no-code development
platform. What it does is, it does -- it makes those that have -- that are closest to the
problem, whether you see something like, if I look at T-Mobile. T-Mobile is a great
example of when the pandemic shutdown the stores and they went to limited
capacity, they had to do resource planning, putting employees where they were
needed the most in stores and being able to manage those capacity constraints. The
operations manager built an application using Power Apps to do just that. So, he
wasn't waiting for an enterprise developer or central IT to build an application that
would have taken months if not years. It happened in days. And it was the operations
manager that was able to do that. And so, that is the example of putting the tools in
the hands closest to the problem and that's Power Apps from a low-code no-code.
Power BI is the same thing. It's about aggregating data, disparate data sources and
having people like ﬁnancial analyst be able to very easily aggregate that data and
then analyze it, visualize it, and be able to act on that data as the business
intelligence, and same thing, it's in a very citizen, analyst, having people that aren't
considered developers, be able to use these tools to be able to analyze and visualize
and act on the data.
And then Power Automate is our robotics process automation and business process
automation tooling, and the same exact, you're hearing a theme here right, which is
allowing people, end-users to be very quickly able to automate manual tasks, things
that take a lot of time and drain productivity. And so, being able to in a very quick
and easy way, in an if-then type statement to be able to automate data and take out
a lot of that repetitive nature that happens in organizations every day. And so, that's
Power Automate. And we announced at -- in the springtime, making Power Automate
available to all windows users. So, really getting out -- that tool out into the hands ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-05-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 11Q - Mark Murphy
A - Alysa Taylorthose users to be able to automate whatever tests they deem as manual and
repetitive.
And so, when you think about why you're seeing -- my guess is, why you're seeing
the sentiment, the survey is that it is very viral[ph] in nature and we have
explosive[ph], we're doubling our monthly active user base across the Power
Platform on a regular basis and those users, right, are then -- then organizations are
then standardizing on these tools because they have such a groundswell of users
using them.
{BIO 18840231 <GO>}
That's the best explanation I've heard of the Power Platform. So, thank you for
helping to make that become tangible. I want to switch gears a bit because a big
portion of your role includes Global Industry concept, and I've noticed that you have
been talking about an industry-ﬁrst cloud focus at Microsoft. And I think part of what
you had mentioned in the past is the concept of vertical-speciﬁc data models. Many
of us are trying to understand this, what does that notion mean? Why is this being
done and sort of what do you have to engineer to enable it?
Yes. We've always had a very industry-ﬁrst approach as a company. But what we
haven't had is, what I would call sort of the product -- the vertical product capability
to bring that to life. And so, our ﬁrst instantiation of that was the Microsoft Cloud for
Healthcare that we came to general availability in the fall. And you're precisely right,
it is not about another product that is a healthier product. It's about data models,
connectors, apps, and workﬂows that are very speciﬁc to that vertical. And so, an
example of that is Virtual Business in Healthcare, right? Again, back to kind of the
world of virtual care exploded overnight.
And so, with the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, you can actually use a -- the portal's
capability in Microsoft Power Apps to be able to aggregate patient data, to be able
to understand kind of all of the inputs of the data and then have a workﬂow, a
predetermined workﬂow that brings that into Microsoft Teams so that the caregiver
or the clinician can actually see all the patient information, have it at their ﬁngertips
and then actually create in Teams a virtual visit. And these predetermined -- so, rather
than having to build that, these workﬂows and these common data models allow you
to very easily stand up a patient portal, be able to have the workﬂows to bring that
into Teams to be able to see that data and then stand up a virtual consult. And so,
that's the type of what -- that type of capabilities that we are building and we came
to general availability, the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, and then we've
announced four other industry clouds all with that same capability.
In retail, being able to do curbside pickup and contactless shopping. In
manufacturing, how do you build out a digital factory? And how do you do out-of-
the-box process -- process automation on your factory ﬂoor looking at not-for-proﬁt
and having discrete donor management capabilities. And then in ﬁnancial services,
doing things like loan management and doing the workﬂows for how you actually
take loan origination and then move it very quickly through the loan lifecycle,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-05-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 11Q - Mark Murphy
A - Alysa Taylorincreasing -- decreasing the lead times to getting a loan originated into the hands of
those that are the -- that are doing the lending.
And so that type -- those are the type of workﬂows and very speciﬁc vertical
capabilities that we're bringing to market with the Microsoft Cloud for industry. And
the way to think about it is, it is those workﬂows and APIs and connectors bring that
vertical relevance across the Microsoft Cloud, and that's very unique. Like if you look
at somebody like Salesforce, they have a industry cloud but it sits on their CRM
system, right? Versus our industry approach is lighting up the entirety of the
Microsoft Cloud Services and integrating all of that vertical relevance and capability
across your cloud platform, your business process layer, and your collaboration layer.
{BIO 18840231 <GO>}
I see. Okay. So, that's the core diﬀerentiation. So, Alysa, since you mentioned patient
portals in Healthcare, maybe that's a pretty good segue to try to talk about the
proposed acquisition of Nuance, which as I was thinking again, it proves again
despite everyone's best eﬀorts no one is able to accurately predict Microsoft's next
move in terms of M&A. And so, no one has predicted really any of these in the past.
So, there is something you're seeing here that must be helping you to accelerate
that roadmap. And I'm wondering, so is that going to be completely speciﬁc to
Healthcare or could you not take some of Nuance's core IP[ph] for instance, and
they're very strong in voice recognition. Can that not help to strengthen Azure's
voice recognition, right? And I believe with Nuance also biometric user
authentication, can you not take that and apply it across many verticals?
Absolutely. So, if you just -- I'll start with Healthcare, then I'll go into what the other
expanded use cases. So, in Healthcare, as we talked about how do we enable
physicians, like how do we enable physician productivity. I talked about this with the
Power Platform so it is the very common theme. There is a lot of heavy lifting that
caregivers have to give in terms of transcription. And so what Nuance does in a very
unique way is bring in their transcription services and this notion of ambient
intelligence to be able to not only improve the clinician and physician productivity
but also use intelligence to be able to provide greater care. And so, it's really what
we -- and I'm glad we're keeping you on your toes with acquisitions. But when you
really think about where we want to acquire, it's acquiring for the future and what
can we do that provides unique value for Healthcare institutions going forward. And
so, this notion of both physician productivity and better care, Nuance has just an
incredible ability to do that in the Healthcare space.
Now, to your point, they have also a very rich portfolio of voice recognition, voice
transcription, and bio-recognition that plays into a large set of scenarios. I've talked
about customer service but how do you do transcription and voice recognition to
improve things like your interaction between the customer service agent and the
customer. How -- we have a set of fraud Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection using their
Nuance's capabilities to really augment that portfolio and predict fraud before it
happens. And so, their securities and biometrics is an incredible asset into kind ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-05-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 11Q - Mark Murphy
A - Alysa Taylorcoming together to help organizations be predictive, bolstering security, and fraud
protection.
And then, sort of largely across the transcript capabilities, an enormous amount of
capability both in our productivity suite as well as integrating in with Dynamics and
Azure communication Services. So, there is a lot of diﬀerent things that we can do
with the enterprise workloads known as the enterprise portfolio of Nuance and then
they're driving portfolio in the Healthcare side really helping us meet the needs of
the future overall[ph] Healthcare organizations.
{BIO 18840231 <GO>}
So -- Well, since you mentioned meeting the needs of the future, can you maybe
provide us just a bit of a window into some of the key investment areas in business
applications that you are most excited about moving forward? It sounds like there's a
whole range of initiatives. And we always get this question of where do you want to
invest most heavily into Dynamics. And I think people tend to think of it as more in
ERP or more in CRM, but the reality is, you're touching on so many other areas
including commerce and such a range of use cases. What are you most excited
about?
Well, I think, the thing that I'm most excited about is the world of what we would
historically call back oﬃce and front oﬃce, right, which is CRM and ERP is lower[ph].
And so, for an organization to be able to serve their customers, you have to digitally
connect all aspects of your business, right? You have to be able to connect your
back-end operations to your front-end experiences. In retail, this notion of bridging
the digital and physical worlds. And you have to be able to get the information real-
time in the hands of your employees. And then you have to have this great feedback
loop into your products and services that you're building.
And so, you can't do that if you're just investing in one area or the other. And so,
that's why you see us investing in all aspects of what I would call the customer
experience, the operations piece, as well as, the integration into the employee
experience and tooling to make sure that there is a feedback loop into things like
product development. And so, that what we call -- it's called a digital feedback loop.
It's the ability to connect all facets of an organization and that's where -- why we're
investing in all of these areas, because we believe that organizations that do that are
the most agile and the best positioned to be future proof and serve their customers
in the best way possible. And so, that's where and why we are investing.
And so, some of the things, the new areas that you asked around customer journey
orchestration is something that we just recently announced and that's the ability to
connect all of the marketing signals into the sales environment and be able to do
things like real-time attribution and real-time targeting of a customer. Really highly
personalizing the acquisition layer and then bringing that seamlessly into how you
either digitally sell or into bringing again into the physical sale as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-05-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 11Q - Mark Murphy
A - Alysa Taylor
Q - Mark MurphyIntelligent Order Management is another area of investment for us. Again, it's
around kind of that modern supply chain and giving visibility both to the supplier
and the end consumer the lifecycle, when you order our product to when it is in your
hands, all this sort of -- those updates of where it is in the lifecycle. And that's very
important both to the customer and to the end -- the consumer and the end
customer. And so, Intelligent Order Management is an area that we also are bringing
to market.
And so, it's these -- it's all in that vein of these very proactive intelligent applications
that connect across the entirety of an organization and it's really this notion of being
digital-ﬁrst and helping organizations be digital-ﬁrst. And so, we'll continue to invest
both in acquisitions like Nuance and building features like customer journey
orchestration and intelligent order management.
{BIO 18840231 <GO>}
So, there is so much happening there. It's a lot to wrap our minds around. The --
seeing that we have maybe just a couple of minutes left, I was wondering if you want
to try to close the loop on this discussion by just underscoring the key areas of
structural advantage or the core diﬀerentiators for Microsoft as you think about this
holistically across these key areas of business apps and Power Platform?
Thank you for the opportunity to do that. Yes, I would say there are two things that I
would want to underscore, which is this notion of a modern set of business
applications that allow organizations to break down their data silos to be -- to have
proactive applications that enable them to be digital-ﬁrst in years. Like that's -- at the
end of the day, that is what we aim to do and it helps organizations to be more agile,
take cost out of the system and ultimately and most importantly, serve their
customers better. And so, we're doing that across Dynamics, the Power Platform, it's
this notion of like data-ﬁrst application that is highly proactive and intelligent and
allows organizations to be more agile and better -- and ultimately better serve their
customers. And so, that's what we are doing on the business application side, and
then bringing that to life through an industry-relevant (inaudible).
Those -- I think those are the things that I would want people to understand. That's
what our strategy is, and where we're -- where we aim to both invest from a product
standpoint and how we serve our customers.
{BIO 18840231 <GO>}
Well, Alysa, I can't thank you enough. You have provided incredible clarity of
thoughts and truly help to enable us to understand how quickly Microsoft is moving
in all these areas and really make it tangible and bring it to life. So, thank you so
much for carving out this time with us, and we certainly hope that one year from
today, we'll be able to do this event back in person in a physical format in Boston.
And we look forward to learning about the enhancements that you've got between
now and then. So, thank you again, and hope you have a wonderful night.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-05-25
