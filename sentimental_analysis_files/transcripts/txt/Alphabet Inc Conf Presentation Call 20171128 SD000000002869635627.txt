So that's a pretty extensive CV that you have there. And you've been at Google for a
long time. So I guess, you are the key focal point of all of the business activities at
Google. So where do you spend most of your time these days?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Probably on a plane. Joking aside, a couple of -- few diﬀerent areas. The ﬁrst one I
would mention is I deeply care about our advertiser, customer and partner
relationships, because the brutal reality is that Google cannot be successful without
our advertising partners and frankly, all of our other partners being successful. And
the reason for that is very, very simple. If you look at most of the contractual
relationships we actually have in place, they're somehow somewhere based on a
CPC, CPV, ROI or rev share model. So by deﬁnition, we have a keen interest in all
partners and other ecosystems growing. If we cannot successfully -- we need to help
successfully transition our SMB partners, small and medium-size business, for
example, into the digital world. We want to make sure they succeed in this world.
The same goes for large advertisers. The same goes for publishers where most of
our DoubleClick business is obviously based on some sort of revenue share model.
The same goes for app developers. The same goes for YouTube creators. And so we
actually want our customers to succeed. So I spend a very signiﬁcant amount of time
on that. That's the ﬁrst area. The second area is obviously our service operations. We
want to provide very smart, amazing service to all of our partners, customers,
advertisers and so on. So that's a very, very big part. The third area I would describe
as high-growth markets, markets in APAC, China, India, LatAm markets like Brazil. I
spend quite a bit of time there. And the fourth part is probably on leadership
because we are doing something pretty unprecedented at a very high scale, high
growth. And we need to think about how to put the right leaders in place, how to put
the right systems in place, how to put the right organization in place to scale
globally. Where do you want to be more global? Where you want to be more local?
What type of setup do you need? What organizational structure do you need?
Where do you intend -- want to invest? Where you do not want to invest? So those
are probably the big 4 areas where to start.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Okay, got it. So you've got partnerships in many diﬀerent forms. And I think Sundar
recently brought up that Google will be a great partner for retail. So let's talk about
Google Express. It's not a new product. It's been out there for some time. But you
recently added Walmart as well as Target as partners on the system as well. So what
changed to catalyze these partnerships?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
So we really want to create amazing experiences. We want to create amazing
experiences for merchants. We want to create amazing experiences for consumers,
frictionless experiences. And we have a platform for that, which is Google Express.
We heavily invested in some of the relationships you mentioned on a senior
management level. We all take the Walmart example, we all spend a lot of personal
time, myself, Shridhar, Sundar, with our -- with the teams at Walmart. We went there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-28

Q - Stephen D. Ju
A - Philipp SchindlerWe visited them. They visited us over many, many years. And we got to a point where
we thought we can create a great relationship here. And I think we have actually
done that. If you take a look at what we oﬀer, we have now hundreds (if not)
thousands of products from Walmart available on Google Express. We have some
really interesting new voice-activated new user experiences where you can, for
example, reorder things simply via voice command. And you can already see where
this can go going forward. There's a lot more interesting things you can do.
Obviously, you can think about a simple query to your Google Home, something
along the lines of, "Hey Google, I'd like to pick up my shopping basket at my closest
Walmart." They have like 4,700 stores. Maybe there's even something interesting
from a pricing perspective, if I pick it up myself. You can think about fresh groceries
and other pickup situations that you just trigger via voice command. We also have
the ability to actually link the accounts together so you can link your Walmart
account with your Google Express account, just reorder things that you've reordered
before. So there's a whole lot of diﬀerent scenarios in such a setup that I think can be
exactly in this territory of creating a frictionless experience, both for the merchant
side as well as for the consumer side.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Right. I mean, the consumer angle is actually fairly interesting. And I don't think
consumers are fully aware of the full experience that Google Express could oﬀer. So
how has the reaction from the consumer been as you continue to iterate on the
product?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
So I think we're very happy so far. And again, as you said, this is already (staged in).
There's a lot more to come, a lot more iterations. But it's deﬁnitely a very, very
interesting world to explore.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Got it. Right. So switching gears a little bit to some of your advertising and ad agency
partners. There are some amount of concerns in the market that the ad agencies are
being disintermediated. So can you talk about how Google works with the agencies
and what your standing is there with your clients on the ad agency world?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
So that's not our plan. We don't want to disintermediate advertising agencies. We're
actually working very, very closely with agencies all over the world. It is important to
understand that we see ourselves as a supplier of technology. And we would like
agencies to actually apply our technology and smartly use our technology. We have
teams all over the world actually that work very, very closely with agencies, whether
it's the large ones, the well-known ones or whether it's a few very signiﬁcant amount
of smaller agencies as well. We see agencies as trusted advisers to the customers
and clients. And in any ideal scenario, we work exactly in those triangle-type of set
up with us, with the agency and with a partner. And this covers a very big range of
diﬀerent use cases from them simply using all products, which takes a lot of time and
eﬀorts on their end, to very, very complex integration. Just to give you an example,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-28

Q - Stephen D. Ju
A - Philipp Schindlerwithout mentioning a name, there is a very, very -- one of the largest agencies in the
world. We're currently working with one of the largest advertisers in the world,
thinking about, for example, a smart Google Cloud Platform deployment where we
basically think about demand forecasting models. This is something that customers
are very, very interested in. It's creating a very customer-centric platform where we
can help them go down the route of dramatically better assessing demand for them.
Agency's heavily involved, we are heavily involved, advertising teams are involved,
cloud teams are involved. We're pretty good at this kind of stuﬀ. And agencies
working closely with us and the customers on this.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
That's a very interesting angle because I think investors tend to think in terms of B2C
but there's also a consumer to business angle in which you're probably sitting on top
with a lot of intent data, which you just described as, I guess, the demand data. And
if it's such that, okay, the consumers want the red sweater this season, why don't we
go back to the brands and say, "Okay, manufacture more red sweaters instead of
blue sweaters," so that could be -- it seems that could be a very useful, I guess, data
for your advertising clients to take advantage of. So where do you think we are in
terms of reaping that opportunity as far as the larger advertisers are concerned?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
So the #1 thing to keep in mind, you have to do all this in a privacy-friendly way. You
can't (make) any type of data. But there is deﬁnitely interesting paths that we're
taking. We have product out there like you know, the Google Trends product. And
you can obviously do this at a larger scale. And you can do this especially well with,
frankly, the cloud and infrastructure that we have, products like (the query) are
fantastic for this type of large-scale data mining, some of the machine learning
technology is really good for that. And yes, indeed, we have some data, again, if
used correctly in a privacy-friendly way, yes.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Okay. Understood. So you've been vocal about the mobile revolution. And I think
we're now on the cusp of voice as well as Assistant-driven, I guess, revolution in that
regard. So I think when consumer behavior changes like this, there's also always the
question of what you're going to be doing in the background to monetize this new
behavior over the longer term. So like what are the longer-term opportunities for
monetization with Assistant?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Well look, as I indicated before, I mean, for us, it's all about creating great consumer
experiences. And we are in the, I'd say, comfortable position that our -- we had to
invest and develop technology along the lines of natural language processing,
computer vision, understanding consumers and their contacts, all based on machine
learning and deep learning approaches that we needed for a lot of our existing core
products. And I think it is the natural evolution that we think about more assistive-
type of experiences going forward. Similar as the transition we've seen from desktop
to mobile, I think it is pretty obvious that we will see a next evolution that makes it aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-28
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 12Q - Stephen D. Ju
A - Philipp Schindlerlot easier to actually interact with computing-type of interfaces. And that's a very
interesting revolution. We're obviously thinking about monetization models there.
There's a whole lot of diﬀerent approaches that you can take, action-type of
approaches, other approaches. But I think it's really important to remember that we
have seen the evolution from desktop; the 10 blue links; to the mobile device that's,
say, mostly with a smaller set, 4. By the way, really interesting, the need for
consumers to get higher quality on the results goes up signiﬁcantly the smaller your
surface area. So from desktop to mobile already, we can see that the consumers are
asking for a signiﬁcantly higher quality in their results. Then obviously, you can
picture going to a world where it's much more of an assistive-type of interaction.
And the key thing to keep in mind is. And going back speciﬁcally to your
monetization question, is that voice in does not always need to mean voice out. And
there's a whole lot of diﬀerent use cases. So I personally feel that voice in, visual out
will be a very, very interesting use case going forward. I ask something, I might not
want a voice answer back. But I might want a projected answer back either on my
mobile device, or I'm aware that there's my television screen somewhere in the room
or some other screen or projector close to you. That's a use case you can imagine.
You can imagine a lot of really interesting assistive use cases that are actually not
only voice in. But think about the natural evolution from text in today. You can take it
to voice in. You can take it to image in. You can theoretically take it to video in or
some sort of stream analysis going in like the Google Lens product that we have --
we've just announced where you can just literally, via Google Assistant, hold up your
camera, tap on something and vision recognition will help you identify the object. So
there's a whole lot of diﬀerent input methods. And there's a whole lot of diﬀerent
output methods that you can picture in such a future assistive-type of environment.
And diﬀerent combination will work diﬀerently for each use case.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yes. It seems like it's been almost ﬁve years ago, I think, when I think Larry ﬁrst
articulated the concept of search and assist. And you might not need to speciﬁcally
put in a query and the need -- I mean, the query count, such as you disclosed it,
probably becomes increasingly meaningless over time. But I guess, what I guess
what you're saying is, if you want to cut right through it, I think there is a perception
that voice-driven queries can be harmful to your search franchise. I mean, I'm of the
mindset to think that if you're making it easier for the consumers and this take down
of friction of what they're trying to achieve, they will do more of it, right? So would
you agree that from an absolute query comp perspective, it could be expansionary
or the number of, I guess, assistive assists or the answer that you provide could be
expansionary over time?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
I mean, look at your own user experience and you kind of mentioned it, right? You're
moving from a desktop with a, let's say, limited use case environment to a mobile
device that already has a signiﬁcantly enhanced ability to do things, you always have
it with you. And now you're moving on to -- which will, of course, in many cases,
involve the mobile device. And now you're moving on to a much more assistive,
more natural language processing-based interaction. I mean, look just at some of the
numbers. We already have I think 20% of our queries on the app, on the Android
app in the United States, already voice-based. So you move towards this moreFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-28

Q - Stephen D. Junatural interaction. What's your assumption? Will you use it more? Will it easier be --
for you to you to use it more? Will that increase the number of times you use it? So I
would say the net eﬀect is likely to be expansionary.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yes, I think invariably, if you're making it easier for people to do things, they will
engage more with the platform. So switching gears slightly to the search business
and online advertising sort of in terms of an addressable market. Do you think
search, as well as online advertising, is expansionary for the advertising market? Or is
it cannibalistic? Because -- like our bias is to think that, to some degree. And you
mentioned SMBs before, like some of these are advertisers that would otherwise
have never found a route to advertise on the traditional media platforms before. But
now there's an outlet, whether it's on Google, Facebook or any other platforms, for
them to be advertising and generating clients. So would you agree? Would you
disagree? I mean, would the notion that the amount of dollars that Google can
capture over time in the ad sector is capped?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Look, we talked about advertising market. People usually refer to advertising markets
as the existing -- in the industry, we call it the above-the-line advertising markets,
right? Which is -- and that's usually the numbers you see, which is something along
the lines of television or radio or print or out-of-homes is usually factored into this. I
look at it in a much broader perspective. There's a very signiﬁcant market that is
usually referred to as below-the-line, which includes a lot of other things, everything
from direct marketing to events to trade fairs to (what's or not a) very signiﬁcant
market. There is the whole world of e-commerce. 90% of commerce is still oﬄine. I
think that's an interesting opportunity. In general, I would say, we are actually more in
the business of connecting businesses to consumers. That's how we think about it.
And as long as we can do this by generating a positive ROI for the businesses, I think
we're ﬁne. I don't look at it in the sense of the traditional above-the-line advertising
market deﬁnition.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yes. So this is theoretically where Google Express kind of ﬁts in. You're looking for a
way to directly connect the brands with the consumer?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, we've done this basically forever, right? I mean, look at our well-known
SMB business, right? Look at many other things that we're doing, right? This is the
world we operate in. I don't think it actually ﬁts the traditional advertising market
deﬁnitions in that sense.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yes. Sticking with search a little bit. There is a perception out there that when you
increased the ad load on search a couple of years ago from 2 links, through
sponsored links on mobile, to 3, I mean, that was theoretically mutually exclusive withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-28

Q - Stephen D. Ju
A - Philipp Schindlerthe consumer experience. I mean, does the perception square with the data on
(each of these) that you're seeing right now?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Actually, I would say the opposite is true. I mean, we deeply care, as I mentioned
before, about the user experience. And we do an incredible number of tests and
experiments and analyze it very, very deeply. And we can tell from all the analysis
we've done in the run-up to this that actually the consumer experience on a mobile
device looks quite diﬀerently from a desktop device, simply because you have the
ability to scroll and you have the ability to swipe. So we were actually able to do this
and preserving, at the same time, an excellent consumer experience. Keep in mind
that for most of the queries, we actually don't even show ads. And for commercial
queries, consumers actually deeply care about ads if they are relevant. Relevant ads
are very, very helpful information for consumers. And we were actually able to show
this and prove this in our experience. So we are very, very conﬁdent that we
maintain, as always, a consumer experience on the absolute highest level actually.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Okay. You mentioned many, many diﬀerent experiments that's going on in the
background, both for the consumer and probably for the advertiser as well. So the
obvious sort of implied question and the follow-up to that is, I mean, is there -- I
mean, some would say that there's probably really not much you can now -- not
much else you can do to optimize search. But it sounds like you would deﬁnitely
disagree with that notion as well. I mean, there's still a lot to do from a consumer and
advertiser standpoint.
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
So I think, actually, Ruth said it nicely. Ruth, our CFO, said it nicely in the last earnings
call. We are very excited still about the opportunity. There is a massive secular trend,
which is the shift to mobile. We are -- we have a very high innovation environment.
We have incredible product managers, engineers. We run on the ads and commerce
site hundreds of hundreds of experiments every single quarter, which lead to
probably over 100 improvements in our systems every single quarter. We are
obviously using the world of machine learning very, very actively, which opens up
really interesting opportunities as well to optimize our system and optimize the
performance for our advertisers and for our partners. So I'm very optimistic -- I'm --
about the opportunity.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Okay. Thinking about opportunities. And I mean, you've said you spend a lot of your
time on the plane and you think about the APAC and the emerging markets quite a
bit. So talk about what your business looks like in the emerging markets, especially
the APAC region. I mean, it seems like -- that those markets are less further along,
obviously. So there's probably more of an opportunity for Google to do more
interesting things there versus the already developed markets.

Page 8 of 12Q - Stephen D. Ju
A - Philipp Schindler
Q - Stephen D. JuYes. It's interesting that you're asking because I literally just came back from APAC,
spent time in China and Tokyo. And so we're very excited about APAC and emerging
markets, including LatAm markets and in general. We have invested there for a very
long time, I mean, for over 10 years. If I remember correctly, I think Tokyo was the
second oﬃce we opened outside of the U.S. So the ﬁrst outside of the U.S., to be
precise. So very excited about it. We have a few very interesting developments there.
If you think, for example, about India, we just announced a product called Tez, which
is a payments and commerce-type of platform product. And we're seeing nice
numbers there. We have over 7 million users, I think 30 million transactions just since
we launched. So (clearly) interesting development there. We have -- we see real
interesting growth rate there as well. And this goes for the more mature markets in
the region like APAC, like Japan for example, it goes more for -- it goes for the
emerging markets we have, whether it's the Philippines or Vietnam. We have really
interesting growth on the advertiser side. I think the number of advertisers -- the
growth rate on the advertiser side is somewhere in the 25% range. So really, really
nice development. And we'll continue to invest. I'm a big fan of APAC and emerging
markets in general. That's why I said in the beginning, I actually spend a lot of time
there.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yes, I mean, you talked -- I mean, the sort of a recurring theme is, I guess, connecting
the brands directly with the consumer. And I think in the APAC markets, especially
some of the developing markets, there is less of an infrastructure that's already built
out there. So there's probably an increased level of opportunity for you to -- as you
provide, I mean, a great set of products to the consumer and get their engagement,
there is an increased opportunity, vis-Ã -vis products like Tez, to capture, I guess,
incremental sort of market share in those markets. So I mean, is that -- do you believe
that over the longer term, like Google's franchise in the emerging markets and APAC
could be as large as what it is already in the developed markets?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Look, without making an assessment about the size of this. But there's no doubt, it's
a really interesting opportunity. I mean, look at the innovation going on in this
region, right? Look at where Japan has been on the mobile development side,
leading the world. Look at a lot of the other areas there. Look at the energy level.
Look at the entrepreneurship. Look at how SMBs already interact with us. Look at all
the diﬀerent partners we have. Look at the importance of the app developer
ecosystem coming from that side of the world, right? I mean, APAC is absolutely on
ﬁre. And we have incredible teams there. We had -- when I came from there, we had
our big business conference with all of our business leadership there. We have
thousands of people in the region. We all came together. And I mean, you have to
see it to believe it. It's just an incredible region, incredible energy level. And I think
we'll continue to do very well there.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Okay, got it. Let's switch it back to the developed markets. And I guess, can you talk
about the changes you made in response to the ruling from the EC and the impact
that would have to your business? It's an open-ended question but...FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-28

Yes. So we're obviously working closely with EC to trying and ﬁnd a remedy to the
situation. I think we found a solution here. And the solution basically says that we
have to put our own shopping services on equal terms with the -- what we call CSS,
comparison shopping services. And yes, I think we have a solution here. It's
important, I think, to remember that we deﬁne ourselves as an open platform in that
sector and that we are really trying to connect retail partners to consumers. And we
will continue to do this. And the case was brought forward by the comparison
shopping services, not by the retail partners who are actually very happy working
with us in that environment. So I think we have found a solution here.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Okay, understood. I mean, for me personally, I don't know if you need to really
answer this question. But for me personally, I think having another intermediary in
there that sits in between the advertisers and the consumer, it just makes no sense to
me. But you don't have to answer that question.
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Yes, I don't want to comment on that one. We always look at it from a consumer
experience, right? So we are trying to create great consumer experiences for them,
especially on, as I said before, smaller-screen devices. Remember, the smaller your
screen, or maybe even as a voice answer at one point, right, the higher the quality,
the higher the expectation level from the consumer in terms of quality is. So we --
that's what we're really focused on. Whoever can provide that the best, we're trying
to basically supply that as an answer.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yes, understood. Let's bring it home. In the U.S., I mean, there's sort of another sort
of regulatory fear. And that's the threat of regular -- regulation with -- Google was
summoned to Washington, along with Facebook and Twitter to answer for, I guess,
election meddling as well as fake news issues. So what is the solution that you think
Google would like to present as this seems like a particularly diﬃcult problem that
you have to wrestle with?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
So those are quite distinct things, right? We have the advertising side on one hand
that you mentioned. You used the word election meddling. And then there's the fake
news world. I think it's really important to realize that we've had policies in place for
a very, very long time that don't allow ads that are either deceitful or misinformed.
And we have actively enforced those policies also for a very, very long time. I think in
2016, we have taken roughly 1.7 billion ads out of our -- out of the system. 1.7 billion.
That's a pretty signiﬁcant number. And on the political ad side, we have been even
stricter. We have only oﬀered very, very limited targeting options, a very clear vetting
process on our end. And we will obviously continue to work with authorities and
everyone necessary to basically avoid any potential type of election meddling, as
you mentioned. And be even better at it going forward, that's number one. On theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-28

A - Philipp Schindlerfake news side, remember, I mean, we want to provide quality access and quality
information to our users. That's who we are. And we have to deal with content forms
and spam ﬁlter, spam attacks on e-mail and (what's or not) for a very, very long time
and have quite a bit of experience in dealing with those things. So there has
deﬁnitely been a few issues on Google as well. I'm not trying to deny this. But we've
taken a lot of actions. And I think pretty swift actions. So we've changed and adjusted
our search algorithm. As we announced a while ago, we have oﬀered better ﬂagging
on products such as suggest, for example, or some of the featured snippets. We
have introduced things like Fact Check Tag, for example, on Google Search and
Google News results where we're working with outside organizations to basically
fact-check some of our information. So I think we have -- we have invested quite
heavily. And we will continue to invest quite heavily in providing nonspammy,
relevant, quality information, because that's who we are as a company. That's who we
want to be.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yes. So I presume that in order to get this kickstarted, I guess, the ﬂagging of fake
news and other story items that might not necessarily be true, is there some
opportunity to gain an eﬃciency over time? Because presumably in the beginning,
you probably have to have human spotters for some of the fake news items. And
presumably, they will train, I guess, machine learning and AI over some time frame
so they can gain some amount of eﬃciency and spot those more quickly. So is that
something that still requires some amount of human supervision? Or over the longer
term, would you be able to see some amount of eﬃciency on spotting that type of

So without mentioning -- without going speciﬁcally to the fake news piece. But in
general, the way this always works is -- always is maybe a bit exaggerated. But the
way this usually works is we obviously try to use machine learning algorithms. And
the better they get, the better we get at this. And that's why I mentioned, we have
been in this -- in the business of identifying spammy-type of approaches for a very,
very long time. And I think the latest generation of machine learning really helps
there. But it is obviously helpful in many of those cases. It's basically a circular
approach. You use basically humans to better understand some of the things that are
going on. And then you use the input from the human radars to train your machine
learning algorithms. As your machine learning algorithms go become better, it goes
to the humans again. And it becomes circular. So of course, we expect a scale eﬀect
over time coming from the quality improvements and the machine learning
algorithms there.

Got it. Switching topics again. Let's talk about ad blocking. I mean, this technology
has the potential to harm your business. It seems a little bit odd to see you
proactively proposing if you just add on the Chrome browser. So seems like a
conﬂict of interest. So how do you navigate, I guess, what it is eﬀectively a (inaudible)

A - Philipp SchindlerThat's a good question. So I think there is no doubt that apps can be amazing
consumer experiences. But there's also no doubt that some of the ads out there are
probably not of the highest quality. And that actually hurts the overall web
ecosystem, because the web ecosystem, to a very large extent, in order to supply
attractive and, in many cases, free content relies on great consumer experiences
from an ads perspective as well. So we've done very, very -- working with the
Coalition for Better Ads. I should say that Coalition for Better Ads is actually in the
lead. And we work closely with them on ﬁrst understanding what our bad ad
experiences. And this is fully based on consumer research, based on a lot of
consumer research and identiﬁed that there's certain type of ads that are speciﬁcally
bad, like full interstitials or ads automatically playing with -- like instantly interrupting
with sound on or ﬂashy ads. Those type of experiences where users are very, very
negative against, 100% research-based. And now take a look at our consumer
products, which is Chrome in this case. Chrome has, for a long time, tried to provide
an incredible web browsing experience and has oﬀered things like pop-up blockers
for a very, very long time. So bringing those things together, you can actually see
that it makes sense. And we've announced that somewhere early in 2018, we're
thinking about actually taking the Better Ads Standard, which was developed by the
coalition, to an integration into Google Chrome. If this gives for an overall healthier,
better consumer experience, I personally think everybody will beneﬁt from that.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Okay. And how are the conversations with the publishers? Because I mean,
presumably, most of them are probably playing within the guardrails but there are
probably some that might not be playing in within the guardrails and some where
their revenue was bound to be aﬀected as well?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
So long term, it doesn't make sense for publishers to oﬀer really bad advertising
experiences because you will have 2 eﬀects: number one is either your ad blocker
rate goes up or your time spent on site will go down, right? And both of those are,
over time, not sustainable for a publisher. Then that's why I think -- that's why I talked
about the ecosystem and the fact that's actually good for the overall ecosystem,
high-quality ads are the way forward.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Okay, understood. We have an open-ended question. But you talked about the
diﬀerent ways that machine learning is aﬀecting the ad product, I guess, both to the
ad agencies. And you mentioned SMBs earlier as well. I mean, there's been a bunch
of new products to help them deploy money online as well. I mean, for advertisers,
that might not be as sophisticated. I think automated bidding was a product. And I
think within YouTube, there's, I think, creative tool that allows you to have multiple
creatives so you can target more eﬀectively. So can you talk about all the diﬀerent
ways that you're trying to take? Because using machine learning to take friction out
for the advertiser...

A - Philipp SchindlerYes. I mean, yes, we're really using machine learning everywhere now and on the
advertising side and again, in many, many places. I mean, you can go through a lot
of diﬀerent areas, take a look at the whole world of audiences and targeting a
product like Universal App Campaigns, where you see a -- which has very, very
successful. The core of the whole product and identifying new audiences is based on
machine learning algorithms. You take a look at the creative world, you brieﬂy
mentioned it. I think we just announced a couple of months ago a product called
Director Mix for YouTube that helps you basically auto-create video creatives. There's
a whole bunch -- a bunch of diﬀerent variations. I mean, that would be impossible in
a non-machine learning-based world at the scale and at the quality, by the way, in
which we can oﬀer this now. Go down the whole world of bidding. You mentioned
smart bidding, improvement of bidding algorithms. The right bit at the right time
exactly in the millisecond where it makes sense. Our smart bidding products are
extremely successful. And we can see advertisers, whether small advertisers or large
advertisers, at a signiﬁcant rate actually moving towards those, all based on very
sophisticated machine learning in the background. Take a look at the whole world of
measurement, for example, some of our latest attribution products are giving you a
much more holistic view of attribution versus just the traditional last click attribution
path. All very, very much machine learning-based. So we literally deploy machine
learning across our advertising systems at the moment, always with the intent to
actually create a better ROI for our advertisers, our partners, our SMBs and so on.
And we're actually very happy with some of the results there.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Great. All right. So I think with that, we are out of time. And thanks very much, Phil,
for joining us.

Thank you. Thank you. So much. Thank you, to all of you. Thank you.
