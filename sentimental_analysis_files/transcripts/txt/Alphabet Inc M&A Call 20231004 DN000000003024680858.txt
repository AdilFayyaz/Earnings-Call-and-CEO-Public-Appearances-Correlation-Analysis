Hello. Thanks for joining us, whether you're streaming the show from around the
world or live with us here in Pier 57 in New York City. Extra special welcome to our
friends in Japan and across Asia who are staying up late with us today.
2023 is a big year for Google. If you've been following the company, you know we
celebrated our 25th birthday last month. And it's a year of massive innovation. We're
sharing AI breakthroughs and new research on a weekly basis. Now, I've worked in
the tech industry for a long time, and I've never seen anything like the speed of
innovation at Google right now. In the ﬁve months since Google I/O, we've rolled out
new capabilities across so many Google products, including Search, Workspace,
Android, and Bard. As always, our focus is on making AI more helpful for everyone,
in a way that's both bold and responsible.
Now, today we're going to talk about what that means for Pixel, the only phone
engineered by Google. We have so much to share with you. Now, looking around
the room here, I see a few people who were here at our ﬁrst Pixel launch seven years
ago. And if you can remember, we shared our vision for mobile computing, that the
world was evolving from mobile-ﬁrst to AI ﬁrst. And we explained that Pixel is
designed to bring hardware and software together with AI at the center to deliver
simple, fast, and smart experiences.
Now, since then, Pixel's had so many breakthrough features and technological ﬁrsts.
What I'm most proud of is how consistently we've tracked to that early vision of Pixel
as the AI-centric mobile computer. We're still at it, and people are taking notice. PixelFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-04

Page 2 of 15is the fastest-growing smartphone brand in our top markets and the only one that
grew in units sold year-over-year. Across Google's entire line of Pixel phones, we're
taking the approach that advanced hardware needs amazing software and state-of-
the-art AI to reach its full potential.
Now at the same time, cutting-edge software and AI models only come to life with
the help of advanced hardware. It all has to work closely together, and you can see
that approach across Google. We have custom-designed data centers with Google's
own Tensor processing units so they can run the latest AI models from Google
DeepMind. And it's true of Pixel phones, which pair custom Google Silicon with
advanced software and personal AI for a completely unique smartphone experience.
Now, it's even true of Pixel Camera, which uses Google AI models to go way beyond
taking a good photo. Pixel Camera makes it easy to get beautiful shots in nearly
impossible lighting conditions, track moving subjects, and get colors and skin tones
just right. The computational photography in Pixel Camera is one of the biggest
mobile computing breakthroughs of the last decade, and it's moved the entire
industry forward. The idea of AI-centric mobile computing was a radical concept
when Pixel ﬁrst launched. But Pixel's demonstrated again and again that it's the
clearest path to helpful, simple, personal smartphone experiences.
Over the past few years, we've applied our experience with AI in phones to a
growing Pixel portfolio of devices, like watches, tablets, foldables, and buds. And as
Google AI gets better, those devices keep getting better, too. For instance, this week,
we're rolling out our biggest update ever to Pixel Buds Pro, with a number of AI-
enabled features and improvements. We're improving our Clear Calling technology,
which automatically reduces background noise and enhances the voices on any
phone call you receive. It doesn't matter if the person is calling you from a busy
sidewalk or in a noisy restaurant, you'll hear them even more clearly. And it works on
every call. No need to press a button and turn it on each time.
Pixel Buds Pro are also among the ﬁrst earbuds to use Bluetooth super-wideband
speech. It doubles the bandwidth to make voices sound more natural. And when it's
combined with Clear Calling, your phone calls sound so much better. Just listen to
the before and after.
(Video Presentation)
You can really hear the diﬀerence.
Now, AI can make Pixel Buds Pro more convenient to use as well. When you're
listening to music and need to have a quick chat with a coworker or tell the barista
your coﬀee order, you can just start talking. Pixel Buds Pro will automatically pause
your audio and turn on transparency mode. No more scrambling to pull the phone
out of your pocket or take out an earbud. Now we're also reducing latency by up to
50%, which is great news for the gamers out there. And there are a few more
updates today that you can read about over on the Google Store.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-04
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 3 of 15James ParkPixel Buds Pro aren't the only devices getting a boost today. With our new feature
drop rolling out today, we're bringing dual-screen interpreter mode to Pixel Fold.
You and whoever you're talking to can now have your own personal translator across
more than 45 languages. And along with device updates, we're also tapping
Google's AI research to create richer user experiences in our apps and services. For
instance, we see so many opportunities to bring AI into Google Home to make your
smart home more intuitive and helpful. It can be hard to keep track of what's going
on at home. If you're on vacation or just having a busy week, catching up can involve
a lot of scrolling. But generative AI can help with that by synthesizing all that info into
a more simple view. In the Google Home app, you'll soon get a streamlined view of
what happened recently with a quick and easy summary.
If you're wondering about your packages, you'll be able to ask about your home in
natural language and quickly ﬁnd the clip you're looking for from your Nest Doorbell
video history. And it'll be easy to take action on those insights, too. Just type a
follow-up query, and the Home app will be able to generate a suggested automation
for your devices. And we'll be rolling out these experimental features to subscribers
next year, and we've got a whole lot more of where that came from.
Today, we're going to show you the next evolution of Pixel wearables and phones
that pull together premium hardware, the most helpful software and services from
Google, and the very latest state-of-the-art AI research. It's an action-packed show, so
let's get into it.
Here's James to show you the next generation of Pixel wearables.
{BIO 16240902 <GO>}
Hey, everyone. Last year's Pixel Watch was the ﬁrst device to combine the best of
Google's helpfulness with the health and ﬁtness expertise of Fitbit. And that was only
the beginning. I'd like to introduce you to Google Pixel Watch 2. It's completely
upgraded inside and out, including major performance improvements. And you're
getting Google and Fitbit experiences you won't ﬁnd on any other smartwatch, with
the best of Fitbit health and ﬁtness tracking. We've upgraded the design and
materials as well. People love the sleek water droplet look of the ﬁrst Pixel Watch.
We're upgrading our low-proﬁle design for Pixel Watch 2 with more durable cover
glass and 100% recycled aluminum housing that's lighter and more comfortable to
wear when you're at play and at rest.
And we took the same care with our new bands and watch faces. Elegant metals are
designed to impress. Our new sport design is more breathable. And Pixel Watch 2
uses the same simple band mechanism, so last year's Pixel Watch bands still work
great. And you'll see big upgrades across the entire Pixel Watch 2 experience. The
new quad-core CPU gives you smooth, snappy performance. And battery life has
improved as well. Even with the display in always-on mode, you'll get 24 hours of use
on a single charge. And it charges faster, too, with a 12-hour charge in just 30
minutes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-04
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 15You're also getting the full Wear OS 4 experience with new apps like Gmail and
Calendar, improvements to YouTube Music, Maps, and Google Assistant, and more
of the third-party apps you know and love. With helpful apps and an all-day battery,
Pixel Watch 2 is a great companion on any adventure. And if you get into a bind, you
now have Pixel's safety features like medical information and emergency sharing
right on your watch.
We're also bringing Safety Check over from our Pixel phones to make sure you don't
feel alone on the trail or on your walk home. Just set a timer for when you expect to
arrive back home. If you can't check in after it expires, Safety Check will share your
location with your emergency contacts. And by the way, with Fitbit Premium, you can
use safety features like Safety Check and emergency location sharing even if you
haven't connected your LT-enabled Pixel Watch 2 to a network.
Now, I started Fitbit 16 years ago on the idea that a new generation of wearable
sensors could help people live healthier lives. And it's a mission we're still on as a
combined Fitbit and Google team. With Pixel Watch 2, we're bringing together new
AI algorithms, upgraded software, and three new sensors to give you the most
complete picture of your everyday health. Pixel Watch's heart rate sensor has been
upgraded from a single-path sensor to a brand-new, fully-redesigned, multi-path
sensor. We've 10x-ed the number of optical channels that can measure heart rate
compared to the ﬁrst-gen Pixel Watch. So now your heart rate can be measured in
multiple locations on your wrist for a more accurate reading. And combined with an
improved ML algorithm, Pixel Watch 2 produces up to 40% more accurate heart rate
tracking during vigorous activities like HIIT, spinning, and rowing.
And to further enhance your workout, new coaching features keep you on pace and
in your target heart rate zone, while the more glanceable UI helps you nail your
intervals. The new skin temperature sensor delivers better insights into your sleep
and overall wellness. And the new continuous electrodermal activity sensor, or cEDA
sensor, powers Fitbit's body response. It detects moments when you're physically
showing signs of stress, oﬀers interventions to de-stress, and then afterwards
prompts reﬂection over your day and week to help you better manage your stress in
the future.
Let's get a closer look at how the best of Fitbit and the best of Google come
together in Pixel Watch 2.
(Video Presentation)
Amazing. It's always inspiring to hear a story like Shauna's. Now, most of us aren't
Olympic climber parents, but all of us could beneﬁt from a more complete picture of
our health and wellness. And that's reﬂected in the newly redesigned Fitbit app,
which launched last month. The new app gives you a holistic view of your health and
wellness with a focus on the metrics that matter most to you. You'll see a new
structure with three tabs in the streamlined UI. The Today tab keeps you on track with
your stats and goals. The Coach tab oﬀers an easy way to browse and ﬁlter workoutsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-04
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 15Rick Osterlohand mindfulness sessions. The You tab helps you manage your personal details,
goals, achievements, and connections with friends and family.
And looking ahead, we see so many possibilities to use AI to bring you personalized
coaching, dynamic workout recommendations, and even more context and insight.
For example, the Fitbit app can use generative AI to surface connections and
correlations in your Fitbit data. There's times when I think, hey, today's run felt harder
than usual. How does it compare with my previous runs? Is there something in my
overall data that could explain it? Fitbit answers my question by analyzing the most
relevant data. In this case, my latest run was a 5K. So Fitbit surfaces and compares it
to all my recent runs with similar distance. Fitbit conﬁrms my pace was a bit slower
and oﬀers up insights into why today's run felt harder than usual. And it turns out the
route I took was a bit hillier than normal. It also points out a recent downward trend
in my sleep scores and how combined with hills, that might have had an impact on
my perceived exertion. Then, on the spot, Fitbit generates a chart speciﬁcally for my
question with my latest pace compared with similar runs, providing a dynamic view
of my ﬁtness data that previously wasn't available.
With generative AI on your side, you'll have so many creative ways to dig into your
health and ﬁtness data. And you'll get some validation on days when those hill runs
just feel harder than usual. We'll be rolling out this capability early next year to
trusted testers in the Fitbit app as part of the new Fitbit Labs program with priority
access for Pixel phone owners. And keep an eye out for more AI-powered Fitbit Labs
experiences to follow.
With new sensors, longer battery life, new features like body response, updated
watch faces and bands, and the updated Fitbit app, Pixel Watch 2 delivers a
completely upgraded smartwatch experience. And we can't wait for you to try it on.
Pixel Watch 2 comes in a Wi-Fi and an LTE version. You can pre-order starting today,
and they'll ship next week. Every Pixel Watch 2 also comes with six months of Fitbit
Premium, which unlocks a whole new level of insights and content to help inform
your wellness journey. And for the ﬁtness tracker fans out there, check out the just-
released Fitbit Charge 6. It delivers the most accurate heart rate we've ever released
on a tracker. And it's the ﬁrst tracker to include Google Essentials like Maps, Wallet,
and YouTube Music Controls.
Next up, here's Rick again to introduce the next evolution of Pixel smartphones.
{BIO 15100996 <GO>}
Pixel has been the ﬁrst phone to deliver so many innovations, thanks to the tight
integration with Google's AI research. The ﬁrst phone to truly see in the dark. The
ﬁrst phone to answer the phone for you. The ﬁrst phone to unblur your photos. The
ﬁrst phone with car crash detection. The ﬁrst phone to protect your browsing with a
built-in VPN at no extra cost. And we have a whole new set of ﬁrsts to show you
today.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-04
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 15Claude ZellwegerI'm excited to introduce you to the next evolution of AI in your hand, Google Pixel 8
Pro and Google Pixel 8. Our latest phones bring together so many technologies from
across Google. They're the ﬁrst phones to use our latest Google Tensor chip. They
include the very best Android experience, ﬁrst-of-their-kind camera experiences, and
the latest AI advancements from Google. From the inside out, Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro
are built to deliver the help you need in a way that only Google can. And as you can
see, they're absolutely stunning.
Here's Claude to take you through all the gorgeous design details.
Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are the most beautiful phones we've ever made. They're the
centerpiece of Google's growing Pixel portfolio. And you can see how well they're
complemented by the rest of the family. Every Pixel device, from the phone in your
hands, to the watch on your wrist, to the buds in your ear, and to the tablet in your
home, is designed to ﬁt into your life seamlessly to provide a helpful, ﬂuid
experience and to reﬂect the human, optimistic, and daring design that Pixel is
known for.
Instead of angular corners and edges, Pixel devices replicates that calming feeling of
picking up a smooth piece of sea glass. Pixel 8 is an evolution of the iconic Pixel
design with more ﬂuid contours and a smaller size that feels so natural to hold. Pixel
8 Pro introduces new, considered design elements into the portfolio. We're using a
soft, silky, matte glass ﬁnish to contrast with the high-polished camera bar and
highlight our powerful new camera system. We bring that same thoughtfulness to
Pixel's color palette, which continues to evolve with natural and inviting views. Our
porcelain shade on Pixel 8 Pro is accented by a soft gold trim for a luxurious ceramic
look. And our new bay blue color is both energetic and hopeful. We're even
updating Pixel Buds Pro today with new colors to go with our new phones, including
bay blue and porcelain.
As a company, we know that device manufacturing carries a heavy responsibility, and
we take that responsibility seriously. We continue to design all of our products with
sustainability in mind from the very beginning. We're working towards Google's
commitment of net zero emissions by 2030 by reimagining the materials that go into
our products, how we manufacture them, and how we distribute them. And that's
why we're now on our fourth generation of Pixel phones that use recycled aluminum.
In fact, every device you see today uses repurposed materials, from the 100%
recycled aluminum enclosures on Pixel phones to our fabric watch bands. And Pixel
8 packaging is completely free of plastic.
Another aspect of sustainability is longevity. Accidents happen, and we're working to
make Pixel phones easier to repair. We've partnered with iFixit to oﬀer parts, tools,
and repair guides directly to DIYers so that it's easier than ever to repair your own
display, your battery, or your camera.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-04
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 15Monika GuptaNow, one of the most important design elements on Pixel 8's design is the surface
that you look at the most, the display. Your phone should show you the world in the
way that it actually appears in real life. So we've been working on a new display
oﬀering, which we're calling the Actua display. You'll see it for the ﬁrst time on Pixel
8. The 6.2-inch Actua display on Pixel 8 is 42% brighter than on Pixel 7 and gives you
ultra real-world clarity for your videos, for your games, your photos, and everything
else that you do on your phone. And Pixel 8 Pro takes our real-world display
technology to the next level with our new Super Actua display. The 6.7-inch display is
even more immersive, and it's our brightest display yet with a stunning peak
brightness of 2400 nits and a variable refresh rate that intelligently adjusts from 1 to
120 hertz. Even in direct sunlight, you'll love how true-to-life your ultra-HDR images
look.
On the back of Pixel 8 Pro, you can see that we've added a new temperature sensor.
It's a convenient and a quick way to check the temp on a pan or to make sure that
the milk in your baby's bottle is just the right temperature. We've submitted an
application to the FDA so that you can also use our thermometer app to take your
own temperature, which can be saved to the Fitbit app in the future.
Along with beautiful updates to the body, the display, the ﬁnishes, materials, and
colors, Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are getting some big upgrades on the inside. Here's
Monika to tell us about the next generation of Google Tensor.
{BIO 7403382 <GO>}
Pixel 8's helpful AI experiences start right in the silicon. Let me introduce you to the
new Google Tensor G3. It's our latest mobile SoC designed speciﬁcally to bring
Google's AI breakthroughs directly to Pixel users and show the world what's
possible. In our new Tensor G3 chip, every major subsystem has been upgraded. It
includes the latest generation of ARM CPUs, an upgraded GPU, new ISP and imaging
DSP, and of course, the TPU, our on-device AI engine that we've custom-designed to
run Google's AI models eﬃciently.
I want to show you what those models look like at an on-device level and how Tensor
continues to push the boundaries when it comes to AI innovation in mobile
computing. Let's start with the growth of machine learning models in Pixel.
Compared to the ﬁrst generation of Tensor on Pixel 6, the new Pixel 8 runs more than
twice as many machine learning models on device. That's a massive jump in a short
time. And it means Pixel's machine learning isn't just for speech and photos
anymore. ML models now enhance just about every aspect of Pixel's user
experience. And the models themselves are getting more sophisticated too. The
heaviest model in Pixel 8 is 10 times more complex compared to Pixel 6. Tensor G3 is
so eﬃcient, not only does it run more ML models, more complex models, but in
many cases, it runs them concurrently which is why Pixel can deliver so many
unbelievably helpful experiences that no other phone can like amazing new Pixel
Camera capabilities, which you'll see in just a bit.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-04
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 8 of 15Shenaz ZackBut ﬁrst, let's talk about Pixel 8's new speech enhancements. Pixel speech and
natural language understanding continue to lead the industry with on-device
accuracy that rivals the machine learning in our data centers. You can already use
Pixel to type, edit, and send messages with your voice. Now Pixel 8 even knows what
language you're speaking and can switch back and forth with you as you talk in
multiple languages. No other phone lets you do that. Pixel 8 is also our ﬁrst phone to
use the same text-to-speech model that Google uses in our data centers. So I can
just long press on the power button and Pixel 8 will read web pages out loud for me.
This is super useful when I want to listen to articles while walking my dog, Berkeley.
[ph] Let's take a listen.
(Video Presentation)
The voice sounds more natural and I can fast forward or modify the speed. I can even
ask my Pixel to read the pages in a diﬀerent language. And Google's speech models
are also behind Pixel Call Assist, a suite of features that just make your phone calls
and life easier like helping you navigate a phone tree and automatically removing
background noise from your calls with clear calling and saving you from calls you
don't want with call screen. Now with improved AI, the next generation of call screen
is helping Pixel users receive 50% fewer spam calls on average. It silently answers
calls from unknown numbers with a new, more natural speaking voice. And it's smart
enough to separate the calls you really want from the calls you really don't. Here's
what's happening behind the screens.
(Video Presentation)
You can see why Pixel users love this feature. But some calls about travel are actually
important.
(Video Presentation)
And then there are calls that require just a moment of your attention. Call screen will
soon oﬀer contextual replies so you can respond in a tap without even taking the
call. No more playing phone tag with your doctor's oﬃce just to conﬁrm an
appointment. This next generation of auto-call screen will even work on Pixel Watch
when connected to a Tensor-enabled Pixel phone. It'll come to Pixel Watch and Pixel
Watch 2 in a feature drop later this year.
Those are just a few improvements coming to Pixel 8 with Tensor G3. And with each
new generation of Tensor, we're pushing the boundaries of on-device AI and
redeﬁning state-of-the-art for mobile computing. You'll see big jumps across
practically every major user experience on Pixel 8, including the camera.
And here's Shenaz to take us through all the ﬁrsts coming to the fully upgraded Pixel
8 Camera.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-04
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 15We have so much exciting new camera magic to share with you today, upgraded
hardware, breakthrough features, new ways to work with motion and sound, and
completely new image capabilities. The incredible Pixel 8 Camera combines
powerful AI and Tensor G3 with the fully upgraded ultrawide and a new wide camera
that's capable of producing 2X optical quality images, with even better low-light
performance. And the biggest leap forward in Pixel Camera this year is video. The
video capabilities in Pixel 8 represent years of R&D across Tensor, AI, and software.
Combine that work with the upgraded main sensor and you'll see vast
improvements in low-light video performance, dynamic range, and shadow noise.
And we're continuing to expand our image equity eﬀorts with Real Tone, so your
videos and photos accurately portray the wide range of human skin tones. Along
with Pixel's best-ever skin tone accuracy in your videos, you'll see improved mixed
lighting performance and much faster autofocus in low-light. So no matter what
you're creating with Pixel Camera, everyone will look more like their beautiful selves.
Now, as every creator knows, visuals are only half of the equation when it comes to
great video clips. So we are pioneering new computational audio capabilities with
the ﬁrst-of-its-kind feature called Audio Magic Eraser. It lets you reduce distracting
sounds in your videos using Tensor G3 and advanced machine learning models, and
it's easy enough that anybody can do it. Audio Magic Eraser identiﬁes diﬀerent
sounds in your video and sorts them into distinct layers that you can control.
So now, with a few taps, your baby's video sounds just the way you want. Alongside
breakthrough video capabilities, Pixel 8 introduces a whole set of new features that
make it easier than ever to get great photos, even in the trickiest conditions. Like
when you're trying to take the group photo over and over and over again, only to
ﬁnd somebody is always blinking or rolling their eyes. Group photos are tough, but
Pixel gives you the option to make them easier with the new Best Take feature in
Google Photos. Best Take uses a series of photos taken closer together to help you
create the shot you want. So you can choose what you think is the best expression
for everyone in the photo.
Let's take a look.
(Video Presentation)
Best Take lets you use the photos you did take to get the photo you thought you
took. Of course, sometimes you might want to use your imagination to create
something new. As we announced at I/O, Magic Editor in Google Photos lets you use
generative AI to reimagine your photos. Just tap or circle the object you want to edit,
drag to reposition your subject, pinch to resize them, or use one-tap presets to make
the background pop. It's an intuitive new way to edit so you are in control of your
images, whether you want to better capture the moment or add your own creative
touch.
Pixel Camera continues to get more accessible too, to help people with vision
impairment get the perfect photo. Guided frame now works both on the front andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-04

and even documents. Pixel 8 re-imagines what you can do with a smartphone
camera. With Best Take, Generative AI in Magic Editor, best-in-class video and Audio
Magic Eraser. That's a whole lot of ﬁrsts and new ways to get creative with your
videos and images. Take a look.
(Video Presentation)
Pixel 8's camera is truly magical. But you know, some people won't be satisﬁed with
anything but our absolute best camera in a smartphone. And you'll get it with Pixel 8
Pro, which has everything you just saw in Pixel 8 and much more for people who
want the most powerful camera system. Every camera in Pixel 8 Pro is upgraded. The
triple rear pro camera system gets a new main sensor with better low-light
performance, a bigger ultra-wide lens with even better macro focus, an upgraded
telephoto that can capture 56% more light and take photos with 10x optical quality,
and we've added autofocus on the front-facing camera so you can take the best
pixel selﬁes ever.
Now, when you combine the upgraded hardware and advanced Google AI, it makes
it easy for everyone to get a picture-perfect Pixel photo in any lighting condition.
We're also introducing new pro controls on Pixel 8 Pro for photographers who want
total creative control over the camera. You can adjust settings like ISO sensitivity,
shutter speed, lens selection, and focus. You can also get high-resolution 50-
megapixel images from across the zoom range in both JPEG and RAW. And when
you open those RAW images in Adobe Lightroom, you'll see they retain our
signature HDR+ adjustments. We gave our Pixel Creator Lab photographers early
access to pro controls, and you can see the range of possibilities, like gorgeous
studio photography, dreamy landscapes, and full control over long exposures. If you
know your way around a camera or want to experiment and learn, pro control
unlocks a truly pro-level camera experience.
Pixel 8 Pro's combination of upgraded cameras, Tensor G3, and computational audio
means your videos will be sharper, more vibrant, and sound better than ever. Video
from Pixel 8 Pro is gorgeous. It's the best video quality ever on a Pixel, but we are
going even further to show what's possible with computational audio, introducing a
new form of video processing called Video Boost. It totally changes the game. Look
at how it compares to a diﬀerent phone we picked up recently. You can see the skin
tone is lifelike and properly balanced, while the mountains and skies have full
dynamic range. The video has vivid color and detail that pixel photos are known for.
And that's because every frame of this 4K video has gone through our HDR+ image
pipeline. For a one-minute video at 30 frames per second, that's the same as
processing 1,800 photos. Video Boost makes it possible by pairing the incredible
camera hardware and the Tensor in your Pixel with our powerful data centers.
Sounds diﬃcult, but it couldn't be simpler for you. Record a Pixel 8 Pro video with
Video Boost enabled and you'll have a high-quality version of it right away.
Meanwhile, your video uploads to the cloud where Google's computational
photography models like HDR+ are applied to your entire video, every single frame.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-04

Page 11 of 15Sissie HsiaoAnd when it's ready, the boosted video automatically appears in your Google Photos
library. And when you use Video Boost in low light, it automatically enables Night
Sight video for the ﬁrst time on Pixel. Check out what one of our favorite
photographers was able to do with Night Sight video.
(Video Presentation)
Looks stunning, right? By subtly enhancing the light in the scene, you're getting truer
colors, more details in the buildings, clearer dynamic range in the colorful lights that
make up the cityscape. Even the ﬁne details in those small alleyways, it looks like a
city at night. With Video Boost on Pixel 8 Pro, you're getting the best low-light video
of any smartphone. Video Boost is coming to Pixel 8 Pro in a feature drop in
December, and you're going to love it. It perfectly demonstrates what sets Pixel
really apart as a smartphone. You have powerful on-device processing with Tensor
G3 coming together with Google's state-of-the-art research in machine learning and
AI. And then the processing in your video is augmented by one of the world's most
powerful cloud computers. It's a unique combined approach, but the data center
acts as a virtual component of your Pixel. And it makes seemingly impossible tasks
possible in a way that only Google can.
And Video Boost isn't the only feature that draws on Google's cutting-edge data
center models. We've got some big changes coming to Google Assistant, thanks to
our advances in generative AI. And here's Sissie to give you a ﬁrst look.
{BIO 23340509 <GO>}
Seven years ago, we introduced Google Assistant on the ﬁrst Pixel phone. And since
then we have helped hundreds of millions of users across all diﬀerent devices get
things done at home and on the go. Today, I want to show you how Google is
changing how we deliver helpful experiences to people all over the world. And the
key here is our generative AI research. Bringing the latest models to this mobile
device that's always with you opens up so many new possibilities.
Just a few months ago, we launched Bard as an early experiment. It's a
conversational AI tool that lets you collaborate directly with our most capable
models. Bard can help you brainstorm ideas for a game night with friends, get some
creative inspiration for a new project at work, pick up a few tips for home repairs, or
learn a new skill. Since Bard's launch, we've been learning and iterating super fast to
make sure Bard is helpful and accessible to people everywhere. In fact, people are
using it in over 40 languages across over 220 countries and territories.
We just recently launched new extensions that make it possible for Bard to
collaborate with apps like YouTube and Maps and even your own content from Docs
and Gmail. You can ﬁnd, summarize, and answer questions across your personal
content all in one place. Bard's language understanding, complex reasoning, and
generative capabilities have fueled our excitement in realizing our vision for Google

technology to deliver it didn't exist until now.
Today, I'm excited to share an early peek at something we've been working on. We
call it Assistant with Bard, and it brings the best of both experiences right to your
phone. It's a step towards our vision to deliver the world's most helpful personal
assistant. Assistant with Bard combines personalized help with reasoning and
generative capabilities, so it can hear, it can speak, it can see, and it can even take
actions that help you out right on the device you always have with you. This is an
experiment we're super excited about.
Let me show you some examples of what it'll be able to do. A great assistant should
help you make sense of your day and stay on top of what's important. Open
Assistant with Bard and say, catch me up on any important emails I missed this week,
and you'll get a rundown of what's in your inbox. Three important emails, including a
party invite. Assistant with Bard can dig into the details for you. Where is Grayson's
party? It can spot that the party is across the river in Brooklyn. How long will it take to
get there? And just like that, you have quick directions from Google Maps. And of
course, you can still use the classic Assistant features. Text Jenny, do you want to ride
with me to Grayson's party? You can see how Assistant with Bard pulls together the
information you need from diﬀerent apps and services so you can get stuﬀ done so
much faster.
So, say, you're renting a house in Los Angeles with some friends for the weekend.
Check out how speciﬁc you can be. Make me a grocery list for the weekend for 10
people. Go heavy on the snacks, and we'll probably want a smoothie, so recommend
and include ingredients for that. Now just imagine how much time it would take to
make this on your own. And with a quick tap, you can move it into a dock and share
with your friends so you can coordinate. It took less than a minute to create. From
here, you can ask for recommendations on things to see, build a weekend itinerary,
discover the best spots to soak in the views, and anything else you need to make
planning and prep a breeze.
Now say you all decide to go on a hike with your dog, but you reach a fork in the
trail. Flip a coin? Nope. Simply snap a photo of the trail marker and ask what path do
you recommend for a group and my small dog? And just like that, you know that the
North Trail is the best one for your dog's little legs. But ﬁrst, you should snap a photo
of Baxter. The perfect photo needs the perfect caption. An assistant with BARD can
be your creative partner here. So check this out. You can pop it over your photo and
use it as the visual cue. So Assistant with Bard can see what's on your screen,
understand the context, and help you with what you need. Create a cute social
caption for Baxter. Quick and easy and you're back to enjoying your hike.
This conversational overlay is a completely new way to interact with your phone and
lets Assistant with BARD meet you wherever you are. We're so excited about what's
possible when we bring our most helpful generative AI capabilities to one of the
most assistive experiences in the world. Assistant with Bard is the coordinator who

how you get things done and bring your ideas to life like a true assistant. We're
rolling out Assistant with Bard to select testers shortly and we'll be expanding
availability as an opt-in experience in the next few months. So for Pixel 8 users keep
an eye out for how to try it for yourself.
And now back to Rick for a few ﬁnal Pixel highlights.
{BIO 15100996 <GO>}
You've heard about a lot of incredible experiences and transformational new
technologies we're bringing to Pixel, thanks to Google's deep investments in AI. And
this is just the beginning. Google's AI research teams are changing everything in this
space with generative AI foundation models. It's a paradigm shift for computing and
it leads to more contextual, more personalized, and more powerful help. For
instance, Proofread and Gboard now takes advantage of generative large language
models in the cloud so it can go way beyond ﬁxing typos. It oﬀers help with your
spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors in a single tap.
As another example, Pixel's getting better at understanding the language and
content like web pages. Here's a long article about things to do around Pier 57. Just
tap Summarize and your pixel will generate a quick overview for you. Google's
generative AI models can help you do more even on your busiest days. Now,
imagine a future where generative AI runs right on the phones we have with us
throughout the day. Pixel could be even more personalized, responsive, and always
ready to help.
So here's the news. We engineered Pixel 8 Pro to be the ﬁrst phone to run Google's
foundation models directly on the device. We've worked closely with our research
teams across Google to take advantage of their most advanced foundation models
and distill them into a version eﬃcient enough to run on our ﬂagship pixel. And even
those distilled on-device generative AI models are really complex. Pixel 8 Pro can run
generative AI with up to 150 times more computations than the largest ML model on
Pixel 7. And this leads directly to improved experiences on Pixel 8 Pro, like a better
Magic Eraser which is super useful for removing distractions from your images.
With on-device generative AI, you can now remove larger objects and people
without smudging your photo. Instead of blending the surrounding pixels, the
improved Magic Eraser generates completely new pixels to ﬁll in the spaces left
behind by cars, people, or anything else you don't want in your shot. So you get a
higher-quality image that looks just the way you want it to.
Now you'll get the upgraded Magic Eraser right away on Pixel 8 Pro and we're
working hard on lots more generative AI features that are coming to Pixel over the
next few months. For instance, recorders getting even more helpful with on-device
summarizations. Recorder is already an incredible way to capture and make sense of
audio with accurate live transcriptions and powerful search running right on the
phone.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-04

Page 14 of 15With on-device generative AI and Pixel 8 Pro, you'll be able to get concise
summaries of your recordings that quickly recap the highlights from a recorded
meeting or presentation. In the coming months, Pixel 8 Pro's on-device LLM will also
power smart replies in Gboard. You'll see better conversational awareness so it can
generate higher quality reply suggestions. And along with speech and language,
Pixel has always pushed the boundaries of what's possible with imaging.
In a major breakthrough for mobile computing, Pixel 8 Pro will be the ﬁrst
smartphone to have a custom generative AI image model on-device. Our newest
feature building on this will be Zoom Enhance. When you pinch in, Zoom Enhance
can intelligently sharpen and enhance the details of your images so you can get
closer than ever, even when you forget to zoom. It's an incredible application of
generative AI, opening up a range of possibilities for framing and editing your
images. So the kind of zoom enhancement you used to see in science ﬁction, it's
right in the phone in your hand.
So these are just a few of the early applications of on-device foundation models we
can run on Tensor G3. And they aren't often some far distant future. Pixel 8 Pro ships
with the updated Magic Eraser and the others will be available in our upcoming
feature drops starting in December. And for years to come, your Pixel 8 Pro will bring
you the latest on-device generative AI innovation from Google as we roll out new
features. We're so excited about the future of the Pixel portfolio.
Thanks for letting us share our vision with you today. You'll ﬁnd all these new
products available for pre-order right now in the Google Store. Pixel 8 comes with an
unbelievable camera for both photos and videos, a brilliant Actua display, the
powerful new Tensor G3 chip for helpful features like Best Take and the new call
screen. And Pixel 8 is available for pre-order today with some great oﬀers. It comes
in three colors and it's on shelves next week.
Pixel 8 Pro is a true ﬂagship phone with never-before-seen features and design
elements. You're getting Super Actua, the best Pixel display ever, upgraded
performance, enhanced connectivity, faster charging speeds. It's the ﬁrst Pixel with a
temperature sensor. You get a massive upgrade in camera sensors and lenses, pro
controls for experienced photographers, industry-leading video, thanks to Video
Boost. And it's the ﬁrst phone engineered and built for the generative AI era with
new breakthrough AI features coming later this year and so many more in the future.
Pixel 8 Pro is available for pre-order now in a fresh range of colors and it'll be on
shelves with Pixel 8 next week.
Pixel 8 and 8 Pro are also the ﬁrst phones to ship with Android 14, bringing exciting
new capabilities like generative AI wallpapers, more customizable lock screens,
monochrome theming, ultra HDR, and more. It's such an exciting time for the Pixel
family. Our vision of AI-centric mobile computing has guided us for the past seven
years. And as I say every year, it feels like we're just getting started. We're hoping
your Pixel 8 is just getting started too and that it'll be with you through years of AI
advances and breakthroughs. And that's why for the ﬁrst time, Google is expanding
Pixel support to seven years. Seven years of OS upgrades, security updates, featureFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-04

Page 15 of 15drops, and AI innovations. That means your Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro will be supported
all the way to 2030. No major smartphone brand oﬀers this committed level of
support and longevity.
Well, that's our show for today. There's a lot more to these new products and
services. You can get all the details right now on the Google Store and we'd also
love to see you in our Google Store locations here in New York and at our newest
store at our headquarters in Mountain View which opens next week. Thanks so much
