Thanks, Chen. So the largest shopping season of the year Christmas is just around
the corner, less than 40 days to Christmas and Black Friday week begins next week.
How will the season shape out? Will shoppers shop and will retailers make their
topline estimates without jeopardizing margins? We, the Bloomberg Intelligence
consumer team see sales growth over last year levels, some margins may remain
pressured. Sales should materialize from higher consumer conﬁdence and extra
selling day between Thanksgiving and Christmas and the rise in online shopping,
retailers' optimism for sales is also evident in increased holiday hiring.
Margins still may come under pressure from rising freight costs, a warmer winter that
may prevent till this cold weather apparel, increased payroll costs and higher
promotions as retailers battle each other for market share gains. So what happened
last year in holiday? Last year holiday sales advanced 4%, according to the NRF. This
year's estimate spanned from 3.3% at the ICSC or the International Council of
Shopping Centers to 5.7% by eMarketer, NRF is at the middle at around 3.7% growth.
Much of the increase in holiday sales that we are seeing from these estimates is
expected to come from rising ecommerce sales, which eMarketer expects to grow
14% over last year.
Risks to attaining these stats or these sales forecast may include a risk of the US
government shutdown, any economic or job growth hiccup, a steeper deceleration
in tourism if the dollar continues to get stronger.
I'll turn it over to Josh to give a little insight on to the consumer outlook.
{BIO 17944409 <GO>}
Hello. Stepping back to the macro perspective, focusing on the domestic outlook,
there have been some signs of deceleration in consumer spending recently if you
look at the September personal consumption expenditures reports and the October
retail sales report. But despite that, our view is that the fundamentals of the US
consumer remain quite solid. So we're just going to go over a couple of those
factors and some of the recent trends.
The ﬁrst slide, you can see here the real consumer spending has remained above
3%, now not quite as high as what we saw in -- on average in 2014. It's still higher
than most of what we saw over the prior ﬁve years and certainly above what the ﬁve-
year average was.
Compared to what we've seen over the last couple of decades in this larger
historical perspective, this kind of growth is unspectacular but it's still quite solid and
it's not hard to identify some of the reasons why that might be gas and energy prices
have remained low, consumer balance sheets have improved greatly since the time
of the great recession with new foreclosures down sharply, mortgage delinquencies
down, home equity restored and while there are some concerns about student loans
and auto loans. Overall, the consumer appears to be in much better ﬁnancial shape.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-16
Costco Wholesale Corp (COST US Equity)
Page 3 of 11Chen GrazutisTurning to the next slide, you can see that going forward; one of the key drivers of
the consumer behavior is likely to be job growth. And here, the recent results have
been pretty encouraging. It's tempting to tribute the recent deceleration in
consumer spending to the soft patch we had in August and September job growth,
but October was certainly very reassuring to see the sharp rebound in nonfarm
payrolls. And along with jobs themselves, you can see that aggregate income has
been rising and that income is going to be what will drive the actual spending by
consumers.
The other thing that is notable about the jobs outlook is that the performance there
seems to be driving, what's going on in consumer sentiment. So although consumer
sentiment like job growth has come down a little bit from the highs [ph] seen at the
end of 2014 and early 2015, it's still quite solid. And in the latest report of University
of Michigan Survey, there were some interesting details suggesting that most of the
recent improvement after the soft patch in August and September had come from
the bottom two-thirds of the income distribution, which is interesting because that's
the portion of the population that is much more exposed to the labor market in
terms of what drives their consumption behavior relative to the top third of the
income distribution, which is more exposed to ﬁnancial markets.
So that's the fact that (inaudible) have rebounded, supports the idea that these lower
end consumers are going to continue spending pretty well and that seems to be a
positive for discount retailers, such as Wal-Mart, Target and Dollar Stores.
So going forward, we expect that in the macro perspective, it's really going to be
about the jobs numbers because the -- we don't expect there is necessarily going to
be great movement in upwards in equities (inaudible) hikes.
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
Thanks, Josh. So one of the biggest issues we are following in the last few months
were the strengthening of the US dollar versus foreign currencies, in particular we
were following the Euro and the Chinese Yuan and the movement there. Now, a lot
have been said already about brands and global brands that has signiﬁcant amount
of their revenue come outside of the US, over there you still -- obviously because of
the strengthening of the dollar, when you translate those sales numbers into US
dollars, you probably going to get some unit growth and that was accounted for by
analysts and investors.
Another issue is threatening of the US dollar, it's obviously the tourism, and how it
impacts tourism, speciﬁcally coming into the US, when the dollar gets stronger,
obviously, it's harder for tourists to come here, it's more expensive for them. Now we
have to keep in mind that in terms of looking at the full-year, fourth quarter is not the
highest in terms of visitors coming into the US. That happens usually around
summertime and the number of tourists coming into the US. But the fourth quarter is
still -- has a signiﬁcant number of visitors coming here and shopping in retail stores.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-16
Costco Wholesale Corp (COST US Equity)
Page 4 of 11Seema ShahThe American numbers, we don't have them as of late, but we do have some
numbers on the Chinese side, and if you look at the third quarter, number that came
out, Chinese tourism into the US was down 12% and that's the ﬁrst decline that I've
seen in a very long time. So we can expect the same trend with European tourism as
well.
And what it does, if you're a retailer and you have a exposure to the metro cities in
the US where you have outlets in a lot of tourist destinations, retailers like big
department stores or specialty apparel and Tiﬀany's, those kind of retailers has
exposure to those big tourism destination and you can expect much lower traﬃc
during this time of holiday and as a result of lower sales. We are expecting this
challenging trend going into the fourth quarter, maybe continue in the ﬁrst quarter
and it deﬁnitely becomes as a negative and it's been said last week that some of the
department stores are negative to traﬃc and negative to sales.
Switching a little bit and talk about timing of the holidays this year. Usually --
historically, we look at the number of days between Black Friday and Christmas, --
I'm sorry, -- just in terms of the timing of the holidays, looking how many days we
have Black Friday and Christmas, and last year we had 27 days, this day -- this year
we have 28 days. So we see a little bit of tailwind there in terms of the number of
days, you have one extra selling day, which can be looked as a positive for retailers.
But a couple of caveats there. First of all, Christmas this year falls on a Friday, which
can be looked as a little bit of a negative, it takes the urgency out of the prior
weekend to the holiday and kind of lift the last few days before Christmas being
regular business weekdays. So that's a little bit of a negative. On top of that, last year
we had Hanukkah and Christmas very close to each other, which created this
momentum going into the last week before Christmas, we don't have that catalyst
this year, Hanukkah falls much earlier in December 6th, which creates somewhat of a
wall between those two kind of large holidays in terms of shopping.
So all in all, one extra selling day, which is a positive, partially oﬀset by a Christmas
falling on a Friday and Hanukkah being a little bit separated from Christmas.
And with that, I just want to move to Seema to talk about Black Friday itself.
{BIO 18919310 <GO>}
Hi, thank you. Black Friday remained the biggest spending day of the holiday
season, but lately, in recent years it's important that it has been declining overall
within the holiday season, with the growth of e-commerce and as promotions are
beginning earlier and lasting longer. Overall, since the recession, the retail market
has been more promotional and consumers have been spreading out their holiday
shopping throughout the year, with over 14% of their consumers beginning their
holiday shopping before Halloween, according to the NRF.
So, as more and more people, I think through today, I think over 56% of people have
already begun or more than halfway completed with their holiday shopping. So, allFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-16
Costco Wholesale Corp (COST US Equity)
Page 5 of 11Chen Grazutis
Seema ShahBlack Friday remains very important, it's not the only day to get a deal or to get a
discount and particularly with the growth of e-commerce, people can shop
whenever they want and when it's most convenient. And 2014 Black Friday sales
declined 1.6%, though the whole weekend sales were up 90 basis points according
to MasterCard and a lot of this was driven by retailers being open on Thanksgiving
Day itself, which is a new phenomenon in the last three to ﬁve years, and last year
Thanksgiving Day sales were up 3.3%.
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
Thanks Seema. Just jumping on weather a little bit. Well, a lot of people said, the
weather this year and how -- it's warmer than usual. It is well documented in the
media this year, as we have a strong El Nino, which usually is characterized by a
warmer and drier weather in the Northern part of the country versus little bit colder
and wetter when you talk about the Southern part of the country. And so far, we've
seen this -- what was expected before the season played out pretty accurately,
September and October with much warmer in the US than the normal levels, and so
far, we have a mild November. What it does to inventories when you have -- if you
are a retailer with a large exposure to apparel merchandise, you have most of your
inventory sits on the ﬂoor starting in September. If the weather is not cooperating in
September and October, you might be pressed to start discounting this inventory
and move it, as you approach the holiday.
In addition, a lot of the retailers have orders already set up for some of the weather
related merchandise for November and December. So you might be able to
postpone it or even cancel it, which can hurt further up the supply chain. And that's
what we kind of seeing right now and last week if you follow the department stores
earnings call, some of them attribute the weather as a big impact to their inventory
pick up and slower sales. Obviously, it's really hard to predict the weather, but it
seems like so far this trend has been holding up and it's warmer than usual. So
deﬁnitely a negative there.
There is one positive, there is silver lining that I would like to mention, if you are a
retailer to have the smaller exposure to apparel, you might be better oﬀ. If you're
talking about Discounters, if you're talking about Dollar Store's, or even jewelry, I'd
say, furniture, or warmer and dry weather, that might motivate shoppers to go out
and actually shop at physical stores as supposed to sitting in home and shop online,
while it's snowing outside. So if there is a silver lining that might be hit. It still going
to hurt, if you're a retailer, that sells a lot of apparel, it's deﬁnitely a negative. So that's
a little bit about the weather.
I'm going to shoot it back to Seema to get us over to some stats [ph].
{BIO 18919310 <GO>}
So I just wanted to talk a little bit about toys this year. Toys along with clothing and
fashion accessories will be our top three categories for holiday this year. Hi-tech toys
include maybe a smart teddy bear from Metal [ph] or Star Wars product, particularlyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-16
Costco Wholesale Corp (COST US Equity)
Page 6 of 11Jitendra Waralitems such as a lightsaber, any other Star Wars theme to merchandise. Other top toys
this year maybe LEGO [ph] and video games.
So far through September of this year, US toys sales have been up over 7% and its
projected to end the year up 6% year-over-year according to NPD. The toy industry
has been relatively stagnant recently around 21 billion, so this is a huge opportunity
for the industry. Star Wars in particular will be driving a lot of the sales and expected
to drive up to 1 billion in toy sales according to Jim Silver of TTPM.
So toys are very important and the strong growth in toys will be a boon to struggling
retailer toys arrest, as well as other retailers with a large toy presence such as Wal-
Mart, Target and Amazon. Other beneﬁciaries maybe someone like Hasbro, who is
the maker of the Star Wars-themed toys.
I just wanted to jump in a little bit about give you more detail on commerce. While
there has been a lot of discussion as to how large total holiday sales will be this year,
there's no dispute in the importance of e-commerce. According to eMarketer as
Poonam mentioned, e-commerce sales will we up almost 13% to $18 billion this year
with penetration increasing to 9%. Online sales continued to be driven by
convenience, larger product assortments and mobile shopping.
As smartphone penetration has increased to over 70% in the US and screen sizes of
phones have increased, making them a little bit closer to tablet size, mobile
commerce has continued to grow as more convenient and easier for people to shop
online. M-commerce should grow 32% in 2015 and may be up to 25% of US e-
commerce transactions by the end of 2016.
I'm going to pass it over to my colleague Jitendra; he's going to talk a little bit more
about social media commerce. Jitendra?
{BIO 15423976 <GO>}
Thanks, Seema. I'll brieﬂy touch on the social media, Amazon and mobile commerce
with the holiday season in context. Social media will play a prominent role this
holiday season but the buy buttons that Twitter and Facebook are pitching may take
some time to gain traction with consumers. Most of social media use for this holiday
season will be product research and discovery as a Deloitte's survey, you see on the
screen indicates, where shoppers -- because shoppers regard quick and free
shipping as the shop criteria for their online purchase decision.
So competitive threats to likes of Amazon from social media companies may be
lower in the near-term until the logistics issues are resolved. Only 9% of US Internet
users are expected to shop online directly on social media sites this holiday season
according to an eMarketer survey, so that should give you some indication of what
the near-term impact from social media would be. But for e-commerce giants, the
outlook seems more optimistic than retailers with three key factors helping Amazon's
core business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-16
Costco Wholesale Corp (COST US Equity)
Page 7 of 11Seema ShahSo number one, prime subscriber growth with free trials during the holiday season
may help raise their prime install base. Number two, this Fulﬁllment by Amazon
program, or FBA, its expanding Amazon selection and channeling those products of
the prime consumers, who spent signiﬁcantly more. FBA may expand selection
under the prime umbrella this holiday season and that also helps drive sales.
To put things in context, Amazon's total e-commerce market share in the US has
surpassed 30% over the trailing 12 months. And this is being helped by its third-party
unit sales and mostly by the FBA program. A survey by EYTM [ph] Research for prime
members in the US, show that 45% of US prime members place order on Amazon a
few times a month, about 20% at least once a week. So that sort of gives us some
context about why this holiday season is going to be so important for Amazon to
push its prime installed base.
Moving on to mobile. Mobile will play a signiﬁcant role this holiday season, with
usage surging and -- but the apps are going to play a very critical role. Apps account
for about 58% for mobile commerce transactions today, a number which should rise
with concerns about ad blockers coming up, because apps are less susceptible for
ad blockers to change the user experience. Structurally consumers are spending
more time with an app, so if your experience within apps are hindered, the sales
might get impacted, smartphone users are spending 86% of their time in apps
according to Flurry Analytics report. So apps are going to be very critical.
So three things to keep in mind this holiday season, social media risks to e-
commerce giants maybe limited on logistics concerns, prime subscriber growth will
be the focus for Amazon, it should beneﬁt from its FBA program and apps are going
to be very critical for sales as mobile commerce continues to rise.
I'll turn it over to Seema to talk a bit more about ad blockers and its impact.
{BIO 18919310 <GO>}
Thank you. I just wanted to continue a little bit more what Jitendra said, about the
use of ad blocking technology, which is essentially a technology on a browser or an
app that ﬁlters, changes or removes an ad from the webpage.
Use of ad blockers is at 48% in the US for 2Q according to Adobe. Overtime as
penetration of this type of technology grows; retailers could be negatively aﬀected
as their ability to advertise and promote their merchandise may be hindered. This
will probably hurt their ability to drive market share and businesses whose online
presence is funded by advertising will also be negatively aﬀected.
Thus far, ad blocking penetration on mobile has been limited, but longer term, this is
a negative to retailers as Jitendra said, such as Bed Bath & Beyond, Pier 1, Williams-
Sonoma, Target, and Macy's and others that are depended on online and
omnichannel strategies to compete with players such as Amazon. Especially critical
as consumers are expected to complete 46% of their shopping -- a holiday shopping
online this year, up 200 basis points from last year according to the NRF.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-16

Seema ShahPoonam, I'm just going to turn it over to you now to talk about holiday hiring.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Thanks. So, we've heard a lot about mobile, tablet and online sales contributing to
holiday sales this year, but what we now focus on is a brick and mortar part of it
mostly, which is, our retailers are staﬀed to meet the growing demand for both
online sales and in-store sales?
And if you look at this slide here, you can see that most retailers are staﬃng more
personnel for the holiday season this year than last year with the exception of Toys
"R" Us and JCPenney. On average excluding those two, there will be a 13% increase
in seasonal hiring. But what's more important on this slide, if you focus your attention
to the last column, as the percent of change in average employee versus last year
and you can see here that we have an increase of 30% cold [ph] which is pretty
signiﬁcant and it's a combination of what we think to be more online sales, so
staﬃng -- employees, not only at the stores, but also at the distribution centers and
since stores have now mostly rolled out by online pickup in-store, they do need to
also fulﬁll demand by hiring more people there and recently you probably have seen
Target's new launch of Curbside, which also demand associates to be staﬀed to fulﬁll
orders for any drive-ups that may come up.
So the optimism is deﬁnitely there for holiday hiring and that suggests the holiday
sales should increase over last year, but with Penney's and with Toys "R" Us, I think
just cost-cutting initiatives are probably holding them back from hiring more
seasonal employees.
{BIO 18919310 <GO>}
And I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the delivery option and how that
aﬀects online. As e-commerce penetration is rising, delivery choices are increasingly
critical part of consumers' decision-making process. Their ability to buy online or
pickup in-store, receive free shipping is driving 47% of consumers' decisions as to
where to shop online this year.
As free shipping is the key driver of online traﬃc, particularly for millennials, who are
focused on same day delivery. Retailers must oﬀer these incentives to drive traﬃc to
their sites and convert sales, often at the expense of gross margin. This holiday, many
retailers are oﬀering free shipping on all purchases, including Target and Best Buy,
though the largest retail Wal-Mart has maintained its free shipping over -- on
purchases only over $50, and instead its pushing consumers to buy online and pick
up in the store, which will hopefully for the them drive incremental or impulse
purchases and save on gross margin. But overall, many retailers are ﬁnding that the
free shipping is necessary to drive traﬃc but it comes at a cost to them on the
margin line.
And then Poonam is going to talk a little bit more about some of these other
expenses that retailers are facing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-16
Costco Wholesale Corp (COST US Equity)
Page 9 of 11Poonam Goyal
Michael Halen{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Yes. So, Seema talked about just increased online shipping that retailers are oﬀering
by oﬀering it for free. But it comes at a cost and it will hurt retailers' margins. We saw
that UPS and FedEx are both boosting holiday hiring, which suggest that there will
be increased packages being shipped. But if you look at the next -- if you look at it,
FedEx plans to add up to 55,000 employees for the season, and UPS is adding twice
that 95,000 seasonal workers. So that's a lot of people delivering packages and until
we have grown we'll probably continue to see more seasonal workers hired by UPS
and FedEx to meet this growing or the surge in demand for online packages as it
save consumers time to go to the store and really just helps get the package to them
more conveniently.
For FedEx and UPS, if you look at the next slide have also raised their rates. So they
continued to increase rates for about -- at least two to three years now about 5%
each and that's pretty signiﬁcant for retailers to absorb. So I don't think they'll be
able to oﬀset it, since they're oﬀering free shipping for most orders and -- or at a low
minimum at $50 or $100. So it deﬁnitely will hit their bottom line, FedEx raised
(technical diﬃculty) by 4.9% and ground packages and so did UPS and that will
continue to happen, especially as cost increase per them to staﬀ, these workers and
there is still a trucker shortage in the US.
So they are paying premium wages to these truckers who are driving the packages
to the consumers and (technical diﬃculty) need to hurt retailers margins as they
continue to pay more, they continue to ship more, we probably will continue to see
gross margins being pressured and that's in the holiday season, and probably
through 2016.
I'll now pass it over to Mr. Chen [ph] to talk about just teen exposure.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Hi. Thanks, Poonam. Yeah. Among the linear problems US department stores are
facing, including some of the ones we've spoken about like weather, the slowdown
in tour spending and most importantly, the excess of inventory that they have going
into 4Q, exposure to oil producing regions may be another one. Oils had drastic
decline. Over the last year, it has caused oil producers to cut back on spending and
there has been some talk that Texas's economy is diversiﬁed, but restaurants with
exposure to Texas or Louisiana and Oklahoma, including Brinker, Del Frisco's, Buﬀalo
Wild Wings and Texas Roadhouse have all cited weakness in the September end
quarter.
So the department stores with the most exposure would be stage stores with 38% of
their stores in the region and Dillard's, who reported a 4% same-store sales decline
this morning, with 28% of their stores in the region. In terms of the department chain,
smart (inaudible) store chains with less exposure, Nordstrom's only has about 7% of
their stores in the regions and Kohl's just about 9%.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-16

A - Poonam GoyalQuestions And Answers
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
Thanks, Mike. We'll give a minute here to kind of line up some questions to the
speakers. We have one, that we got during this presentation. And I think I'm going to
let Poonam answer this one, I think it's kind of relevant to her coverage.
Some of the recent retailers have reported 3Q earnings show up an uptick in
inventory levels in 3Q. How do you see this plays out during the holiday season and
even beyond that going into 2016? So a question about inventory levels going
forward. Poonam?
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Thanks, Chen. So, we obviously don't want to see an inventory built heading into
holiday. Retailers are obviously going to be promotional on the current inventory
that they have planned and now they only have more to add to it. So it's deﬁnitely a
negative for the holiday season and if holiday demand doesn't exceed current
targets of mid-single-digits, then we're probably going to see excess of inventory
into 2016, which then will hurt 1Q margins as well. So it's a negative in total, 4Q
probably worse than 1Q.
And if they can't pull orders back, which at this point, with just making sure they
don't have shipment delays or anything. Retailers probably have most of their
holiday inventory in stores and are just playing catch up. This inventory average [ph]
is going to hurt their margins and it could probably result in more promotions earlier
than we would expect if the weather continues to be warm and retailers continue to
pile inventories.
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
Thanks, Poonam. We did get another one that I think is also relevant to you. This
question is about rising payrolls. Do you see it going forward continuing and some
of the impact to retailers about payroll?
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Yeah. I deﬁnitely think once again that's also a negative impact. And we saw it just a
few months ago with Wal-Mart, when they took down their guidance, how big eﬀect
increased payroll can have on the retailers. We are seeing retailers pay more to their
associates, oﬀer more beneﬁts, and while that's good for morale, while that's good
for getting more experienced hires and for employee retention and so forth it does
hit the bottom line.
And we're going to see no diﬀerence this holiday, especially because retailers are
also adding seasonal hires. Those seasonal hires typically get paid more and with the
spread now narrowing between permanent workers and seasonal workers, they
probably would have to increase their pay as well and that will be a drag to theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-16

Page 11 of 11A - Chen Grazutisbottom line in 4Q and will be a drag as long as the retailer continues to raise the
payroll and doesn't cycle past that increase, which from the ones that have
announced it, like Wal-Mart won't until 2017.
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
Okay. With that, we don't have -- if we don't have any other questions, we'll wrap it
up. We did hear that with some technical diﬃculties to hear some of the presenters. I
just want to make sure that you know that we will e-mail the presentation to
everybody who actually attended the webinar, so no worries about that. Thank you
for joining us today. We're happy to have you and we'll see you next time. Thanks
