Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Bloomberg Intelligence, the State of the
Database Market and the Cloud Webinar today with arguably the smartest existing
databases that I have come across (inaudible).
Just to start oﬀ with some housekeeping items, today's presentation will be recorded
and available for playback. You can access the replay via the link sent to you in the
email from Bloomberg webinars. At the bottom of the slide window, you can adjust
the volume and maximize your screen. And then you can ask a question by
submitting one to the right of the slides. We will address questions at the conclusion
of the presentation.
Also just a quick word about Bloomberg Intelligence, we provide in-depth research
and data on industries, companies, credit litigation, etcetera. We have about 300-
plus people that are in our department. We cover close to 2,000 companies. So with
-- and you can access all of our research on the terminal be BI .
The agenda for today is to talk a little bit about the overall state of the database
market. How much is it going to grow? What's Oracle's cloud strategy? Comparing
Amazon to Oracle and Microsoft. The alternative database technologies from NoSQL
to Data Lakes and Carl will just present his summary and conclusions.
With that, let me pass the presentation on to Carl that can go over the discussion.
{BIO 21744954 <GO>}
Thank you very much, Anurag (ph) and before I get started in our topic for today, let
me just give myself a little bit of an introduction for you, so that you know who I am.
My name is Carl Olofson. I am Research Vice President at IDC, covering Data
Management Software. I've been in the IT industry for over 40 years. Spent part of
that time as a programmer-consultant, much of that time as a software development,
building database management software and as a Product Manager and as a
Marketing Product Manager and for the past 21 years, I've been working at IDC,
analyzing and researching the market.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-09

Page 2 of 18So over that time course, we've seen a lot of change and you'll be seeing some of
those changes reﬂected in my remarks today. Why don't we begin by talking about
the overall state of the market?
So in general terms, we're just going to -- just some high level revenue observation
of the overall market growth for relational databases, which include products like
Oracle database and Microsoft sequel server IBM Db2 and so forth, grew from 2016
to 2017 by 6.9%.
We saw most of that growth happening in the cloud and so, no surprise the
strongest growth was shown by Amazon Web Services with their products RDS
Aurora and Redshift and Microsoft with their product as your sequel database,
whereas there was tepid to declining growth for the -- sort of the big mainstays in
the industry Oracle, IBM, SAP and Teradata.
Public cloud services share of the market is approximately 11% at present and the
drivers include overall data growth. Just to say the amount -- the volume of data out
in the world and how rapidly it's growing; Edge and IoT Data Analytics, management
of analysis of Edge very important and data science.
In the non-relational space, this includes legacy products that run on the mainframe
and some many computers that are hierarchical or navigational in nature as well as
end user databases and multi-value databases. That market grew by 2.2% from 2016
to 2017, in that, it's a very stable market. Most customer relationships are decades
old. Their applications are built-in with the database very dependent on the
database and those people are very reluctant to change.
The most interesting vendor in the space is InterSystems, which has modernized
their database into something that has some completely diﬀerent characteristics and
that product is called Cache. It's mostly to be found in the healthcare sector in the
United States, but it's in a variety of sectors in other countries, especially in Western
Europe and in Australia and New Zealand.
The dynamic data management software market is the market that includes the
things we typically refer to as Data Lake or Hadoop Software as well as no sequel
database. It's called dynamic because unlike the other two products in this market
do not require scheme (ph), in other words, they can ingest data that is not deﬁned
to the system.
What that also tells you is that most of the knowledge about the deﬁnitions and rules
of the data exists in program codes rather than in any form of deﬁnitions within the
database management system.
The overall market growth for this space from 2016 to 2017 was 62% with the
dominant vendors being Microsoft with HDInsight and Cosmos DB and Amazon with
EMR and DynamoDB.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 3 of 18Most of the new development is on-prem at present, but cloud revenue drives
growth and now why is that? Why would most -- you would think if you were doing
most of the development and implementation on-prem, why would cloud be driving
the growth and that's because most of these products are open source. So people
are developing and gradually implementing these things in production using open -
- the open source model.
The open source model is a slow growth model because it's subscription-based and
it's based on people using the product ﬁrst, getting to a certain point of maturity and
the use of the product and then acquiring a subscription. So the growth rate is
slower.
Whereas in the cloud, you have to buy a subscription as soon as you go in because
you have to pay for the use of the technology in the cloud and that's why cloud
revenue is growing faster than on-prem revenue, even though the user base is larger
on prem than it is in the cloud. And that will eventually all sort of normalize out.
Drivers in this space include new operational data models, such things as managing
data in smart apps that you have in handheld devices and so forth. Handling and
routing data that maybe coming in from sensors, also general online state
management applications and gaming applications and very specialized
applications that are typically Internet based and require a lot of state data to
operate as well as specialized data analytics that require functionality that's not
native to a relational system.
So if we look at the competitive situation amongst the vendors in the three markets
that I just described and the relational area, Oracle continues to dominate with 42%
of the market, Microsoft has 24%, IBM has 13%. What is interesting here is that
Amazon Web Services has 3%, which looks really small and it's really small, but it is
the fast -- it is one of the faster growing and is that -- so that piece of the pie is
getting bigger, whereas IBM at 13%, that piece of the pie is getting smaller. The SAP
is fairly stable.
We really expect it had a lot of growth when they were driving so many of their
customers to Hanna. It sort of tapered oﬀ a bit in the past year, but we expect that
growth to continue, not as strong as before, but fairly strong nonetheless. A lot of the
damper is not because people are not moving to Hanna, but because of people
moving oﬀ of the legacy SAP products SAP ASE and SAP IQ.
In non-relational space, which is actually on the right hand side of your screen, the
dominant vendor is Microsoft with access, followed by IBM with IMS -- which is a
mainframe hierarchical database and then you see InterSystems at 14%. That
company has been growing steadily. In other words 10 years ago, it was sort of next
to other and now it's got 14%. It's actually become the third largest vendor in that
space. So important one to continue to watch.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 18In the dynamic data management software market, which is in the middle, we see
Microsoft has the largest share by a little bit with -- as I've mentioned before,
Dynamo, or sorry, Cosmos DB and HDInsight and Amazon following with EMR and,
DynamoDB, that's going to continue to be a battle or a while.
Google with -- has Bigtable, but Google is going to become an important player in
the future and Cloudera and Hortonworks interesting that they recently announced
their merger. We are not sure what this is going to mean for the company. So making
long-range projections would be a little bit irresponsible. However, I think they're
going to continue to be important in the space.
Okay. So foretasted database market growth we expect the relational database
market to grow by 7.7%. Compound annual growth rate to 2022 and the drivers
include the continued need for analytic -- the need for analytic transaction
processing, that means blending in analytic queries to transaction processing.
Most transaction processing today involves just a few simple background queries
such as you know, if you're processing an order, you look up the customer and that
sort of thing.
These are analytic queries, that are doing things like looking for patterns and data,
not previously possible because of the overhead and demand that's placed on the
database, but with these new models that involve (inaudible) and memory-optimized
data management. They're capable of doing transactions and some fairly
sophisticated, not full-on multi-table joint type query operations, but fairly
sophisticated analytic operations against the data and so analytic transaction
processing, which you can think of as a merger of OLTP and OLAP, is going to
become increasingly important.
Also higher quarter analytics and machine learning, one of the things that we're
ﬁnding is that there was a lot of experimentation with using Hadoop and Spark for
deep analytics machine learning and they are still going to be use -- they're still
being used and will continue to be used for those things, but in many cases, people
have found, they need the discipline of the relational database and they're moving
that functionality back into the relational sphere.
The cloud will be a signiﬁcant factor in relational database in the last couple of years
of the forecast. In other words, it's a ﬁve year forecast. A lot of the companies are
preparing to move to the cloud, haven't moved much -- that much to the cloud.
Some smaller companies have moved production data to the cloud and a few
leading-edge customers have moved data to the cloud -- their production data to
the cloud, but most have not. So that's a thing to watch out for.
Non-relational database is expected to decline by 2.2% compound annual growth
rate by 2022. That's a ﬁve-year compound annual growth rate by the way. The
customers -- the users are looking to move to the cloud -- users who are looking toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 18move to the cloud who are using mainframe, hierarchical and navigation databases
are considering rewriting their applications.
For years, they wouldn't consider this, this is what kept them on those systems, but
now they're seeing that the total beneﬁt of moving to the cloud supersedes the cost
and risk involved in rewriting those applications. So they're starting to look at that.
Multi-value databases will probably be ﬂat, but not decline, which is important to
know. So these are like the PICK databases and so forth and end user legacy
mainframe will decline. A lot of the end user database functionality is now made
available by other means, various kinds of in memory, analytics sandboxes and
things that people used to use, things like Microsoft Access for and so forth. So we
think that those are going to, in general decline.
The dynamic data management software market system is expected to grow to -- by
30% CAGR over 2022, again a ﬁve-year CAGR that's following a fairly normal growth
curve for this market. I'm sure there are others who have more aggressive forecast
from this, but because we're dealing with a space that's mostly open source, the
revenue forecast estimates need to be necessarily conservative.
The rapid growth of open source usage has resulted in lots of -- lots of users, but not
lots of revenue, but we think that most of those accounts will subscribe over the ﬁve-
year period and that's going to be a major growth driver in the space.
The document databases are also becoming more business-friendly. They're doing
things like they're including support for asset transactions, which never existed
before in document database, well except from MarkLogic, but not in the other
document databases and they're also adding enterprise-level security features.
Obviously data security is a major concern for everyone these days and if you're
going to be putting data, especially personal identifying information in document
databases, you need to make sure that they're secure and can't be hacked.
In the Data Lake space, they're settling into a supporting role. Years ago people
thought that Hadoop is going to take over everything. Didn't quite work out that
way. Hadoop of course is designed as a data collection space, driven by
MapReduce. However, MapReduce today appears to be adopting a very limited role
of initial ingest processings, sorting, ﬁltering and formatting or organizing the data
and then the rest of the work, all the analytic work it seems is being handed over to
Spark.
HDFS survives as a ﬁle -- standardize ﬁle format for this environment and will
continue, but it's unclear as to how much of the rest of the Hadoop cluster
management, ﬁle management technology will actually come into play, especially as
people move their Data Lakes to the cloud and look to see the data on cloud native
object storage and run Spark directly against that, which seems to be a raising
model for use.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 18This also means that the Cloudera Hortonworks combination will need to basically
rise above the general den of confusion with respect to Data Lakes by oﬀering very
comprehensive enterprise-friendly packages of capability that make it
straightforward to deploy and manage.
Okay. So for forecasting these are the ﬁve-year forecast for the three markets. I know
the print is small. I think you have access to the slides after this. So you can look at
that at your leisure. As you can see, the growth rates I mentioned are reﬂected here.
The interesting thing to notice about these forecast is that the top part of each
column is the cloud forecast and the bottom part is the on-prem.
So as you can see, for relational database, the on-prem is actually about ﬂat, it's
growing, it's growing by a percentage point or 2 less than 2% I think. Whereas in the
dynamic data management software space, the cloud portion is the part -- portion is
doing most of the growing.
There is gradual growth on-prem and that's because people who have deployed
various document database like MongoDB and Couchbase and so forth are
purchasing licenses to protect their investment, their eﬀort investment in putting
corporate information or at least business important data into those systems.
But as they grow, we expect that most of them will be deploying in the cloud and a
lot of new development will be going on the cloud for the very simple reason that
the cloud is non-demand environment and we are doing development.
This way you can just sort of say, I want to have a server of a certain size, of a certain
amount of storage to do my development work on and immediately it's there.
Whereas if you're operating in -- on a non-prem context, you have to make a
requisition for the server, for the storage, you have to reserve the time for those
systems, etcetera, etcetera and that slows down the development process and we
are living in agile times when slow is no go.
The non-relational database picture is on the right. As you can see it's declining. The
only part that's showing some growth is cloud. There'll be a few elements, probably
mostly in the end user space, things like ﬁle maker and so forth, that will -- that will
be growing in the cloud the way that picture looks.
Okay. So as far as Oracle's cloud strategy is concerned, a lot of questions have come
up about this. It's important to understand that the cloud is a critical success factor
for Oracle. They have as an absolute priority to move their as customers as many as
possible to the Oracle cloud, not just to the cloud, but to the Oracle cloud.
It's important to maintain account control, which has always been the key to Oracle
success and it's largely for this reason Oracle came out with the autonomous
database service versus the Oracle autonomous data warehouse service and now
they've been talking a lot about our transactional service, which will be -- which we'll
learn more about at Oracle OpenWorld.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 18These things are necessary in order to do two things. One is to demonstrate the
value of the cloud as a place where you no longer have to assume responsibility for
the physical management of the database, but also because you don't have to apply
your own patches. You don't have to do any of those things, which means that the
database is going to be available all the time. It's going to be running at top
performance levels and your DBA and some technical people can work with
developers to create applications and adjust systems to match enterprise needs
rather than constantly tuning with database.
So that's the value proposition of Oracle, the kind of database in a nutshell. And to
be honest it is the most clear demonstration of why not just the cloud, but the Oracle
cloud is important, because of course, the autonomous database is being managed
by Oracle personnel, who are presumably the most knowledgeable and expert in
managing that environment and they can also enjoy economies of scale because
they are managing multiple customer instances at the same time and therefore their
eﬀorts are -- their eﬀorts are spread across those and so it works out well for them
and for the customer.
This is really important to Oracle because it means that if they're successful with this
program, they can retain the bulk of their database customer base, which is as I said,
it's key to them. If customers move their Oracle databases to other clouds, such as
AWS or Azure or Google or something else, that would be bad for Oracle because
now they don't have that level of account control any more.
They have to split the customer's attention and interaction between themselves and
the cloud provider and that could ultimately mean not only that the customer spends
less with Oracle and is less inﬂuenced by Oracle. But that they even could
contemplate moving to another database systems such as Aurora or Spanner or
something else and that would be a disaster for Oracle. So keeping Oracle
customers on the Oracle cloud very important.
Ideally those same customers will also if they are in the Oracle cloud, use Oracle
infrastructure as a service for the non-Oracle workloads. In other words, they'll
choose to keep all the data and operations together and that's obviously -- that's
what they're pushing forward as well and you hear this, and if you read their
quarterly reports and the management remarks, you'll see the infrastructure as a
service coming up all the time for that reason.
They also want to attract new customers. Now this is important because Oracle has
not historically been really good at attracting new customers and the reason is pretty
simple. Oracle has a large and expensive direct sales force and that direct sales force
in order to get -- to justify the cost of sale that's embedded in using such a sales
force, that sales force is concentrated on the largest users, which means that smaller
users really don't get the attention.
And therefore Oracle has had a hard time attracting them. Oracle has tended to
respond to this problem by working with third parties with ISPs and with consultantsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 8 of 18who can bring in smaller customers, but that sometimes gets in the way of their own
product strategy and historically, they haven't done a real good job of managing all
that together.
So moving to the cloud alleviates the essential problem because the Oracle cloud
provides a direct means of ordering up services and so people can sign up online
and adopt the pay as you grow pricing model, which means that when they're just
using a little data, they pay a little and few processors and when they use more, they
pay more and that is attractive on several levels.
One is that the Oracle customers don't have to deal with the sales person, which a
lot of people are glad for. They know exactly what they're getting and they are in
control of how the account progresses.
In fact, it can be said that even for larger customers, this model reduces the amount
of interaction they need to have with the salesperson, once they move to the Cloud
because they can see exactly where they stand. There will be no more audits, which
everybody hates, but instead they will see where they stand online and they can
make adjustments accordingly and it's -- everything is transparent and that should
improve customer relations because customer relations between Oracle, typically
what you ﬁnd is the technologists really like Oracle. The DbAs really like Oracle. The
program really like Oracle. The business people don't, because of the friction that's
created by the Oracle audit and having to deal with the Oracle sales force, which is
powerfully motivated to increased sales wherever possible. So this could help them
with customer relations.
There was a question about BYOL or Bring Your Own License, largely motivated by
customer demand that wasn't originally part of the Oracle cloud plan, but Oracle
found that a lot of customers wanted to apply the value of their existing license to
the cloud and so in order to get them to move to the cloud more swiftly, they
adopted this policy, removes that friction so that accounts can apply their licenses in
the cloud and get credit for them.
And there is another reason why customers want to use their licenses or at least use
perpetual used licenses in the traditional form and that is that they're license
management people or typically lawyers or contract management people. There are
uncomfortable subscriptions who are then dealt with them before.
They understand the perpetual use license contract and support contracts very well
because they've been working with them for years. And they're not sure of all the
implications of switching to a subscription.
We think that over time, they will switch to a subscription model because it gives
them more ﬂexibility. Obviously, Oracle likes it because it gives them more of a
guaranteed revenue stream, but for the time being there is some reluctance and so
the BYOL policy in general, the policy of reporting perpetual used licenses in theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 18Cloud are necessary to overcome the objections I mentioned and get more people
on the cloud sooner.
So in comparing Amazon, Oracle and Microsoft in the relational database sphere,
they really represent very diﬀerent -- their backgrounds are very diﬀerent. Amazon
has been the -- has been sort of a darling of new application developers. These
application developers who come to AWS to build applications that they make
available to users in the cloud.
They really like everything about Amazon and from relation, when they need a --
transactional relational database, they naturally turn to Amazon for that too. Now
RDS -- which is a relational database service, has a number of options in it, including
a number of databases they don't control such as Oracle and Microsoft and my SQL
and PostgreSQL.
However, Aurora is the one that's not only managed by Amazon, but is optimized by
Amazon for the AWS environment and so customers like that idea, it has had a
MySQL service layers so that you can take a code that's from MySQL and run around
it and it now also has a PostgreSQL service layer, so you can go with either of those
depending on how you've chosen to write your application.
That's gaining a lot of popularity within the AWS community and Redshift is their
analytic database. It's their sort of data warehouse platform if you will and it's just
those there -- it's a fairly frictionless adoption process for people who are committed
to the AWS environment.
With Microsoft, the situation is diﬀerent because Microsoft has a lot of legacy
obviously that makes stuﬀ spin around a long time. They have a lot of existing
customers. Their main challenge has been to move Microsoft SQL server users to
Azure AQL database because if they don't do that, it's a lot harder to move their
customers to Amazon -- sorry to Azure, because to get the most out of Azure, you
really need to have a platform that is optimized for Azure like any cloud environment
it's highly dynamic, the resources are virtualized, the system needs to be able to take
advantage of that.
And SQL server of course is designed to run on a deﬁned server, in a conventional
environment with storage and all that. And so it's not going to give you the
dynamism, the resource dynamism that you would need in the cloud. So -- but they
had a problem, which was that the two -- they represented a code for a critical upper
level, which meant that applications written for SQL server would not automatically
run as your SQL database. They would have to be changed.
So Microsoft is taking steps to change that so that the same applications can run on
either platform. It seems like that should help in moving Microsoft-based
applications on to seek Azure SQL database and therefore into Azure, which is what
they hope to do. And of course they have a lot of client, I'm sorry, they have a lot of
third-party vendors, providing software. Most of those existing Windows-basedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 18vendors have been reluctant to move to Azure until they feel that it is a frictionless
process.
So that hasn't happened a lot. There are lot of new vendors who have been
developing on Azure and been quite happy with that. But -- so it's quite possible that
we could see Azure, which has been growing fairly strongly anyway, gain even more
momentum as a result of this shift.
Emphasis on Microsoft, we do everything for your model. A big diﬀerence between
Microsoft and Amazon is that Microsoft is heavily prescriptive, meaning that they put
together the elements that you need for various used cases and say here are the
tools and elements that you need to do these things whereas Amazon is more liked
in as a Chinese menu.
There are (inaudible) Amazon you can say, you can use Azure, or you can use Oracle,
or you can use Microsoft, or MySQL any one of those, there are several MySQL
variance also available on AWS. There are all these options that you have to choose
from. It's very confusing and I've heard a lot of people complain that it's a little too
hard for them to ﬁgure out how to conﬁgure their environment there and Microsoft is
more cookbook oriented. So that's a diﬀerence there.
Oracle is they're coming from the perspective of large enterprises well established.
You need to move those enterprises, who are looking to go oﬀ -- get oﬀ the
datacenter and go the Cloud. We need to move them to the Oracle cloud. So
Oracle's ﬁrst job is customer retention in a big way and of course they have some of
them most -- the largest and most demanding customers with the most demanding
workloads and requirements and so that's been their entire focus.
Now people don't -- a lot of people may not realize it but Oracle actually has three
relational database systems. They have Oracle database times 10, which is in memory
database that was developed separately and then acquired and MySQL which was
also acquired.
The role of times 10, the role of times 10 is as a pure in-memory database that's used
for cases where in memory, the pure memory capability is critical where latencies are
very, very low and a lot of data processing these we handle in memory and where
the sizes aren't to huge. MySQL is basically its open source, it's a means of attracting
new customers. They have a large -- there's a large MySQL community and even
though many other people in that community are now using alternatives such as
perCona and MariaDB, Oracle is still actively involved in them -- that MySQL
community because it is an important prospect base for them.
So as I mentioned here, the one issue that Oracle has in moving customers to their
cloud is that many customers are reluctant to increase their dependence and
investment in Oracle because of past experience. Oracle's hoping that the changes
they've made will address that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 11 of 18So at alternative database technologies, there's been a lot of excitement over the
past 10 years, regarding so called Big Data Systems and no sequel databases and
the result -- there are a lot of -- there are a lot of breathless explanations of how
these systems are going to make relational databases absolutely as we've seen that
hasn't happened. However these new systems do address new and emerging
workloads very well in fact better than relational databases. Relational databases
continue to address the workloads that they have traditionally addressed well.
Relational database model was actually developed as a means of providing
application neutral query data, prior to the relational concept, which came out in late
60's oﬀered by Dr. Ted Codd. The only way to report on data was to write
complicated programs that could navigate the database, ﬁnd the database, look for
and then produce a report and Ted Codd's aim was to provide a system that you
could dynamically query.
And as a result its strength has been reporting and they still are because relational
database is the only architecture designed so that if you do it right, if you fully
normalize your data, you don't have to anticipate any of the questions are going to
be asked.
It will have answer any mathematically valid question that you pose to it along any
line of query. You don't have to know about the structures. You don't have to collect
certain structures to do it. You just ask the question and it would and it will give you
an answer. It's the only system works that way. All others are dependent on structures
that you have to retrieve and sift through to ﬁnd the details that you're looking for.
The reason we have transactional database is that relational databases that
customers didn't want to use one architecture for transactions and another for query.
So it was necessary to provide a database that does both and it works reasonably
well for classic two dimensional data structures such as lists and ledgers and most of
the things that we do is sort of back oﬃce accounting things and maintaining
customer list and stuﬀ like that.
It has a tough time with diﬀerent shapes then two dimensional ones, such as
precursor structures, graphs, embedded structures, graphical objects and so forth
because these demand -- these demand or a style organization that either breaks
the relational model from a perspective of how these databases work or if you try to
impose relational model on them, they just don't perform, they just can't perform.
And another aspect of this is that relational databases do require ﬁxed schema. In
other words, the relational database is schematic database, which means the
database needs to know the organization of the data before you put data into it.
Whereas the new class of Dynamic Data Management service that are out there
including no sequel and they do operate on the basis of the idea that you put the
data in ﬁrst and then discover how it's organized. So that capability is supported by
things like graph databases, in some cases people use key value stores, documentFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 12 of 18databases and object-oriented databases, which are actually also schematic, but
diﬀerent, can also serve some of those jobs and is used, especially when their
relationship is very close with a language such as Java.
So the alternative technologies include Data Lakes and what has been called no
sequel databases, which originally have actually met no sequel and then they
decided, well that's sounds too restrictive. So they call it not only sequel, but it really
-- what it really means is that well we can support a sequel interface. So if you go
through and you deﬁne data in just the right way and you mark it in just the right way
and put in some metadata, you can execute sequel, but it's really not a relational
database.
So, Data Lakes serve three basic functions. The ﬁrst is initial ingestion, which includes
all the ﬁltering, sorting, regularization. So for the also do discovery as to what data
needs to be secured and so forth and then after that, you may either export it to a
relational data warehouse or you may write it out to a object ﬁle system for analysis
by Spark or you may run Spark directly on it and now when you do that, that's largely
for these sort of deep one-oﬀ analysis conducted by data scientists who are looking
to discover patterns and anomalies in data.
So initial ingestion, deep analysis and then the third function is long-term data
retention because it's cheap. So the related technology to Data Lakes includes
Hadoop and all the sort of elements of the Apache Hadoop constellation of projects
and also object storage, particularly native cloud storage such as AWS, S3, all
operating or mediated through HDFS protocol.
Some people are starting to use Parquet ﬁles and access those, which can enable
user manage data in common format and spark, which has become the sort of pay
factor standard for most analytics in this environment.
And as an emerging role data, receiver data, organizer data router, which means it
becomes a kind of operational data hub in which data comes in both from external
sources maybe streaming sources in some cases and also from other structured,
managed internal sources and it gets combined in diﬀerent ways and moved out.
This is as I say an emerging role, but this I believe and I'm not speaking for them, but
I believe this is a direction that Cloudera, Hortonworks combination will be looking
to pursue.
In the no-sequel space we see for general beneﬁts, that the lack of schema support
means that developers can just go ahead and do their thing. They can build and
make changes to their applications at will. The applications right, documents out to
document database and the database will support it and so they can address
constantly shifting requirements, they can fulﬁll the agile development model. And
the operational constraints are not there, which gives you a greater -- required by
asset are not there, which gives you greater scalability and ﬂexibility in their casesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-09

putting in the database, consistency isn't really an issue.
Now, when it is an issue when there are formal relationships, then you need to be a
little more worried about those things. Document databases are key on the
operational side for no SQL databases that their contents are deﬁned by application
code, but they are self-deﬁning meaning that the ﬁeld names actually occur in the
documents.
The documents can become inconsistent, which makes analytics diﬃcult, because
remember there's nothing controlling this. You can put rules in some of these --
some of these systems while you put rules in to force documents to be more
consistent, but it's not a primary requirement.
And there, most commonly used for online session management maintaining the
data, session data as users use in online environment, which is important, not only
for recoverability of user session, but also for later analysis and tracking.
Also for IOT tracking and which is IOT data tracking and for gaming applications,
very common and popularly used for gaming applications. Other no SQL systems
include Viacom stores such as Cassandra, which is also Agile. You can add new
comps at will -- but it doesn't do great at complex query.
It's not that optimal for operations where performance is an issue, but it's pretty
good for analytics, particularly aggregation analytics against very, very large
collections of data. And the other key value stores, which are mainly used for the
shared persistence of application internal data and also key value stores underlie a
number of document databases that are out there as well.
So you have sort of like a two layer system. You got the document, management
layer on top and then you got the key value store underneath. And actually key value
stores are usually being used by some emerging relational database systems as well.
Now I am going to wrap up the formal portion here and so we can get onto the
questions. Relational databases remain core for back-oﬃce data processing
enterprise data warehouse, all the traditional boring things. Well, a lot of the
developers that you're going to encounter at Strata or at Dreamforce or whatever we
call boring, the relational databases will move to the cloud, but whose we don't
know.
Oracle, Microsoft Amazon, Contend; there are specialized providers for data
warehouse functionality like Snowﬂake out there. Interesting to see how that all
works out and in fact Teradata has a cloud called Intellicloud as well recently
developed. Data Lakes and NoSQL are primarily served new workloads and those
for which a relational database is historically ill suited. Oracle needs broad
acceptance to the Oracle cloud to thrive long term critical requirement/.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-09

Carl OlofsonMicrosoft jumped out in front with this -- with Azure and people -- when they ﬁrst
came out of Azure, people were scratching their head and said why do they even
need to do this, but it turns out to have been a really smart thing for them to do.
Amazon Web Services is as solid because they are like it doesn't matter to us. You
can buy, you can use our stuﬀ, you can use other people's stuﬀ. Will deploy it
manage it and they have Amazon's retail mentality. We have our brand products on
the shelf, but we have other brands on the shelf as well. You buy those, we still win,
because we're still doing business with you.
So Amazon -- that's Amazon's approach. It's going to continue to be their approach,
but it puts a lot of the burden of making decisions on the consumer.
MongoDB and Horton Cloudera plus Hortonworks are growing pretty well. But the
open source model makes it diﬃcult to track and predict. I mean the thing about
Open Source is that in order to know where it's going, you really need to have a
really strong sense of who's using it. but without revenue account, which is what we
do at ITC.
The only other way to do is through surveys, which we've done from time to time,
but we need to measure the user basis of these products in order to give ourselves a
better view. but we think we've got a pretty good handle on it. And we think that
MongoDB, CouchBase and others are growing pretty well in their user communities
and eventually that will translate into revenue growth as well.
So those are -- that concludes the formal portion of my presentation. I'm going to
hand it back over to Anurag and -- questions to answer.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Yeah, we have a lot of questions Carl. Let me start oﬀ with a couple of them. Then I
will read them out from the ones that are coming from the listeners and I would
again request if you have more questions, please ﬁre them ahead.
So one thing is very clear as you've mentioned, for Oracle to be successful long
term, Oracle Cloud has to succeed and we have obviously seen slowdown in that
perhaps largely because of the pace of migrations of these larger databases or their
legacy clients to cloud in general. What do you think Oracle can do to accelerate the
shift to Oracle cloud?
{BIO 21744954 <GO>}
So part of the problem, is this. They are largest customers and they really need their
largest customers to come to the Oracle cloud. Also I have the most complex
situations in their data centers and they just can't move -- they can't turn on a dime.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 15 of 18Anurag RanaIn other words, they need to -- not only do they have complex Oracle installations,
they have a lot of other technology in their data centers. They need to make a lot of
decisions. Once they've made those decisions, some of that technology can't be
moved for various reasons.
So what they are doing now is they are implementing hybrid cloud strategies and
we're going to continue to see that going on for a while. As they formulate their
plans, the other thing is that they have a lot of technology in the data center that is
on depreciation schedule. They're not going to stop. They're not going to turn oﬀ
expensive servers and storage systems until they've hit their depreciation limit. So
that means that timing becomes important as well.
So we really didn't expect a large number of those customers to have moved by
now. I think what you've seen is that there is a sort of initial rush of people with the
pent-up demand. We're past that now. And now we are into the more serious long
term -- how do we get there kind of thing and it's just going to take several years. I
don't know what Oracle could do to speed that up. One thing that they have -- there
are two things they have done.
One is the Oracle Autonomous Database Technologies that they've come out with is
attractive enough that once it's mature shown to be mature and right now we don't, -
- we've got a lot of people, we've talk to are beta customers. They need another year
for us to get the experience of the people who have these technologies and
production particularly because the transactional one isn't even available yet. But
those are things that can help accelerate the process of moving to the cloud
because it makes it easier.
The other thing -- the other thing is this thing called Oracle Cloud Customer and this
is a box that they have that works like a -- that works like a little piece of the Oracle
cloud in your datacenter. So for people who say, well I can't move most of my
systems yet. I'm not ready to do that, and they have to interact with these Oracle
systems on a very low latency basis and so that we need to keep them connected to
our internal network.
You say -- okay, no problem, put in Oracle cloud customers. They run the Oracle
database, Oracle is managing the database for you and right now Oracle clouded
customer doesn't actually support Oracle at times database, but we think it will in the
not too distant future.
You put that in and that way you can sort of have your cake and eat it too because
you can start the process of Cloud icing parts of your data center while actually
keeping those elements in the data center physically connected through your
internal network to the other systems. So that -- those are two things that Oracle is
doing to try to accelerate that process.

Page 16 of 18Carl OlofsonFair enough and we have seen now your stock works in a similar way and use a
hybrid methodology. But let's talk about those legacy enterprises. So if I'm a very
large customer that I'm an Oracle shop that I've been using Oracle databases for
several years, and I'm a fairly big customer. I am one of your the most high paying
customers for Oracle.
If and when I decide to move my database to the cloud, what is the probability that I
would go with either Oracle or Amazon or Microsoft like, which way am I more
skewed to given my legacy investments?
{BIO 21744954 <GO>}
So I don't think there's a one size ﬁts all answer that question because it depends on
what you're using the database for and how many specialized Oracle features you're
using. If it's an in-house developed application and you have lots of PLC sequel,
you're probably going to stick with Oracle technology.
Now that doesn't mean you go the Oracle cloud. You could deploy Oracle and AWS
rents and I think, believe you can even deploy it in Azure, but people who are going
to go to Azure are people who are Microsoft-centric, I believe, and there Microsoft-
centric people who have some Oracle systems and there are Oracle-centric people
who have some Microsoft system. So if you're Microsoft-centric, you're going to be --
the appeal of Azure is going to be pretty strong, but if you have a lot of PLC sequel,
you're not going to move to another data.
On the other hand, if you don't, if you mostly just use sort of generic sequel
functions and third party applications that support multiple databases, then you
might consider switching database systems as part of your cloud conversion
process, which then means go anywhere and we see people considering all of these
things.
I tend to think at the end of the day that most of the large Oracle customers are
more conservative in that and will stick with Oracle just because it's what they've
used. They're not sure what would happen if they try to move their databases to
another system. The mid-sized ones are the ones that might go to say an enterprise
DB based post solution or something like that or they may even switch altogether.
Every vendor as you probably know has their Oracle conversion tool that is
supposed to help you move Oracle databases to their platform. So, but for those
with a heavy investment in Oracle, I really don't see them moving oﬀ of Oracle and
the appeal of the Oracle cloud, especially if you're also using Oracle applications
pretty great.
So the questions, I would ask are how heavily customized is your Oracle environment
to use lots of PL sequel? Two, are you using lots of Oracle applications? Are you
dependent ib Oracle applications? If either of those is the case, you're likely to go
with Oracle and to go the Oracle cloud. If neither of those is the case, then there are
-- there is a variety of options you might consider.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-09

That begs the second question and in the case of the second example that you gave,
how easy is it to migrate a large database oﬀ of Oracle to let's say Amazon or
somebody else?
{BIO 21744954 <GO>}
Well the ﬁrst thing you would need to do is look at the characteristics of the
database or maybe it's a data warehouse. I don't know and ask yourself can the
proposed target system handle it? And the answer to that may eliminate a lot of what
you would consider potential options.
If I'm looking at a large complex database data warehouse for instance, I'm probably
more likely if I want to move oﬀ of Oracle and probably more likely to consider
another database system that's designed to handle large complex data whereas
such as Teradata rather than something like RedChip couldn't handle it.
But the feedback that we've gotten is that data warehouse users tend to be more
comfortable with those larger more highly scalable environments. Now, if that's not
the case, if the databases what we might say fairly prosaic and not too large, then
there are a number of possible choices and I've talked to customers who have
migrated such databases to other platforms and they seem quite satisﬁed.
So it's all a question of what's there, but if I'm moving a large complex Oracle
database, transactional database, I would do a lot of due diligence in examining the
potential targets as a moving -- something as moving to the Azure sequel database
for instance.
You'd have to do a proof of concept project to determine whether or not it can
handle the load, but if you decide to go that route, as I said before, there are --
everybody has their Oracle conversion tool and there are also third party Oracle
conversion tools out there.
So that there are ways and means of doing it, but I would also assume that it is not a
risk free and eﬀort free exercise. There is. There are going to be catches. They're
going to be a few things. We didn't anticipate this. So that's all part of the if you will,
the friction that presents itself in making such a conversion.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Fair enough. One last question and we'll call it oﬀ, given that we've almost close to 1
o'clock. One of the clients -- one of the questions is about is Google Cloud platform
even in the running or it's a completely irrelevant in your view?

Carl OlofsonOh, no. I don't think it's a relevant at all. Google is of course a late-comer in terms of
presenting a cloud platform that is considered suitable for enterprise data
management but -- and I think that spanner is too new a product to build a
formulated opinion about it. The white paper looks good.
But we have to see real customer cases before we -- before we know how to
interpret it, but they're going to do everything they can. I think that most of the
deployments will be new applications initially at least on the Google cloud platform,
but a number of vendors have very good relationships with Google and have
committed to GCP support.
And also the other thing to bear in mind about GCP is that not everybody is all that
comfortable with the idea of totally committing to say AWS or Azure. They like to
have a third choice out there and maybe some people will distribute some of their
resources across both platforms simply in order to give themselves a little more
ﬂexibility, so that they feel like they're not completely dependent on one vendor and
they're putting all their eggs in one basket.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Fair enough. Carl, as always is a pleasure talking to you. There are a bunch of
questions and I will try to take them oﬄine and get back to them. So with that, thank
you so much and look forward to talking to you again.
