Good morning and welcome to the Bloomberg Intelligence webinar on the
Qualcomm-Apple regulator litigation drama. My name is Anand Srinivasan and I am
a Senior Semiconductor and Hardware Analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.
On the webinar today with me are Jen Rie, our Senior Antitrust Analyst and Matt
Larson, our Intellectual Property Analyst. Also with me to answer questions is Fixed
Income Analyst, Y.C. Koh.
Before we get into the presentation, a few housekeeping notes; today's presentation
will be recorded and be available for playback. At the bottom of the slide window,
you will notice that you can adjust the volume and maximize your screen. Feel free to
ask a question by submitting one to the right of the slides. We would address Q&A
at the conclusion of the presentation. A copy of the slides will be available for
download post the presentation via email.
So let's just quickly touch on the Qualcomm primary. Most of our research, excuse
me, all of our research is available on the Bloomberg terminal by typing in BI go.
Speciﬁc company related work can be accessed by typing in the name of the ticker,
the equity and then BICO go.
So obviously with Qualcomm, the near-term business trends are overshadowed by
the antitrust and regulatory action in US, Europe and Asia. The licensing issue
particularly is under intense scrutiny, both from a business model perspective as well
as on royalty rates. And right now where it stands with the China speciﬁc handset
makers is 80% royalty compliance and they're shooting towards the 100%
compliance over the course of the next several quarters.
Legal issues however are distracting from these industry trends could aﬀect both the
chipset sales as well as the royalties. Separately Apple, Samsung and Huawei are all
trying to insource as much semiconductors as possible. And it's also losing share to
both MediaTek and Intel. The whole point of the NXP transaction was to diversify
away from handset-related sales. So auto sales where NXP is heavy was intended to
be -- to support that trend. Apple and Samsung combined to make up roughly about
40% of Qualcomm sales, if we include the Huawei, contract manufacturer, and they
were trying to oﬀset that through auto content and shipment growth.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-04-03

Page 2 of 16Jennifer RieIf you look at the speciﬁcs of the Apple litigation as well as the regulatory agency
litigation, number one, the key point is, this is going to take years. Both from the
Apple perspective, the Apple-Qualcomm litigation perspective, as well as the
regulatory agency focus, it's not going to be resolved anytime soon. There might be
a lot of rhetoric from both sides, but it's important to have a long view on this. The
key risk on the Apple litigation is that it's not speciﬁcally the potential loss of
licensing fees just from apple, but the precedent said it would set across all of the
other device makers who pay Qualcomm royalties. That particular scenario is the
highest risk scenario, and that would substantially pressure Qualcomm. Apple, Intel,
the IEEE, and everybody else in the industry are skeptical of Qualcomm's device
based royalties, which is the crux of its model.
On the antitrust side, the pressures on Qualcomm persist across three continents. It's
been subject to ﬁnes. So if you look at the global antitrust situation, there are three
speciﬁc categories that you can break it down under. The US lawsuits, which
encompasses both the FTC as well as private class action, you have the pending
non-US investigations in Korea, in EU and possibly Taiwan, you have the NXPI deal
merger review the US side has been cleared, and the FTC lawsuit would have
impeded here, you have pending EU clearance and you have pending China
clearance.
So, this is the grand list of items that we want to discuss today. And having
established sort of the context around the stuﬀ we want to discuss today, I want to
turn to Jen Rie for a second, and we've gotten this question a thousand times, which
is what if any given our litigation reviews across diﬀerent regulators, does any of this
break the NXPI deal.
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
Well, thank you Anand. Well, what we've seen already is that in the US it didn't,
because they announced clearance below expiration of the US HSR waiting period,
as of 11:59 last night. So that's really good news. It means the FTC's pending lawsuit
against Qualcomm didn't really interfere with their assessment of any overlaps
between Qualcomm and NXPI, and that they felt -- nothing was problematic there
and they were able to clear it even without an in-depth investigation, so that's good
news.
Now, on the European side, I would expect it to be similar to the US. These
regulators -- it's actually not uncommon for regulators to be investigating a company
on one set of conduct, at the same time evaluating a merger that that company has
pending with another entity. And they're supposed to keep these independent,
they're diﬀerent issues, they're diﬀerent analysis and they are good at it. They do
keep these things independent. Now, it doesn't mean that the EU couldn't consider
the Qualcomm conduct that they're looking at in their investigation as they're by
their quite possibly crash remedies in an NXPI deal, but in general, I don't see the
EU's investigation of Qualcomm conduct aﬀecting -- ultimately aﬀecting their
blocking the deal or aﬀecting the outcome of that deal.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-04-03

Page 3 of 16Anand Srinivasan
Jennifer Rie
Anand Srinivasan{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
So, what is the outcome, a potential outcome on the EU side as a result of the
conduct, and just give us a brief sense of what could happen there from a potential
path perspective?
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
Sure. So, the EU has been investigating actually for quite a long time now
Qualcomm. And their investigation is a little bit diﬀerent than what we've seen from
other regulators. It's not about the way they license their patents that are considered
standard essential patents, and whether they're not doing it in a fair reasonable way.
What the EU is looking at is whether or not certain rebates and exclusive yielding
deals and pricing that could be below cost, they are alleging it's below cost is
pushing out competitors, and in particular, they're concerned about one competitor
Icera.
And what they were saying is that that what Qualcomm was doing was oﬀering such
large rebates of low -- ultimately low cost, once you factor in the rebates to buy
exclusively chipsets from Qualcomm and not from a competitor, and that's basically
pushing Icera out of the market, and that could ultimately hurt the market and hurt
consumers in the long run. So it's diﬀerent than the ICP outcome. I think it's likely as
ﬁne as it's going to be levy here.
We saw in a really similar matter against Intel, we saw a ﬁne that was levied of $1
billion, which at that time was the biggest EU ﬁne for unilateral monopolistic non-
cartel type conduct. And if you look at -- if we ﬂip one page on in the deck, if you
look at -- my colleague in Europe, Aitor Ortiz, put together a really nice comparison
chart here showing in some ways, the way the Intel ﬁne was calculated and
comparing it to Qualcomm.
And so what you see is that the global revenues that the Intel ﬁne was based on
were $30 billion at the time and the Qualcomm revenues are estimated at $21 billion
that the ﬁne would ultimately be based on. You had ﬁve plus years of conduct in
Intel, but four years in Qualcomm, which suggests a lower ﬁne. So all in all, I see a
ﬁne is being under $1 billion, right, because you've got a lesser period of time and
lesser revenues than you had in Intel ﬁne. But I do think a ﬁne is likely. There have
been two statements of objections that the EU does seem pretty dug in with the
conduct.
Having said that, you were right, Anand, about looking at the long-term here,
because Qualcomm does tend to ﬁght these things, they have a lot of success when
they ﬁght antitrust actions. They are likely to ﬁght this and keep ﬁghting, and this
could continue to drag on.

Page 4 of 16Jennifer Rie
Anand Srinivasan
Matt LarsonSo nothing, no resolution in the near term, so from a timeline perspective, we
shouldn't look at any of the regulatory actions from US, China or Taiwan, Korea, as
being an impediment to the closure of the NXPI deal?
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
Absolutely not. That's right. I expect that deal will likely get cleared and within the
timelines that all kind of set out, they said by the end of 2017 and they do need to
formalize their ﬁlings in China and EU still to get those time clock started, but they
still have plenty of time and it passed one big hurdle yesterday by getting US
clearance and I think that it's likely they will be able to get through that and it won't
be aﬀected by these other regulatory reviews.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Yeah. And as a point, we have 16% of shares tendered as of yesterday, down from
17% when they last disclosed it, but as Jen pointed out, the time clock hasn't even
started for Europe or China. So we've got a long ways to go before deal closure, and
ahead of which regulatory clearance is required.
Matt Larson, our Intellectual Property Analyst, let's talk Apple. Can you give us a
context of the Qualcomm-Apple case? Before we could dive into the details there,
what are SEPs, what is industry standard practice, and why does everybody have a
problem with Qualcomm's royalty (inaudible) and why is it diﬀerent from standard
industry practice?
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
Yeah, sure. Thanks, Anand. That's a bunch of questions in one, so we'll parse it out a
little bit. It all essentially boil down to, if you think about Qualcomm, it's having two
components: there is the chip sales and the patent licensing more or less. We're
focused on the patent licensing here. And a large portion of Qualcomm's patent
licensing revenue are driven by a so-called standard essential patents. Kind of as a
quick primer on standard essential patents or SEPs, these are patents that cover
technology incorporated into industry interoperability standards.
So these are standards that are -- that industry groups get together, representatives
from involved companies sit down and they kind of all agree to what tech is going to
be in, either ﬁxes to current generations of technology or in future generations. So,
these are groups like the 3rd Generation Partnership Project, the 3GPP, SC, the IEEE,
these are all groups where people get together and promulgate standards. And as
part of the standard setting process, the companies oﬀer their own technology,
which gets incorporated into the tech that everybody is going to use, some of that
technology is covered by patents.
And so, as part of participating in these groups, companies agree to license their
patents to other participants and people who use those interoperability standards
on so-called FRAND terms. FRAND is an acronym for fair reasonable and non-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-04-03
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 5 of 16Anand Srinivasandiscriminatory. It basically means that everybody agrees to license patents on what is
eﬀectively roughly the same relatively low rate, the idea is we want to promote the
use of the standards and at the same time we want to compensate people who've
done the R&D in order to build out the standard.
So circling back round to the dispute and where Qualcomm sits, Qualcomm is very
actively engaged in the standard setting, particularly the dispute with Apple focusing
on the 3G/UMTS standard that uses WCDMA, it focuses on 4G LTE. And it also serves
as a little bit of a preview for what's going to go on as 5G is developed, and as 5G
starts to get rolled out in various countries over the next three to four years. And
everybody is focused on this FRAND rate issue, what is fair, reasonable and non-
discriminatory? What is the appropriate rate? What is the appropriate royalty base?
So it's not just the percentage but maybe the percentage on which you apply the
royalty to a handset. Is it the asking price? Is it some percentage of the asking price?
Parties can diﬀer on the way that that's done.
And some companies move more to a little bit of a ﬂat fee arrangement, companies
like Ericsson recently announced their preliminary rates for 5G. And so you have this
dispute where any deal that one company does on FRAND terms starts to aﬀect how
everybody else licenses their patents on FRAND terms. So it's kind of a high-level
overview, that is the SEP background on what this dispute is arising out of.
Qualcomm's issues are a little bit diﬀerent than your standard patent license or if you
think about an Ericsson or Huawei or tech pure plays that do primarily R&D and
focus patents on those, there is not as much of a combination with the chipset
business. So, companies like Samsung certainly have a chipset business, but they're
also involved in handsets, and so their motivations for protecting margins and
balancing that with how they license their SEPs are slightly diﬀerent than Qualcomm
whose chip licensing and SEP -- whose chip sales and licensing as SEPs goes hand-
in-hand.
There is also a distinction in the way that Qualcomm and Apple have licensed in the
past. Qualcomm currently licensed its patents to OEMs to the companies that put
together the iPhone, whereas Apple in the past has entered a much of direct
licensing agreements, most recently with Ericsson, directly with InterDigital who is
previously licensed through Pegatron.
And so, Apple is kind of on the chair of doing direct licensing agreements to try to
get better deals on its SEPs, and so that dispute boiled over and now we have the
lawsuit between Apple and Qualcomm directly.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it. It's important to note, for those of us who have covered Qualcomm
extensively in the past, we've seen these before, but one of the things that we have
to remember that very often this is actually decided by a bunch of lawyers trying to
interpret the potential technical specs of a particular design to see who has a right of
way if you may and therefore eligible for enforcing royalty. So roughly right now,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-04-03
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 6 of 16Matt Larson
Anand SrinivasanQualcomm's royalty rate on a weighted average handset basis on the devices it
licenses is about 2.3%. It's important to note that the diﬀerence between Qualcomm
and others, and that Qualcomm -- Qualcomm's royalty fees are based with cap
prices of course, but based on the price of the device, rather than the price of the
chip within that device that performs the function. And this is a part of a major sort of
an acrimonious issue for most of the industry participants.
It's also important to note that Apple is not currently a licensee of Qualcomm, Hon
Hai is, and it has a general contract manufacture and they pass on those charges to
Apple. Hon Hai also makes other handsets besides the iPhone, and because Hon Hai
is the one paying Qualcomm the royalties, it pays it only based on the price that
itself via iPhone to Apple, which is roughly about 45% of the handset ASP to the
retail customer assuming that Apple has roughly about 55% gross margin.
So one can interpret this as just another licensing drama, but Matt Larson, coming
back to this, why does this one -- why is this one so special? There was this
cooperation agreement, perhaps we can go into -- is this -- isn't this just another
grand licensing dispute in drag [ph].
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
I think that's -- I think that's a great way, great way of visualizing. It is my view of this
dispute between Apple and Qualcomm in a lawsuit is -- at its core is a patent
licensing litigation. There are antitrust concerns that are unique to Qualcomm, you
think about the international investigations and various ﬁndings out of Korea, out of
Taiwan, there are pending investigations in Japan, there was the NDRC settlements
that set rates and royalty basis for phone makers in China.
So, Apple has a lot of leverage in this dispute, plus you have the way to frame
Qualcomm's licensing as more or less strong arming people or providing a very
strong incentive to buy Qualcomm chips rather than add on a Qualcomm royalty
rate to whatever chips you buy from a third party. And so, Apple is kind of putting
that whole issue into the lawsuit in eﬀect to attempt to negotiate a better deal. I think
the way -- the way that this all plays out and the way that the parties are -- have at
least talked about resolving it for the last of couple years is in some kind of direct
licensing agreement. But in order to get there, Apple is kind of dredging up a lot of
the legal issues surrounding Qualcomm's business to use as leverage in a lawsuit.
(Multiple Speakers)
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
To be frank, we did some -- (Multiple Speakers)
We did some back of the envelope Matt and we came up at in the low two's as a
weighted average handset, royalty that Hon Hai pays Qualcomm. But what's -- is
there any precedent with respect to rates, what's -- what is an acceptable royalty rate
in such a sort of a scenario? Is zero the best rate that Apple is going forward? And
any precedent here would be helpful.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-04-03

Page 7 of 16Matt Larson
Anand Srinivasan
Matt Larson{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
Yeah. There are a couple of decisions to take a look at. As Anand mentioned earlier,
some of this is diﬃcult, because a lot of these royalty rates are set in close door
negotiations. They frequently don't see the light of day, but people in the IT
community kind of know roughly what everyone -- what everyone is paying when
you have a core of maybe ﬁve companies who are all negotiating with one another.
They more or less know what the -- what the oﬀers and pressure points are in the
system.
There have been a few disputes that have boiled over to court decisions where we
get kind of a rationale, where the court goes through at least how the lawyers view
patent licensing. And there you're seeing rates certainly sub 3% of ASP. If you look at
the NDRC settlement where Qualcomm's patent licensing practices on handsets in
China are based on 65% of the net selling price and the rates there worth 5% for 3G,
3.5% for 4G.
Ericsson recently disclosed some of its asking rates in an ongoing lawsuit with TCL.
TCL and Ericsson have been engaged in licensing discussion that boiled over to
litigation over the past couple of years and recently went to trial asking the judge to
set an appropriate FRAND rate for a global license from Ericsson to TCL.
And those are all again licenses for older generation technologies, 2G or kind of sub
1%, and then you get up to -- when you come into the 4G, 4G LTE licenses around,
you're approaching 2% with the cap. It looks like a $4 cap, kind of adjusting for there
are now handsets that are more complicated and again as we move into 5G, they're
going to be interconnected, interconnected cars, wireless devices are no longer
limited to handsets and so the licensing practice is starting to recognize. You don't
get 5% of a catalog that's Wi-Fi enabled router that's got some kind of cellular
functionality. Its cap is based on the value of that functionality to the device. So
there's a lot (Multiple Speakers).
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Actually on that, you know on that speciﬁc ratio Qualcomm actually clariﬁed that they
do not charge royalties based on -- for automobiles is based on the value of the
module that goes into that, that enables that speciﬁc function, but --
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
Exactly, and that argument comes out and there is a line of cases that talks about
what's the appropriate royalty base and there is this dispute between how that
language is interpreted. There is language about the royalty. The appropriate royalty
is the smallest salable unit. And so, Apple commonly interprets that, as well the
smallest salable unit is the chips. So royalty should be based on the chip, whereas
practice in FC and among most companies has been, you know, the royalty base is
the handset, it's not the tiny chip, it's a larger value. So there's a little bit of that legalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-04-03
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 8 of 16Anand Srinivasan
Matt Larson
Anand Srinivasan
Jennifer Rietheme that's playing out here, Apple is trying to minimize royalties and Qualcomm is
obviously trying to get a larger piece of the pie to calculate compensation.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
So, what happens now? What are our next steps? Can you lay out sort of a potential
sequences or timeline roughly?
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
Yeah, sure. So Apple ﬁled its complaints and it looks like Qualcomm will ﬁle
essentially a motion to dismiss challenging not necessarily the ultimate conclusion
that comes out of a lawsuit, but this is just a preliminary motion to winnow down
Apple's complaint. There's a lot of incendiary language, everything that you see in
legal pleadings has to be taken with a grain of salt, because the lawyers are working
hard to present the best case they possibly can, which may look a lot more damning
than it actually is in reality.
So Qualcomm will ﬁle its response to Apple's complaints on April 10th. We'll likely
see a lot of criticism. They'll try to poke holes in Apple's complaint. There will be
brieﬁng back and forth through the summer, and a date hasn't been set, but the
judge will likely hear this preliminary disputes over the scope of what this case is
about in August and we could see the case really starting kind of mid-3Q.
And as a note, these cases take a long time to resolve. If it were just a patent case,
the average patent case takes about 2.5 years in this district in California. So you're
looking for any potential resolution would be end of 2018 at the earliest that the
parties are able to dispose of some of these issues before trial, but likely not until
2019, according to the court's schedule. Again that's absent any kind of out-of-court
settlement if the parties are able to reach. But at this point it looks like they're fairly
far apart in how they're viewing licensing agreements, and yet again noting that this
agreement is going to have a huge impact on how the end of 4G and 5G licenses
are structured.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it. So don't hold your breath is you point. What about you Jen, across -- yeah,
across antitrust, how long is it going to take and how much is it going to cost?
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
Well, timing, as Matt just said, sometimes these antitrust lawsuits generally can take a
very long time to resolve. We have our Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against
Qualcomm, which is sort of related -- the issues are related to those in the Apple
lawsuit that Matt just talked about. It's related to the way that Qualcomm has
licensed its standard essential patents, and a 2007 agreement with Apple. That
lawsuit has -- there is some controversy around that lawsuit right now in the timing,
because it's an FTC lawsuit, and the commissioners vote to bring those suits and atFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-04-03
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 9 of 16Anand Srinivasanthe time they voted, there were three commissioners, and it was a two to one vote,
need to be a majority vote to bring a suit.
One has left and we have two commissioners left, and of the one -- one of the
commissioners left was quite against opposed to bringing the suit. She actually
came out and said that she had seen no robust economic evidence supporting the
fact that Qualcomm's conduct had caused any kind of exclusion or any kind of harm
to the market. So there is a lot of -- the speculation that with just two commissioners
left and the one that is opposed to the suit is now the acting Chairperson, that the
suit could get dropped.
Now, I recently last week was at an ABA Antitrust Conference and this was discussed
a bit. And it seems that several of the speakers there, the experts there felt that that
wouldn't happen, that the suit wouldn't get dropped because it would seem too
political, and that these things have some momentum and once they get going they
don't just get dropped, but they did suggest that because the FTC is prosecuting a
suit that the Chairperson is not backing, that it could mean that they don't really
actively prosecute it. It could mean that they kind of just lamely go through the
emotions and this sort of states away and maybe ends up with some easy settlement,
and so that means could be quicker than these sometimes are.
Now the private suits, which are copycats of that FTC suit which is very common,
they'll take a lot longer. They are seeking monetary damages, the FTC is not looking
for money, they were looking for a change in conduct. The private class action
plaintiﬀs are buyers of mobile phones, handheld devices, tablets, they claim that
they paid an inﬂated price because this higher licensing cost that OEMs was passed
on to them. And they're looking for triple damages for anything that they overpaid
since I believe 2013. So, that will drag on for a long time and I also suspect
Qualcomm will ﬁght that really hard, because especially with Commissioner
Ohlhausen's statement that there was no harm to the market due to Qualcomm's
conduct, these private plaintiﬀs also have to show harm to the market. To sustain an
antitrust case, private plaintiﬀs have to not only show they were harmed, but they
have to show that there was market harm. And if they can't show that there was
market harm, they're done. So, I suspect Qualcomm will ﬁght it, it'll drag out
ultimately probably settle on for an amount that's unlikely to be particularly material.
Timing on EU, again, that's going to drag out. There could be some announcement
about a sign in the next year sooner than later. But in terms of continuing to ﬁght that
and having a ﬁnal resolution, that's way down the road. And the NXPI merger, like I
said before, Qualcomm is estimated they'll be able to close that by the end of 2017. I
think it's a really good estimate, especially if they get their ﬁlings in the EU and China
formalized in the next month, and there seem to be some news, if that is imminent. I
think they have a great chance of getting that close and meeting the deadline.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it. So again to recap, just from an equity analyst perspective not being a lawyer
by trade, 34 private cases consolidated hearing was a couple of days ago and theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-04-03
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 10 of 16Jennifer Rie
Anand Srinivasandecision on that will be in four weeks.
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
Right now, let me just clarify, the hearing is about whether all those cases should be
put into one big case. That's what the hearing is about in front of one judge, in one
court, everybody gets put together. If that happens, that case starts all over again.
They'll ﬁle a new complaint as a consolidated group of plaintiﬀs and that slows
things down even more. That hearing took place March 30th.
The FTC suit -- and I don't mean to interrupt you, but I guess, I should have said this
before, it's quite ahead of that, because in the FTC suit Qualcomm yesterday ﬁled a
motion to dismiss the suit. So, yesterday was a good day for them with that motion
plus the US antitrust clearance and that brieﬁng will continue through June, through
mid-June and there will likely be an argument after that and some decision, so they
could get a decision in that before the end of 2017.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it, got it. And parallel process on the Apple complaint, Qualcomm's response
date too on the Apple complaint is by as Matt Larson just mentioned April 10th, and
August 2017 a preliminary hearing on that subject on whether the Apple case may
proceed. The ruling on that might come mid to late 3Q. Late 2018 is when an early
ruling is possible, but it could drag on well into 2019 on ﬁnal ruling. And of course
there's appeals after that and as Matt mentioned, on average, it takes about 2.5 years
a trial and this one is more complicated. And on the antitrust litigations, again, 2019
and beyond as Jen has mentioned.
You know, we've been on for about 30 minutes or so. We want to pause there and
take questions from the ﬁeld here. And we'll pause a minute or so before we get to
questions here.
The one question just in the meanwhile we're polling and accumulating the
questions is, what happens if Apple doesn't pay in the meanwhile. An interesting
side note to that is, because Hon Hai is the one with the license and not Apple, Hon
Hai's business would be imperiled if it decides not to pay Apple as part of the -- pay
Qualcomm, excuse me, royalties.
And then another question that is often asked is, if a royalty settlement is reached,
we have slides on this, is if you look at the -- we've done some ﬁnancial analysis as to
whether if Apple alone beneﬁted from the royalty rate to Qualcomm in and of itself
Apple reducing royalty rate is a little bit of a hit to Qualcomm's ﬁscal year '18
earnings, but it is not material. But then, the precedent question that it sends is,
won't everyone else wanted. And if you look at that, if it is substantial, if it is
substantial and everybody else can and does partake of it, that's when you have a
substantial hit to the royalty model at Qualcomm. And that's when earnings power
really comes down in ﬁscal '18. That is a scenario that most people are worried about
and justiﬁably so.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-04-03

Jennifer RieBut they've done this in the past with the NDRC when royalty rates were reduced
Qualcomm did in fact appeal or approach all of its customers saying, hey, this is the
deal that we have struck with the NDRC. This is the deal that OEMs in China can
beneﬁt from, which you'll partake in this deal. And in most cases for non-Chinese
handsets, whether the handsets are made in China or not, is not the question,
whether the handsets go out of China, to be used out of China is the question. For
those handsets, a higher royalty rate was applicable from Qualcomm.
So, for global handset OEMs it didn't make a whole lot of sense, for Chinese handset
OEMs that were shipping a lot of product to the non-China regions that didn't make
a lot of sense. So this was -- they were able to contain the fallout if you may and
restricted it to Chinese handset makers that were making product predominantly for
consumption in the China market alone. So, the court ﬁnding in favor of Qualcomm
as I mentioned before, would be the disastrous scenario.
We have a couple of questions. What is the soonest the NXP deal could get done,
could get approval in our opinion?
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
I think the reason that's really hard to estimate is because the wildcard here is
Chinese approval. And part of the reason for that is that in China, a deal like this, a
tech deal not only goes through the Ministry of Commerce which approves the deal
from an antitrust perspective, but it also has to go through one of their ministries that
reviews technology issues and that ministry can be slow and the Ministry of
Commerce is not allowed to clear it until they've heard from this technology group.
And that has slowed down some of our past semiconductor deals.
I would say probably the soonest my guess and this is really a guess and this is
based on how long it took for some other deals to get cleared. I'm guessing that the
soonest could be about nine months from when they announced, and they
announced late October 2016. And the reason I picked that number eight to nine
months is because if you look at Western Digital SanDisk, if you look at Analog
Devices Linear Technology, Intel Altera and the past semi deals in the last two years,
the ones that didn't require divestitures, which is why I suspect it will happen here
took between six and eight to nine months. NXP Freescale took longer, but that is
because both for Europe and US they had to divest radio frequency businesses.
So I think possibly eight to nine months from let's say November 1st, 2016.

{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
End of calendar '17
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
Right. Now, the question -- that now, I think end of calendar '17 is really safe if the
question was when is the soonest. And so I'm saying May -- and also this depends on
Qualcomm because time clocks for these regulators don't start until Qualcomm
formally ﬁled and we know they haven't formally ﬁled in Europe, because once that
happens, the European Union, the European Commission sets up a public docket
and I look for that docket, it has not been set up yet.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it.
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
So, that hasn't happened. It's possible they have formally ﬁled in China, although I
sort of doubt it. I think if they had, they would have said something publicly about it.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you. When will we start seeing whether other Qualcomm licensees will
start to challenge the royalty agreements? What is the timeline for any royalty
schemes changing for Qualcomm and meet these law suits? I want to get Matt
Larson in, but before we do that, remember that Qualcomm has individual contracts
with individual timeframes or terms of licensing agreements and royalty payments
with individual companies. So, for Samsung it has a deal, for Apple -- for Hon Hai it
has a deal, for Vivo, for Oppo, for Lenovo, it has separate deals and these all span
diﬀerent terms. So, unless somebody decides to default on their contract, it's unlikely
that those royalty schemes would change unless there has been a material impact
from a litigation perspective.
And then, Matt Larson, have you seen this before where there is an interim change as
a result of a regulatory review or -- I mean some litigation from another OEM?

Page 13 of 16Anand SrinivasanYeah, yeah. We've deﬁnitely seen that. Let me answer in two parts. Kind of
piggybacking oﬀ of on response for when do people start to renegotiate their rates.
Licenses typically last anywhere from three to seven years. So, thinking about
individual licenses, three to seven years with the skew to a three to ﬁve year term is
typically when these things start to expire. And so for individual licensees, you can --
if it's not explicitly stated, you can guestimate that -- that that's about when these
things come up and you're really negotiating rates probably two years before these
things expire.
And so, licensees were in the midst of renegotiating rates or at least contemplating
how to think about 5G or starting to have these discussions already and the elephant
in the room is going to be this Apple litigation. Those agreements aren't typically
penned or don't take eﬀect until after the prior agreement has expired. And as we've
seen in a number of diﬀerent cases, sometimes there's litigation if the parties can't
agree and an agreements ends, then lawsuits are ﬁled and the parties run to their
most favorable jurisdiction in order to try to get a favorable patent ruling.
We've seen this with Ericsson cases, we've seen it with Nokia, we're starting to see a
couple cases ﬁled against BLU, both the BlackBerry and LG approaching BLU as
because of increased sales, trying to put pressure on in diﬀerent jurisdictions. So
that's -- that's a little bit of a soft answer, but kind of the answer is, based on
individual licenses, maybe three to ﬁve years after the license was signed. And
generally with Apple, people will use that -- use this ongoing litigation as a
negotiating point, but the other shoe drops when there is some kind of
determination or when the parties have exited the litigation.
So, that's really when you have your strongest precedent when you have either a
settlement announced or you have a judicial decision that judge issues something
that you can point to and say, look, here's the legal precedent for how to license this
body of intellectual property. And like I said, I think that, at the very earliest is the end
of 2018 but likely sometime in 2019 when you see a -- the judge put pen to paper
and come out with something that people can use in negotiations.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it. It is interesting that Matt bought timing up in this and that -- why is Apple
doing this now potentially in some of its other actions against imagination as well. If
you look far ahead into 5G potential 2020, 2021 and you back drive from certain
amount of R&D required, integration required, testing required and you come back
to this current timeline that -- and Apple has always been actions rather than words
so far as wanting to make its own chips.
You can see a runway where it wants to take in more and more in-sourcing, the move
from Qualcomm, partially to Intel demonstrates that, so this could all be prep ahead
of the 5G window. So in the 5G timing 2020, 2021, it could be very, very interesting.
So, that's another data point that you might want to consider. When --FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-04-03

Page 14 of 16Matt Larson
Anand SrinivasanSo can you please -- here's another question. Can you please clarify whether
Qualcomm is more negotiating power with OEMs who are making handsets to be
shipped out of China or those that build are sold within China? So if you look at the
NDRC deal, there was a two-part sort of royalty structure. One is made in China,
consumed by China -- by Chinese vendors and then made in China, consumed
elsewhere.
So you could do an a la carte menu of Chinese -- Chinese-based technology or
Chinese-based -- technology needed for in-country in China, plus technology
needed for other regions of the world, add those two royalty together and come out
with a certain block based on volume shipments. And then parallel, you could say,
okay, this is a global handset licensing structure independent of region and you see
which one is lower and you would pick one based on volumes.
Insofar as Qualcomm's negotiating power, I mean to a great degree in math you can
chime in if -- as well, into a great degree, it's based on volume, complexity, ASPs, end
market and how viscerally you want to adopt Qualcomm and not do any business
with any other vendor. Would that be point of thought or do you have any to add
there Matt?
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
Yes, I've got another point to add just on the legal side too. I agree with what Anand
said and layered over that as we're thinking about IP agreements. I think it's worth
noting the IP enforcements -- the IP enforcement going on in China right now. China
over the last couple years has built out specialized intellectual property courts. I'm
kind of recognizing the reputation it had for not enforcing IP, particularly IP
belonging to countries abroad. It set up a series of the specialized courts, the main
one that we hear about is in Beijing and it's got an astronomical win rate for foreign
plaintiﬀs trying to enforce IP in China.
So, you think about for -- and then some of the remedies that that court oﬀers are
blocking the export of goods that are infringing or not licensed from China to the
outside world. And so, in terms of a legal case that gives Qualcomm who kind of
goes to China with NDRC deal and hand a lot more leverage over both companies
who are selling in China, because their products are -- if you win these legal cases or
potentially block from sale, inventories are put on hold, and also it blocks the
shipments of devices to the outside world.
So, in both cases, Qualcomm has a little bit of leverage because of this new legal
trend that we've seen in the enforcement of intellectual property in China. So, kind of
I'll add that to cover Anand's comments.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it. Thanks. And we have another question as it does in the large number of
Chinese licensees calculate on the value of the device, service, strong precedent of
the Apple lawsuit. And the answer is, yes. And remember, that everybody there wasFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-04-03

Page 15 of 16Matt Larson
Anand Srinivasanoﬀered a China NDRC deal, but many of the handset makers they are making
product not only for consumption in China but for consumption overseas. So, the
NDRC doesn't necessarily have the purview to address that.
And then to some degree, and so sort of that limits things a little bit, number one.
Number two, is also if you look at Apple for example, Apple and Samsung were
explicitly from what I understand were oﬀered the NDRC deal everybody was. And
you also -- as a handset OEM, you wanted to limit the number of SKUs so that your
supply chain and your logistics management doesn't run away from you.
So if you look at Apple SKUs, it still has the fewest number of SKUs of any large
handset OEM on the block. If you look at Samsung for example, there's a lot more
variety on the platform, lot more ﬂavors, lot more diversity across price points. If you
look at Apple, for example, it has expanded and the number of ﬂavors in the ice
cream shop if you may have expanded. But it is nowhere near the variety and the
price point diversity that somebody like a Samsung oﬀers.
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
Anand, there is one other point that I'll note too, just in terms of the precedent and
Chinese licensees. If you look at the timeline that Apple lays out and it's complaints
in the Apple-Qualcomm litigation, that the timing of the NDRC settlement
corresponds roughly with oﬀers that Qualcomm made to Apple when attempting to
negotiate a direct license in 2015 and we've done quite well. You can kind of look at,
we've laid those out in parallel. And so there is some suggestion at least that
Qualcomm approached Apple with the numbers there. My take is Apple is currently
getting a better deal, so why take a step back. But that's going to factor fairly heavily
into this dispute.
I think it's -- if you're Qualcomm you have to be feeling good that the NDRC, who at
least is perceived to be a somewhat hostile review to outside forces and might have
some protectionist interests approved a licensing regime that you're now trying to
negotiate with Apple.
So I think that will certainly bare pretty heavily on the dispute with all licensing
disputes, again after we get past this kind of initial stage at the end of the year. If the
case moves on, you will see all kinds of companies being issued subpoenas which is
course -- due course of business and we'll see licensing agreements from other
companies bearing on what this should be happens [ph], I again will reference the
TCL, Ericsson case that went to trial while in February and ended in March. They had
licensing agreements from pretty much everybody in the industry, sort of the judge
to compare and see where these FRAND rates are lining up.
So that's a long answer but short term yeah, I think that the Chinese licenses will bear
pretty heavily in the dispute.
