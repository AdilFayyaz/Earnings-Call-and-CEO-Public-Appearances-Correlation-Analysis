{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. We're pleased to start the next presentation at the
DB Technology Conference. I'm Ross Seymore, Semiconductor Analyst here at DB.
We're very pleased to have Colette Kress, the CFO; as well as Stewart Stecker from
Investor Relations from Nvidia today. Obviously, a very, very exciting day for Nvidia
with its announcement last night of the intention to purchase Arm, and this will be
mainly a ﬁreside chat. If you have any other questions, you can email them to me
within the webcast system or directly at ross.seymore@db.com.
Before we get started in the ﬁreside chat, I want to pass it over to Stewart just to run
through some of the disclosures from the Nvidia side. Stewart?
{BIO 17308457 <GO>}
Great. Thank you, Ross. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements
based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of signiﬁcant risks and
uncertainties, and our actual results may diﬀer materially. For a discussion of factors
that could aﬀect our future ﬁnancial results and business, please refer to our most
recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may ﬁle on Form 8-K with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today,
September 14, 2020 based on information currently available to us. Except as
required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.
With that, I will turn it back over to you, Ross.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Thanks, Stewart. So, Colette, why don't we jump right into the Arm deal, and I have
some strategic questions, some ﬁnancial questions and then some regulatory ones?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14

Q - Ross Seymore
A - Colette KressSo, why don't we start on the strategic side of things? You held an investor call this
morning at 8:30 Eastern Time. But just to go over some of the highlights on that,
what's the strategic vision you guys have for the combination of Nvidia and Arm?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah, absolutely. So, correct, yesterday afternoon was our announcement of our
plans to acquire Arm. This acquisition we believe creates an opportunity to become
the premier computing company for the age of AI. This gives us the combination of
Nvidia's leading AI computing platform along with Arm's vast CPU ecosystem. And it
positions us in the right way for the next wave of computing as we move into the age
of AI.
Our hopes are to expand Arm's IP licensing portfolio with Nvidia's technology into
some of these large end markets that Arm has, including mobile as well as PCs. We
also hope to turbocharge Arm's server CPU roadmap pace and accelerate it into the
data center, edge, AI and IoT opportunity. This gives us the ability to reach even a
larger overall developer community than we have alone. Our developer community,
for example, is about 2 million folks that use CUDA as well as many of our other
platforms for gaming and otherwise. And now, we have the opportunity to address
more than 15 million developers that are on Arm. This deal is ﬁnancially attractive to
us. It has a high margin, reoccurring revenue platform business and we expect at
close for it to be immediately accretive to our non-GAAP EPS and gross margins.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for those details. If we delve a little bit deeper into this, it seems like
you can bring the Arm IP up to a higher level of processing power, servers, data
center, that sort of thing. And then as you said, you can bring the Nvidia IP down to
the broader market of mobile devices, et cetera. How do you envision the Nvidia IP
going into those mobile devices? If I go back into the past, you had an IP licensing
model to a certain extent, it was much more narrowly focused with Intel at one point
and then I believe you tried to do a licensing model after the Intel deal ran its course.
So, talk a little bit about how you plan to bring that Nvidia IP to market via this Arm
acquisition?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, that's exactly our plans and focusing on Arm's IP portfolio, which is broad,
probably one of the broadest ones out there in the market. They have the focus in
terms of licensing their architectures, licensing their cores, which comes back as
overall royalties. The overall devices, IoT devices, phones or other way that have
been sold or in market is probably a market of more than 180 billion. And per year,
there's about 20 billion devices and such that are overall licensed with overall Arm.
But what is unique is Nvidia has the world's best GPU technology and something
that the billions of mobile users can likely beneﬁt from.
So, right now, they have overall mobile compute capabilities and now we have the
ability to both still provide availability to their existing overall GPU for mobile, but
now add an additional overall licensing technology with our overall GPU technology.
This can be things that can assist in terms of AR, VR, gaming, AI, there is a huge setsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 11Q - Ross Seymore
A - Colette Kress
Q - Ross Seymore
A - Colette Kressof opportunities out there, even working with the overall data centers to add this as
well.
Now, we had tried in the past working on licensing our technology, but we know that
Arm has a tremendous leadership in being able to package up what is necessary to
serve this overall market. There's a lot of work in terms of supporting that
infrastructure once you start licensing it and making the instruction set are usable
and easy to work through. So, our focus is going to now be taking that expertise of
Arm together with us. It's not that we don't think there is an opportunity, but there
was certainly a opportunity here to use Arm to help us get to market, and that's
where our focus is going to be after we close this deal.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
So, strategically, do you see the beneﬁt of this being more the ability to combine the
IP and oﬀer it as one bundle more like the Arm business model or taking what Arm
brings and allowing it to accelerate Nvidia's ability to deliver actual silicon with that
IP, which direction do you think is most beneﬁcial or is it actually both?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Well, stepping back, this isn't about a bundling situation, this isn't about that, this is
really knowing that Arm already has a great following for the architecture and the
license cores that they provide and we can provide another option to overall
customers in expanding their choice of what would be available through that. So,
you're right, it can go multiple diﬀerent ways. That says, what is the overall customer
needing, is the customer needing the overall architecture and an opportunity to
develop their own, customize their own and take a chip to overall manufacturing, do
they need the overall license cores already built out and what kind of capabilities do
they want in those overall cores or do they want something that is completely
already taped out, completed overall chip that they can put in times of their systems
or our systems together. So, you're right, the optionality there is a both, there is many
diﬀerent types of solutions that can be brought together with Nvidia and Arm.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
If we think -- and maybe this is the last strategic question, if we think about this asset
historically, even before it was sold to SoftBank, it appeared to be one that most
believed could not be owned by another merchant silicon provider because of the
inherent conﬂict of interest that would be perceived for anybody that wanted to
license from Arm and then could potentially be competing against the owner of this
architecture. How do you get around that either real or perceived conﬂict of interest?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
When you think about what Arm and Nvidia are as a foundation of companies, both
companies are quite an overall open company and overall agnostic to their overall
ecosystem and relatively neutral overall in terms of how they support their overall
markets. For example, Nvidia supports each and every overall CPU that is in market
today, whether that'd be x86, whether that'd be Power or any other such as Arm and
our work that we've been doing with Arm. So, very similar in that manner of bothFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 11Q - Ross Seymore
A - Colette Kressbeing quite neutral to their ecosystems and being able to provide their products
overall.
The best things both of our companies want to do is make sure that they integrate
into all of these diﬀerent platforms that are out there and creating platforms together
for the next generation of AI or something in terms of energy eﬃciency, like Arm
does. So, we believe that Arm and Nvidia are actually quite complementary in total.
We believe when we articulate well to our -- both customers that we have as well as
the customers that Arm has, they will truly see the beneﬁts that the two companies
can now do working together.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
So, why don't we pivot over a little bit to the regulatory concerns on this. I think much
like that potential conﬂict of interest dynamic that plays into the regulatory concerns
as well, it sounds like you've had customer conversations already, Jensen mentioned
on the call this morning that Simon had already talked to a bunch of the customers.
When you think about the regulatory environment, ﬁrst, it sounds like an 18-month
close, which is at least six months longer than the average deal to close. So, it's --
that seems to endorse that you believe it will be complex, whether it's because of
the structure of the deal or the sheer size of the deal. But more importantly than that
when you think about customers and competitors on one side or the governments
trying to ensure employment and those sorts of things in their given regions, which
side do you think is more complex to get this deal done? And how have you
engaged with both of those sides, the customers and competitors and then the
government side, to get to the point where you were willing to announce this deal
last night?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. So, let's ﬁrst start with the overall regulatory side of this deal. We expect to go
and get regulatory approval beginning in the US, probably the EU, the UK and
probably overall China. As you know, we have most recently been through that
regulatory approval process as we've worked on Mellanox and we're very familiar
both with the regulatory teams in each of these jurisdictions, their process and we've
actually learned a lot. And I think they have learned a lot about Nvidia during that
process as well. So, we believe that, yes, likely under 18 months and sometimes a
little bit similar to what we have seen when we did Mellanox. And I think we're
basing that based on the work that we did through that overall deal. Mellanox did
work on a lot of the data center business. This is a little bit of a larger scope because
there's many diﬀerent overall markets and that is why we've probably added a
couple of more months versus how long it took us to overall ﬁnish the Mellanox
acquisition.
When we think about that regulatory approval, it is really about assuring the
availability to customers today and maintaining the overall competition in the market
as we go forward. So, when we talk about the complementary mess of overall Arm
and Nvidia as well as our plan to commit to the Arm's existing licensing model and
essentially preserve Arm's customer neutrality, I think the overall regulatory process
will move through quite well. We believe the deal in total is pretty much pro-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 11Q - Ross Seymore
A - Colette Kresscompetitive in terms of what we have outlined. Nor do we think it will aﬀect any
customer and/or any country' access to overall Arm's technology.
So, the second part of the question was really talking about the diﬀerent jurisdictions
around the world and focusing on areas such as the UK. The UK is the overall home
of Arm right now. They are based in overall Cambridge. And if you saw in terms of
our announcement, we truly want to keep that as their home in terms of where they
have developed this technology for over 30 years and where so much of their RP is
based. But we believe we can help them and add to what they already have there in
the market, focusing on that next wave of AI.
Our plans are to build a AI center in Cambridge, like they're in their home and add
to it a set of high top overall researchers that we can have from the overall
Cambridge area, Cambridge University and focus on building a supercomputer to
build out some of their work that they are also doing in the data center to bring a
CPU to such an important workload. So, I think we are focused not only on the
jurisdictions, we are focused on the needs of providing the neutrality, the
competitiveness and the access that each of all these regions and customers may
need.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Thanks for all that color, Colette. Why don't we wrap up the Nvidia-Arm discussion
with a couple of ﬁnancial related questions. I believe in the press release and the
slide deck, you said that in the last 12 months ending in March, this asset had about
$1.8 billion in revenue, 94% pro forma gross margin and about 35% adjusted EBITDA
margins. As we look forward on the revenue side of things, we talked earlier about
bringing the Nvidia IP to kind of the more mobile end of the spectrum and the Arm
IP up to the more data center and server end of the spectrum. Can you talk about
the revenue growth assumptions and/or the vision you have for what the revenue
growth can look like for this company?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So, that is correct. In terms of what we are purchasing, we are purchasing the overall
IPG business of Arm. What will remain with SoftBank is the ISG business, which they
have announced earlier of an area to bring to them and potentially sell that overall
business. But what we are focused on is the high quality business, the high gross
margin and that reoccurring revenue platform that comes with the IPG business of
Arm.
What we believe is we have a great opportunity to expand into the current markets
that they actually are working today, mobile, data center, infrastructure, automotive
and IoT by the instruction of our focus of our technology and being able to license
our technology into that market, but we also see an opportunity in working on new
projects, addressing markets in the data center and turbocharging the work that has
been done there to expand into that business as well. So, it's a little early to talk
about what size overall growth that is, but it can beneﬁt I think both sides in terms of
growing the markets that each of us are in.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14

Q - Ross Seymore{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
And then you mentioned about turbocharging Arm's investment, given Nvidia's
greater R&D capacity, I think a lot of that was targeted towards the data center side
of things, but it could be a broader statement overall as well. How do you think
about the proﬁtability, that 35% number you're looking at, as you're turbocharging
that, is that something where the OpEx is going to rise? How does that relate to the
revenue? Any sort of target proﬁtability or kind of roadmap on the proﬁtability side
of things would be helpful as well.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. I believe the business of Arm, the IPG business is continuing to improve their
overall ﬁnancial metrics, both their margins as well as the overall revenue on the top
line. So, even through the overall 18 months, I think we'll see them actually improve
through that period. I think the investments are really helping them build the
opportunities in terms of the top line, and I think both of those things driven
together could have an improvement in the margins over time. There could be a
possibility of getting back to higher margins, some of the ones that we had seen
back in the 2016 time before they went private working for SoftBank.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Great. And then the last question on this is -- actually two ﬁnal questions. I'm not sure
you're going to answer either of them, but I got to give it a shot anyway. When you
talk about the gross margin accretion upon the conclusion of the deal, I think
everybody gets that at face value. The EPS accretion seems like it's a little more
complex potentially. Are there any signiﬁcant revenue growth and/or margin
expansion assumptions behind there? If you're not willing to give any speciﬁc
numbers, which I suspect you're not, any sort of assumptions being more dependent
on one side versus the other, the revenues versus the margins?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
No. There's no speciﬁcs on there. Again, the business will likely continue to grow
between now and the overall close of the acquisition, which can be accretive. We're
buying a business that is proﬁtable right oﬀ the bat and I think that will help our
overall EPS. And you're correct, the gross margin is an easy piece because it is
mostly software. And that does absolutely turn to be positive gross margins versus
where our corporate company averages.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for all that color, Colette. Why don't we give you an actual break from
talking about the deal today, which I suspect you're going to continue to do after
you and I are done chatting and let's go over to diﬀerent parts of your business and
pivot speciﬁcally to the gaming side of the equation here. You just announced a
week or two ago the RTX 3000 family, the Ampere 7-nanometer or 8-nanometer, I
guess, in this case based on Samsung. Talk a little bit about that launch. It seems that
performance beneﬁts are quite enormous, but the strategy on the go-to-market side
seems to be a little less about the pricing side than the Turing generation or theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 11A - Colette KressPascal generation and much more about performance and seemingly going for unit
growth. So, talk a little bit about the technology beneﬁts that you're delivering and
then the pricing and growth targets that you have strategically for the RTX family?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So, Arm has certainly been exciting over the last 24 hours, but we can't forget
our exciting launch of our Ampere architecture for gaming as well. Our GeForce RTX
30 series, the GeForce RTX 30 series is probably one of our biggest generational
leap in gaming that we have had. It is 2x the performance improvement versus
Turing and it is 1.9x the power eﬃciency that we have with overall Turing. A
unbelievably compelling lineup kicks oﬀ our Ampere architecture product cycle in
gaming. This will be our second generation of RTX, our real-time ray tracing, which
extends our overall leadership in ray tracing with GeForce. It also has 2x the
performance that I think you referred to with the overall same price bands or overall
price points. This is also our second generation of our RT cores with 2x the
throughput versus the previous generation and it's our third generation of our
Tensor cores with over 2x the throughput over the previous generations.
So, your statement regarding given that the performance is increasing quite strongly
with the overall price points, what can we expect in terms of both the units or is there
also an ASP position in here. So, focusing in terms of the growth of the market and
the ability to attract both a refresh of their existing overall desktops and/or PCs is
deﬁnitely an opportunity as well as attracting new overall gamers to this market.
Right now, this has become one of the most important entertainment mediums that
are out there. A lot of this has been inﬂuenced by a change, which may just be the
new norm going forward. Many of us are looking for live overall entertainment as we
work from our homes, as we teach from our homes and therefore play from our
homes or game from our home. And a lot of that has inﬂuenced the excitement that
this new generation of cards will provide.
The second thing that is very key in terms of why people are coming to the market
are the new games coming to the market. Not only did we launch the overall
Ampere architecture, we also launched a signiﬁcant amount of software that will help
inﬂuence that gaming experience, the gaming experience whether or not you are
just a normal gamer and we have new games coming to market using our ray trace
technology and/or our DLSS improving with AI that ray tracing experience or you're
a broadcaster and looking for keys on how to better represent your work in terms of
gaming on the web. So, so many diﬀerent things to bring people into the market
right now to buy gaming.
The price points though are an opportunity for us to continue to raise the bar of that
entry level and/or your refresh on where do you want to game at. So, for example,
we're really looking about our overall average ASPs for overall gaming. In the past,
we've had some volume SKUs, volume SKUs that are very important around the
world that allows whether they be ﬁrst entrants or refreshers that are common for
them to both get access to ray tracing at what their overall aﬀordability. But what's
been interesting is our top overall performance cards has taken up quite nicely
because of the performance and the increased content that we have in terms of with
ray tracing. So, we expect probably an increase in the mix of the types of cards thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 11Q - Ross Seymore
A - Colette Kresspeople are buying and towards the overall higher end. With that, we can also
continue to have an increase in average ASPs also inﬂuenced by the increase in units
from new users as well as those that are refreshing.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
That's very helpful. You mentioned in answering that a little bit about potentially a
structural or secular change to the consumption of gaming in general during the
unfortunate COVID pandemic, but I guess there can be some upsides from the
gaming side for you guys. About a year ago, you had talked about the base business
for gaming at Nvidia being about $1.4 billion a quarter. You then upsided that, did
about $1.65 billion, you're there now and now you're guiding to a little over $2
billion. If we think about that increase, about 25% year-over-year or even more
versus that $1.4 billion base that you talked about a year ago. What do you attribute
the upside to? And how much of that do you believe is sustainable versus some sort
of COVID-related pull in that is nice for now, but might actually not persist going
forward?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. So, it's amazing what a year can do in terms of changing so many things here
on the planet. So, for one thing, yes, our baseline business and the pieces of growth
that we've seen continues to just both change the overall market, but better overall
expand the overall market for gaming. So, keep in mind, we have three diﬀerent
overall platforms within our gaming business. We have our overall desktop platform,
which we sell cards to our AIC, our add-in-card manufacturers and they put them in
the market either through retail or e-tail.
Our second overall market is our notebook business. Our notebook business is
currently a very important business, where OEM manufacturers have concentrated in
bringing high-end laptops to market for speciﬁcally gaming. And with that, bringing
that thin and light and the high-performance business that we can provide.
Additionally, we have our overall consoles, and our consoles are focused on our
Nintendo partner and they are doing quite well with their overall Switch that has
been market -- have been in market for some time.
Now, what is interesting is the mix just keeps changing within that business. So, yes,
during COVID, there were some changes. The access to the overall retail market at
the very beginning of COVID was shut down and things had to move towards what
we saw in an e-tail market. We were able to swiftly move with our manufacturers to
the e-tail market to address the overall demand that was there. The demand was
about working from home, it was about playing from home, it was about teaching
from home, but it also was aligned to what we've been seeing over several years that
gaming has become an entertainment sport. It is not just about playing the game
and winning the game, it is about the overall conversation with your friends, the
collaboration with your friends and the connections that gaming provides. We do
believe that in this world, everybody will become a gamer at some point.
So, we've seen a shift in terms of COVID, in terms of how those things happened.
Yes, we have seen a very interest in this entertainment area, but I think this is just aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 11Q - Ross Seymore
A - Colette Kress
Q - Ross Seymorecontinuation that we'll see from now until we get to a new norm. We have a big
overall holiday season in front of us, a big holiday season which is fueled with new
games coming to market, new games, many of them also focused on ray tracing as
this is also the time where overall consoles will endorse overall ray tracing.
Our two-year head start on overall ray tracing can be extremely helpful as we look at
the overall holiday market in front of us. This is a time where gamers are in market to
buy games and our two years still puts us with one of the top overall GPU
technology to really enhance overall real-time ray tracing, not only with the
hardware, but with the software. So, overall, yes, there have been a lot of shifts
associated with COVID, but more importantly, I think there's just been a shift of
gaming to an entertainment medium.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Last question for you on the gaming side of the equation is competition. It doesn't
sound like the pricing decisions that you made for Ampere had anything to do with
competition, but with both Intel coming and not only on an integrated basis, but
next year on a discrete basis and AMD launching new higher-end parts within its
stack, how do you view the competitive landscape within discrete and notebook
GPUs and is it changing at all as you look into the back half of this year?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
When you look at either of those two markets, whether it'd be desktop and
notebook, we have quite a good hold on the market of gamers. Gamers love our
brand. They love our overall working with the ecosystem and all of the in --
technology innovation that we seem to bring to the market each and every single
time. Our overall 30 series of GeForce that has come to market couldn't have been a
better launch, it is going quite well. The reviews are solid. The excitement is even
better. So, we're really excited for this gaming holiday, this gaming holiday with the
games.
Games are not necessarily written speciﬁc to a platform, games are written so that
they can reach as far as they can to all of the diﬀerent platforms. So, we're well
positioned with our overall gaming cards that is really bringing ray tracing and ray
tracing that has then continued to improve since the very ﬁrst day that we
announced ray tracing to play those types of games. So, we're excited for this
upcoming market in front of us. It's going to be a great holiday season.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
So, why don't we in the last ﬁve minutes that we have pivot over to the data center
market, which I think this is the ﬁrst time that the data center market has ever only
been worthy over the last ﬁve minutes, it shows how much other excitements you
have going on. Talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the end market. There is a
relatively active debate about the risk of entering another digestion mode amongst
the cloud players. The last time that happened in late calendar '18 and early '19, it hit
pretty ubiquitously across the industry, even Nvidia who has great secular tailwinds
had a little bit of a pause, temporary as it might have been. So, talk about how you're
seeing demand going right now from the aggregate cloud customer base of yours.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14

Page 10 of 11A - Colette Kress
Q - Ross Seymore{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. So, it sounds like we've done a lot of announcements. We've done the
announcement that we plan to purchase Arm. We went back a couple of weeks and
we announced GeForce 30 series, but keep in mind we've also just recently brought
out our Ampere for the data center with our A100. So, we are in the early stages of
ramping our A100 architecture for the overall data center. We've probably had a
quarter, quarter and a half of results there.
We began that work while working with our hyperscales in the A100 rollout. It was
one of the fastest rollouts and speed in terms of getting cloud instances up and
running. Google was able to get their cloud instances up in about a month and
we've now seen overall Microsoft also up in availability. So, we're in a great position
with overall A100 and it's roll out. Next to come is focusing on server manufacturers
that have designed and ready to go 50 diﬀerent designs incorporating A100. This is
an ability for those to both have the overall hyperscales, but also the enterprise and
the enterprise verticals out there to absorb overall A100.
Now, A100 and its launch is diﬀerent and our overall work over the last several years
has been a true test to both understanding the market, our customers and their
needs and it inﬂuenced in terms of how we went to market this time. Went to market
as we have a breadth and depth of overall customers that both are aiding in terms of
the work that they are doing to deﬁne their projects to ﬁnd the overall products that
they may need to support the projects that they're doing.
That connection from an engineering standpoint, our assistance in determining the
products that would be best for the completion of the projects has really helped
inﬂuence our both visibility and working together with each and one of our partners
as well as customers in this market. We've provided over the last couple of quarters
previously our overall visibility for the next quarter, and this is enough of a case in
terms of our visibility with our overall Q3 data center revenue and our plans.
We will be up sequentially and we will be up strongly versus a year ago, probably
150% from a year ago with the combination of Nvidia compute as well as Mellanox
and it's networking. So, we will continue and strive to keep those relationships with
the customers, so that we can help them plan eﬀectively and us to plan eﬀectively in
terms of meeting their needs, and I think that is where our focus is. From time to
times, projects certainly can be volatile and diﬀerent, but right now, our visibility for
the quarter that we're in is what we're providing.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Well, Colette, that's a perfect answer and a great way to wrap it up. We are exactly on
time. So, thank you so much for taking the time today to attend our conference and
chat with me. I know it's been a very busy and exciting couple of days for you, and
it's probably going to continue for a few more, but we appreciate your time. So,
everyone, that wraps up our ﬁreside chat with Colette Kress and Stewart from Nvidia.
