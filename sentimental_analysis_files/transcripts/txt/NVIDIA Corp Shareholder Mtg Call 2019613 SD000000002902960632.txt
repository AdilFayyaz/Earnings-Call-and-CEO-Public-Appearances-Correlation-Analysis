Presentation
Okay. All right. Great. So I think we're very excited to have Colette Kress, who is the
CFO of NVIDIA, for a ﬁreside chat. I'm going to -- I have a bunch of questions that I
want to go through. And I'm going to hope to leave a couple of minutes at the end
to see -- in the event that there's questions from the audience.
So Colette has been with the company for six years as the CFO and previously at
Cisco, Microsoft and Texas Instruments. So Colette, do you want to start oﬀ with any
introductory comments or do you want me to just start asking you about China right
away?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So let me set the stage a little bit more than just maybe 1 country and let's talk about
-- a little bit more. So listen, we've got a really broad portfolio. A lot of things exciting
are happening outside of the overall ﬁnancial markets.
In terms of we're busy working, our gaming business, the start of overall ray tracing
is deﬁnitely taking oﬀ. We can talk about that a little bit more. Our data center
business, although still a little bit cloudy outside, we're making great progress in
terms of inferencing as well in terms of some of the next phases of our overall AI
focused on conversational AI and we can talk about that. And our automotive
engagements couldn't be stronger in terms of the work that we're doing, everything
from their simulation, their development from Level 2 all the way to Level 5. But we
can talk about...
Questions And Answers
Excellent. We're going to talk about all of those things. But to start oﬀ, I've had
probably 20-some meetings this week and the ﬁrst question for me is what's goingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-13

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Colette M. Kresson in China? How should we manage the risk? What is your -- I know you're getting
that question too. So what do you tell investors on that question? What's your
exposure, how to think about it?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. To think about -- I wouldn't look at it as our exposure. China is -- what I look at is
a very important customer for us. We have been -- with many of the regions of the
world, have a great share of the overall gaming market and China is probably about
1/3 of our overall business in the Asia-Pac area. And when we think about our overall
data center, we've indicated that we work across the globe with all of the diﬀerent
hyperscales. Some of those hyperscales are also in China. Our hyperscales in the
U.S. are deﬁnitely larger overall checkbooks in terms of their CapEx and their overall
purchasing. But China, again, is important person in terms of the work that they do
there. Other parts of our business, not so much in terms of in automotive, maybe in
terms of in the future. But the other ones also have some piece of it.
Okay. Fair enough. I think you guys have taken a particularly strategic approach to
the industry and I want to kind of touch on some of those strategies. One of them is
this idea of being a platform company versus a chip company. And I think a lot of
people are starting to understand that software is a larger part of your value
proposition. Can you -- but more recently, you've been kind of expanding and it
seems like you're kind of delivering a whole system solution. So could you maybe
tease this out a little bit, how to think about NVIDIA as a platform versus a chip
company? What percentage of your revenues are just purely from chips versus chips
and software and systems?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So deﬁnitely over the last 5 to 10 years, we have worked on that transformation,
thinking of the full -- both board approach in terms of what we're doing. But now
much more considerably on the full systems. Systems require thinking about all the
other diﬀerent components and the overall computing architecture. But a key part of
that is software. In our overall gaming business, software is still a very important
piece. We sell the overall boards that go in terms of in desktops. We work in terms of
the chip designs within the notebooks with the overall OEMs. But the software is very
key in terms of developing the ecosystem and developing the content that they play
the games with.
But then if you move towards what we're doing in the enterprise, starting with overall
Quadro line focusing both on RTX and focusing on the next generation of rendering,
software has become a very, very key component. We have taken that business not
just focused on Quadro desktops. But the mobility capability, adding ray tracing.
Now you also see ray tracing servers, rendering servers that will also be available
later this year.
Moving to the data center. This is where we have such a signiﬁcant amount of work
in terms of leveraging our software platform that we've been working on for more
than 10 years and focused on CUDA and it branched oﬀ in terms of being able forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-13

A - Colette M. Kressthe many to create the overall AI frameworks that are so important to the AI wave
that we see. But our systems are becoming very material part of our overall business,
focusing on DGXs. But also focusing with the OEMs as they design out their servers,
not just a slot for the overall GPU. But thinking about all of the diﬀerent components
and how they're linked together. You can even think about our acquisition of the
future with overall Mellanox and the importance of that driving more of the compute
architecture and what can be done exclusively with the nodes. But also looking at the
interconnects and how important that networking layer to accelerated computing
will be in the future.
And so on the topic of Mellanox, can you just remind everybody where we are in the
approval process and what needs to happen in order to get that deal closed?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. We are progressing through the overall approval process. We do have
regulatory approval in the U.S. We have completed our ﬁling within China. We have
a couple of small other regulatory approval areas. And we are still on track to believe
we'll be able to close this deal by the end of December.
Okay. Fair enough. And if you look at the proﬁtability of NVIDIA over the last ﬁve
years or so, it really has improved markedly. Would you attribute that to the systems
approach that you're taking?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
There are so many diﬀerent reasons for the overall growth and proﬁtability over this.
The advancements that we have done in terms of looking at just diﬀerent platforms
within the computing world to apply the overall GPU technology. The overall GPU
technology, beginning in the overall PC, transforming that to be leveraged in the
data center and then balancing our work in the data center to be able to provide
that to edge computing as well as we think about the importance of autonomous
driving has been such a large importance. But the key thing is each of those
expansions and platforms, we have maintained a consistent overall software across
each and every single one of our overall designs that we have.
So essentially, the software package is universal across. There are diﬀerent libraries,
diﬀerent components for the diﬀerent markets that we're doing but the software is
consistent. We're agnostic to any of the diﬀerent types of components in these
platforms. Whether it be diﬀerent operating systems, diﬀerent OEMs, diﬀerent
ODMs, diﬀerent parts of the world, we've been able to use our GPU universal in that
manner.
All of these have really driven our overall expansion as well as the importance of the
software because it's one thing to have a leadership position in the technology and
the overall hardware of the GPU from both the performance and performance
eﬃciency standpoint but the software allows the expansion of the use cases, theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-13

the enterprise as well as what we're seeing in the data center.
Right. It seems to me that, that approach makes your products stickier with your
clients. Is that fair?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Stickier, absolutely. It's a decision that they make when they choose to use NVIDIA,
that they know that the help is there from an overall programming. If it is not
available in the market or if it is a new type of workload, they know it is very easy to
both use overall CUDA to advance with all of the diﬀerent libraries that we've
created as well as just the help that NVIDIA will provide them along the way in terms
of building out the workloads or new types of works that they want to do.
I want to touch on the online -- your online gaming strategy. You -- I think most
investors and gamers think of you as the high-end PC gaming platform. But it seems
like we're starting to grow the market on the online gaming side. And your GeForce
NOW solution, it seems like there's a diﬀerent business model than what investors
are normally used to where you are perhaps sharing in the CapEx and sharing on the
revenue size. So can you clarify the model on GeForce NOW? How should we think
about that?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. The overall expansion of the gaming market has been phenomenal in the last
ﬁve years. You've really seen gaming move to an entertainment overall sport, a
overall socialization platform for people to stay connected with their friends. What
that has evolved is yes, we still are the king of the overall high-end overall gaming on
the most popular platform, which is the PC platform. We have advanced from the
desktop in terms of a mobile capability also with the notebooks. But now we are also
addressing what we see is the future of possibly streaming overall market for games.
Now it's a diﬀerent type of business model. It's a diﬀerent type of overall capability
that we need to provide to the overall gamer. There will still always be that high-end
desktop conﬁguration. It's important to the AAA games. It's important to the overall -
- top overall gamers in the world. But the streaming allows us to expand the market,
expand to gamers that either have chosen not to have a dedicated machine for
gaming or haven't actually been able to do high-end gaming because they chose a
suboptimal PC.
Likewise, thinking about our overall Mac users, a lot of games aren't readily available
for the overall Mac and now streaming gets on the option. So we're approaching the
market in multiple ways. But one of the ﬁrst ways is focused on the telcos. The telcos
have a great access to many of those overall consumers and have the overall ability
to bundle the overall streaming gaming with many of the other services that they
provide their overall customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-13

Page 5 of 10Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Colette M. KressNow the business model in this case is we're helping them develop their overall data
center, which they are readying for overall 5G and putting in overall data center
capabilities using GPUs and then working in terms of a share model with what they
will provide to the overall streamers. A great model. We have this currently on track
with overall Softbank and LGU+. So we're really excited about that, with many others
lined up in the overall pipeline for us to consider.
Our GeForce NOW is a great option for what we think about the overall game
developers that develop the content. It is important that we both work on key
innovations to drive this market. We've worked on building and adding ray tracing,
adding now the overall capability of streaming. But allowing them to maintain the
revenue that they well deserve for the games that they're bringing into market. So
this is essentially renting an overall PC in the cloud. It's not about taking that overall
game revenue away from the overall game builders. So we're really excited about
both of these options and the increasing expansion of the overall gaming market to
the many out there that just maybe have not had the chance to realize the fun of it.
So just to be clear, you are of the view this expands the market, it does not
cannibalize your existing market?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Deﬁnitely in the near term, it is an absolute expansion of the market. There are many
people that would just like the opportunity to continue gaming anywhere and there's
a large amount of them that have not had access to gaming at all.
Fair enough. And last strategy question here. On the earnings call, Jensen said that
NVIDIA is not an accelerator company, it's an accelerated computing company.
What's the message for us there? What does that mean?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So an accelerator is necessary, given the overall end of Moore's law. We're
looking at how are we going to expand computing eﬃciently in the future given the
slowdown of Moore's law. The use of an accelerator has always been an option in
this case and have been around for some time. We still own a signiﬁcant percentage
of the accelerator overall market. And accelerated means something that is added
on top of the general purpose overall compute. But often an accelerator is limiting.
An accelerator rarely has the overall programming capabilities, rarely has the overall
software stack in order to enhance other types of components in the underlying
platform.
When you think about where we're focused on with our overall GPUs and overall
future Mellanox acquisition, we're thinking about the entire compute platform. We're
thinking about how accelerating all levels of what we can do in that platform from
the networking level as well as all of the intersects that may happen between theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-13

A - Colette M. Kresssoftware, the networking, the CPU. So the accelerated computing has to think about
all of these things jointly together in terms of what we're adding.
Okay. That's helpful. So let's go through some of the opportunities you originally
were talking about. On the gaming side. So this last quarter, the gaming increased
by 11% sequentially, declined 39% year-over-year. To what extent is that 39% decline
on a year-over-year basis crypto versus inventories and pure gaming cards? And
since we're -- you're now -- you bounce sequentially up, does that mean that we're --
the inventory issues are behind us?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So we do have the growth sequentially. We believe we're back on to a
sequential growth and we do think this will continue throughout the year. Our prior
year deﬁnitely was inﬂuenced by the availability of overall crypto, the possibility of
using overall GPU cards. So essentially, it was just a very diﬃcult comp for us to
overcome. The inventory -- excess inventory, we believe, for the most part is pretty
much behind us. We believe we're now able to concentrate on our full stack of
Turing that is now available in the market, focus on the great capabilities of ray
tracing that, that begins. And we believe our hopes of normalization of our overall
business will be occurring somewhere between Q2 and Q3.
Okay. Excellent. Gaming notebooks have been growing. And you talked about your
Max-Q gaming notebooks. What is Max-Q? What is the opportunity here?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. Max-Q is a great design that we worked with, with our overall OEMs worldwide
because we realized that gamers wanted to be mobile. But they were not willing to
go backwards and give up their thin and light. They wanted thin and light and they
wanted high performance at the same time. And so we worked with the design with
the OEMs incorporating, which we call Max-Q. We have now launched since CES
probably more than 120 diﬀerent laptops of high-end gaming capabilities. But also
bringing ray tracing both to the consumer, the prosumer as well as the enterprise
capabilities. These are important leading-edge, very great gaming notebooks at just
the same great performance that you would see in our high-end desktops as well.
Okay. Then the other opportunity seems to be ray tracing. Where are -- how
important is ray tracing? Where are we in the -- on the games that are available? And
I saw a press release from you guys on this topic this week, I think. So bring us up to
speed on ray tracing.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. Ray tracing, we believe, will be essential for the next generation of gaming. It is a
distinguished piece of architecture and capabilities that allows things to look nearFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-13

Page 7 of 10Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantreal, no longer simulating the capabilities of ray tracing and the physics behind it but
actually doing it in real time. All of our Turing cards starting well into about the $300
price point or lower can absolutely use overall ray tracing.
We announced many new games starting back in the late fall. But even in this last 1.5
weeks through Computex, through E3, we probably have nearly half a dozen new
games, including Call of Duty, Cyberpunk and a couple other really great games
coming out. We have the endorsement of the ecosystem, all the game engines that
are out there, that are building as well as the APIs for Microsoft and others to begin
the entire ecosystem focused on ray tracing. We are the hardware platform now that
is only focused on overall ray tracing. So we're really pleased about the ongoing
excitement that has been brought with ray tracing.
Okay. Let's shift over to the data center, declined by 10% year-over-year, by 7%
sequentially. I think every company that sells into the data center saw great growth
last year and more recently, some declines. And I think most companies believe that
there's a digestion period that's going on in the data center. Can you talk about what
is the visibility like today in the data center? And can you describe the order process
or the forecasting process for data center? Are your customers pinging you? Are
they asking about lead times? Do they give you visibility into programs that they're
going to have in the back half of the year? Can you just shine a little light on that
process for us?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So at the latter half of 2018, there was a signiﬁcant amount of purchase,
worldwide hyperscales and others associated with the overall data center. Probably
what I would refer to is a little bit too much. So what we saw, once we turned that
corner into 2019, saw the ﬁrst month of January, we feel there was a lot of replanning
that was occurring across the world in terms of how much will they be purchasing in
terms of this year. That replanning took a good portion of the First Quarter. And so
as we've moved into now the Second Quarter, still a little cloudy in terms of what we
see into the data center. But we do believe the second half will be a stronger second
half as they will return to overall purchasing.
Our conﬁdence relies on our overall engagement at the engineering level. We have
several ongoing engagements at all times across the board, whether that be with
hyperscales, whether that be with consumer Internet companies or several
enterprises as they think about the use of GPUs on a broad possible uses, from
training to inferencing, in terms of machine learning with our overall data science. So
a signiﬁcant amount of work is there that leaves us with the overall conﬁdence. We
don't have a case where the order processing is a PO. But we're going to use those
engagements at the engineering as they have proven to be very timely in terms of
when we think about the ordering that will happen with the customers.
The inference market was a bright spot for you in data center. It was up sequentially.
It was up year-over-year. And you talked about your T4 product here. What is -- howFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-13

Page 8 of 10A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Colette M. Kressbig is inferencing? And what's the opportunity?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So the inferencing is an enormous opportunity worldwide. It's generally been a CPU
industry for quite some time. And however, what we're seeing is the overall
inferencing workload changed quite a bit. It is much more advanced, many more
diﬀerent types of algorithms that transpired during that inferencing process. You are
seeing inferencing at the edge. You are seeing inferencing at the enterprise levels to
even think about the overall machine learning.
So what we are working on is continuing to establish the overall GPUs that are
engineered speciﬁcally for inferencing. You saw our release of our overall T4. It went
to Google's cloud ﬁrst. It is now getting broadly adopted and becoming an
important part of our data center business. It has now moved into the teens or the
double-digit levels as a percentage of our overall data center business. So we're very
conﬁdent that our position in here will continue to grow as we go forward and we're
very pleased with the overall acceptance that we've seen so far.
And just last question on the data center side -- actually on the inferencing. One of
the things that Jensen said was driven by -- the inferencing opportunities, driven by
advancements in conversational AI. What is conversational AI? And where do we see
this right now?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. Conversational AI is a great new thing. We demonstrated a bit of it a couple of
months ago at our GTC. And what we're talking about here is a discussion with your
computing platform, whether that be your phone, whether that be your PC. And a
response back in a simulated speech. So what that is, is both understanding natural
language processing, speech recognition and synthesizing back in voice. This can be
everything from recommendation engines as well as just (catering) for overall
answers with just a normal conversation type of look.
A lot of this started in its early stages with the release of Google in BERT. BERT is
their natural language processing model and many of the hyperscales are working
to adopt something similar. So yes, we're in the early stages. But this is yet again
another super important evolution of AI, AI training and the overall neural nets that
will be needed to support this type of feature.
Then the -- on the -- you also talked about the RTX Server to target rendering remote
workstations, cloud gaming and that Disney and Pixar have embraced this solution
as customers. What is the implication of RTX Server? What is it?

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 10Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Colette M. KressSure. RTX Server as well as our RTX overall Quadro workstations are super important
for this piece of rendering that happens in the enterprise. Very popular in the ﬁlm
industry and the overall design industry. They spend hours of building frame by
frame what they need for many of the special eﬀects that we see in all these great
movies. And what that usually takes is overnight work sending out the overall data
forms for them to overall render that, for them to come back, look at the overall work
and continue to make tweaks.
We are now able to do that rendering in real time with our overall capabilities with
our ray trace overall GPUs. So our GPUs availability within Quadro. And we have
more than 10 diﬀerent OEMs that have built the RTX Servers that will also be able to
transform the amount of time. That's generally, again, a CPU market. There's
probably about 1.5 million overall CPUs installed. And over the next several years, we
hope to refresh those with GPU oﬀerings that allow them to speed up the entire
rendering process.
Okay. We have about 2 minutes left and I do want to have an opportunity for anyone
from the ﬂoor to ask a question. Do we have a question from the audience?
On the Mellanox transaction, is there any concentration of that sort of 2 big suppliers
getting together, particularly in China, obviously, given the background of...
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
In the case of NVIDIA and Mellanox, as we had discussed at the announcement of
the deal, what is unique about this is there really is absolutely no overlap in terms of
the work that we do. We each provide unique pieces within the data center in terms
of the capabilities. I think our work is complementary and we will continue to provide
both our products as well as their products as we move forward. The goal of this is
the strategic opportunities as we move forward, what can we now build together
long term in order to help improve and advance this overall industry. But no other
feedback that we've received.
And that will have to be the last word. Colette, thank you very much for joining us
today.
