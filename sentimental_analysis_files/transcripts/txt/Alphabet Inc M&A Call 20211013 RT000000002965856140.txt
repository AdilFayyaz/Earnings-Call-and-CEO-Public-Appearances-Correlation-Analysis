Hi, I'm Aparna Sinha. Welcome to Day 2 of Google Cloud Next. I'll be co-hosting
today alongside Urs Holzle and we've got a really great lineup of new technology
and demos from Google Cloud. But before we get started, I want to thank you all for
taking time out of your busy week to be here with us. Yesterday was an incredible
ﬁrst day at Next.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

Urs HolzleThomas and Sundar made some amazing announcements. This week, we're
releasing over 100 new products, services and programs for you. We're kicking oﬀ
Day 2 now with this keynote, A Cloud Built For Developers. After this, we'll jump right
into a live developer Q&A, where you can ask us anything. And then tomorrow is
Community Day and that will be totally dedicated to you for learning, discussions,
networking and all kinds of fun. All right. Let's get things started by welcoming Urs.
Hi, Urs.
{BIO 15314490 <GO>}
Hi, Aparna. Hi, everyone. I hope you're as excited as I am to get started today. And
since this is a developer keynote, we'll kick it oﬀ with our ﬁrst demo right away from
Google Research and our DeepMind colleagues, who've been working on some
amazing voice technology.
(Audio-Video Presentation)
Now before you get too impressed by my language skills, I did not actually speak
these words. What you just heard is a custom text to speech model that has trained
on my voice and that can generate synthetic speech in diﬀerent languages. And our
teams have already started using this technology to improve our voice experience
for all users.
That's right. Google's Project Euphonia is already using custom voice to help people
with a typical speech to communicate and be better understood. Technology like
this creates a more inclusive world. To ﬁnd out more about this, check out the Project
Euphonia website. Custom voice is available today for select cloud customers. We're
very mindful of the potential misuses of this technology and we're taking great care
to prevent them by reviewing each use case uniquely.
{BIO 15314490 <GO>}
Now, look around you. Every day you see innovation that's brought to you by
developers, like yourself with persistence and skill. And Google has a long tradition
of supporting developers in open source and elsewhere. For years you've been
using technologies, like Kubernetes, Firebase, TensorFlow, Go, Angular, gRPC many
others. And when we built Google Cloud, we built it for developers and we were
inspired by all the things you've created with it. And our job is quite simply to make it
easier for you to do what you love. So we focus on making you as productive as
possible with the least amount of eﬀort. And so in everything we design, we take all
the feedback that you're sharing with us and build a cloud platform that just works,
whether that's by natively embedding key security or sustainability features into the
platform itself or by featuring partner solutions right within our own console, we're
really focused on one goal, giving you the best developer experience of any cloud
provider.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

Urs HolzleGoogle Cloud has had tremendous traction with digital native customers since our
very early days. How have you seen customer and partner adoption evolve since
then?
{BIO 15314490 <GO>}
Well, many of our biggest customers are cloud natives, but we've seen tremendous
adoption by a broad segment of enterprise customers in traditional industries as
well, like entertainment or ﬁnancial services.
For example, Major League Baseball, which is North America's oldest and most
attendanced professional sports league is using Google Cloud to modernize fan
engagement and to increase operational eﬃciency. And Equifax, which was founded
in 1899 and is one of the world's largest consumer credit reporting agencies is
transforming itself from a credit bureau to a next generation data analytics and
technology company built on Google Cloud.
We've seen a huge shift. Essentially every company is becoming a tech company to
increase their competitiveness and establish leadership in their industries. Developer
talent and cloud services are at the heart of this shift. Whether you call that digital
transformation or something else, companies of all sizes are ﬁnding that Google
Cloud is optimized to help make your data, your applications and your talent more
useful and relevant to your business.
{BIO 15314490 <GO>}
Exactly. And as Thomas mentioned yesterday, everyone needs to be thinking
through how they will fundamentally shift into a technology company to serve their
customers in the most meaningful ways, 10 years from now. And you as developers
are key to making this happen. So organizations ask themselves, do we have the
most cutting-edge technology to become a leader in our industry? And you the
developers are well equipped to answer this. And we are super focused on making
you and your company successful, and there's two areas we focus on to support your
growth.
First, of course, making it easier for developers to get their job done; second,
investing in the developer community so that everyone can learn and grow from
each other. So let's talk about how Google Cloud is making it easier for developers
to get their job done. From our transformational infrastructure stack to our deep
innovations in data, security, ML, every feature we release starts with simplifying the
developer experience, take our open cloud experience for example. We recently
expanded our compute stack to include Tau VMs that deliver 42% better price
performance over any other comparable solution in the market with no recompile.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 69Aparna Sinha
Urs HolzleAnd thanks to our zero trust approach to security, Google Cloud was ranked a leader
in IaaS Platform Native Security by Forrester well ahead of the competition.
And of course, we're focusing also on managed services that make it easy for you to
deploy scale and manage Kubernetes clusters on the edge or in the cloud. And
Google cloud has the most complete and most secure container experience for
developers.
In fact, the 2021 Gartner Solution Scorecard for Google Kubernetes Engine gave
GKE an overall score of 92, again, well ahead of the competition. And of course with
GKE and Anthos, you can run these containers anywhere on premise or the clouds,
on the edge, anywhere.
So it's fair to say that in a year since Google invented Kubernetes, containers have
really completely revolutionized IT operations. Now recently, European ﬁlmmakers
from Honeypot.io created a documentary on the history of Kubernetes and it will be
out in January 2022. And you are the very ﬁrst audience to have a look at the trailer
right now so let's roll out.
(Audio-Video Presentation)
This is such a great community.
{BIO 15314490 <GO>}
Yeah, absolutely. I recognize a lot of the faces and I can't wait to see the ﬁlm. Now
let's get back to how we're making it easier for developer for you to build really the
leading technology companies of tomorrow. Now Kubernetes deployments can
involve a fair bit of manual conﬁguration, clusters, nodes, load balancers, YAMLs, et
cetera. But not on Google Cloud because we oﬀer you the most automated and
secure Kubernetes experience available. With GKE Autopilot, Google provisions and
manages the clusters entire underlying infrastructure, including control playing,
node pools, working nodes and they -- that lets you focus on the higher level
services and applications that you're building.
Nobody else oﬀers anything like this because beyond managing node upgrades,
GKE Autopilot also automatically conﬁgures security features, like Shielded GKE
Nodes, secure boot and workloads identity. And it also implements security best
practices by blocking the less safe features like external IPs or legacy authorization.
So you don't get a toy Kubernetes cluster with GKE Autopilot. You get a
sophisticated cluster that uses the best practices brought to you by the team that
brought to you Kubernetes itself.
So you're always up to date. And you get the same results as the experts without
having to be an expert yourself.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

Abby CareyThe pandemic put developers in the driver's seat. And you all drove GKE usage to
all-time highs. At the same time, we saw explosive growth in the use of Google
Cloud Serverless oﬀerings, especially Cloud Run, and Cloud Functions. It's mainly
enterprise developers who have driven this growth.
Cloud Run excels at developer experience. It's earned the highest customer
satisfaction rating among developers as measured by user research international.
Cloud Run combines the best of both worlds, bringing you serverless and
containers. There's no cluster to setup or conﬁgure. So developers are able to scale
seamlessly and securely. Under the hood, Cloud Run scales container instances in
isolated sandboxes. Any access outside a sandbox is mediated by network controls
or identity in access management or both. And it isn't just for new apps, Cloud Run
supports traditional workloads like Java Spring Boot and ASP.NET.
We also recently introduced committed use discounts to lower the cost at scale, and
we've introduced always on CPU, which enables asynchronous and background
processes to be used on Cloud Run. So you have all the beneﬁts of serverless
without the restrictions. The theme here is easier, more secure development,
especially with remote work.
{BIO 15314490 <GO>}
You're absolutely right. We've been focusing on remote development for some time
now, but the pandemic has certainly accelerated the shift. Now, what would be more
essential to remote development than to be able to use the full power of GCP right
from your laptop with zero local setup.
Cloud Shell Editor is a context of where remote development environment that lets
you develop and manage applications securely from any browser. It supports
languages like Go, Java, Node, Python, C Sharp and it comes with an integrated
Debugger, Source Control, API Explorer and if you want to test locally on your
laptop, it also comes with local emulators for Kubernetes and serverless APIs.
Thank Urs. Next let me introduce you to Abby Carey. She is going to show us how
Google Cloud makes it easy for you to securely build modern applications, again
right from your laptop. Hi, Abby.
Hi, Aparna. We developers have had a hard time writing, extending, deploying and
operating applications, but it doesn't have to be diﬃcult. Let's start with Cloud Shell
Editor. It comes with current versions of your favorite dev tools, like Docker,
minikube, Skaﬀold, and more, there is nothing to download or install locally. TutorialsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

Abby Careyare built into Cloud Shell Editor, which makes it easy to come up to speed on
complex topics, like GKE.
So no more switching between tabs, docs your terminal and your code. This
integrated experience is highly diﬀerentiated from other clouds. You can even author
your own tutorials. And that allows your organization to share best practices and
onboard new hires faster.
Another popular feature is Kubernetes YAML authoring assistance. Let's say I want to
add YAML for a service to this project. I can press control space and then ﬁnd the
Kubernetes service snippet. Now I can tab through and ﬁll everything in. I also get
auto completes. And if I happen to make a formatting mistake, I am notiﬁed that
there's an issue in real time.
Now, many of you prefer to work locally in an IDE, this same YAML authoring
assistance, it's also available for VSCode and IntelliJ via the Cloud Code plug-in.
Cloud Code has built-in support for both Cloud Run and Kubernetes.
In fact, if you're using Cloud Run or Functions, you don't need to know Docker. You
can build and deploy your app with just one command because Cloud Code --
because Code Build is integrated under the hood. This is an application with no
Dockerﬁle. With the new G-Cloud Run deploy command, all I have to do is provide a
name for my service and then let it know where my source code lives, which is this
current directory. And we're deploying.
So nice. And thanks to this ease-of-use, 98% of users deploy an application to Cloud
Run on their ﬁrst try in less than ﬁve minutes.
I just showed Source Code deploys the Cloud Run, but there are more ways Google
Cloud has made deployment easier and more secure. First, I can scan my build
container images to check for vulnerabilities. I've already run an on-demand scan on
one of my images using G-Cloud Artifacts Docker images scan. Now, I can copy the
ID of my scan and then view my images vulnerabilities with the list of vulnerabilities
command. Now once that's ﬁnished, a severity level is assigned to each vulnerability
to help you prioritize.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

Abby CareyThat's super important. It's really helpful in addressing security concerns earlier in
the software development lifecycle. But now, what if your build pipeline is
compromised?
For that, I can enable binary authorization on my deployed Cloud Run services. This
way, only trusted container images are deployed to production.
Binary authorization is truly unique in the industry. It enables you to put proactive
security measures in place to reduce software supply chain attack risk by blocking
deployments that violate policy. And speaking of deploying, we're making it
seamless for you to do CI/CD securely. You can take advantage of serverless build
environments within your own private network with Cloud Build private pools.
And for advanced CD, we have Google Cloud deploy, which allows you to create
custom, delivery pipelines for your speciﬁc use case and needs.
That is so cool. So a real application connects to many supporting cloud services. So
Abby, can you show us an example of how we make these integrations easier?
Sure. When creating a cloud function. It's easy to integrate with Secret Manager.
First, create a secret that stores your API key, which I've already done. Now, I can
either mount it as a volume or expose it as an environment variable, I'll mount it as a
volume and then I'll name my mount path.
This will always point to the latest version of my secret. And now, I can securely
reference this API key from my source code. This abstraction enables portability and
a better local development experience. Cloud Run also integrates with seeker
manager to make it easier to do the right thing and not put sensitive data in source.
Love that so much. Okay. So now you've written your app, you've deployed your
app, and you've connected your app to other Google Cloud Resources. What's next?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

Urs HolzleOperating your app in production. With Cloud Ops, you get one integrated view for
your alerts, events, metrics and logs. No more jumping around multiple tools, as you
try to understand what went wrong.
That was so awesome, Abby. Thank you for sharing this with us.
Thanks, Aparna.
In each of these instances, we've done the integration work for you because the
more work we put into this, the less work you have to do, and this principle applies
to security as well. We've put a lot of energy into building security natively into
everything we do, so that you can innovate with assurance. Both GKE and Cloud Run
beneﬁt from the security ﬁxes, we implement before vulnerabilities are exposed. Just
think about the famous vulnerability and covered in how Kubernetes was handling
proxy requests. We found it, we coordinated and communicated the disclosure. We
ﬁxed it for the entire Kubernetes community and we patched all our products before
any customers were impacted. More recently, cyber threats have shifted the focus
towards the software supply chain.
{BIO 15314490 <GO>}
That's right. Malicious actors are trying to compromise the software supply chain
from bad code submission to by-passing this CI/CD pipeline all together. And to
help solve this problems, we've proposed an industry standard called SLSA.
It's a security framework that provides common criteria for increasing levels of
software security through automation and through cryptographic signing at each
stage of the software supply chain. And that makes it possible, but not necessarily
easy and so making it easy for developers to ensure security is super important. And
that's why we're focusing on building the security right into the developer tool chain,
anticipating and preventing issues ahead of time not when you're most at risk. So,
for example, Cloud Build our service that lets you build, test and deploy across
multiple environments such as VMs, Serverless, Kubernetes or Firebase, now oﬀers
SLSA Level 1 compliance by default. Because Cloud Build gives you veriﬁable build
provenance.
So this provenance, lets you trace a binary to the source code that it was built from to
prevent tampering and to prove that the code that you think you're running actually
is the code you are running. Cloud Build is the ﬁrst and only CI/CD service to oﬀer
this capability, but we go beyond that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 69Aparna Sinha
Urs HolzleAs you've seen build integrity, automatically generates digital signatures, which can
then be validated before deployment by binary authorization. That's another Google
Cloud ﬁrst. And so without you needing to do anything, we prevent anyone in your
organization from deploying code that has not been built by your legitimate build
system.
Now ensuring security post-deployment is equally critical. On GCP you can enable
continuous scanning and you can use our Service Mesh to embrace a zero trust
security model, and automatically and declaratively secure your services and the
communication. So you can manage authentication, authorization, and encryption
between services with little or no changes to the applications themselves. Let me say
that again. With little to no changes to the applications themselves. So that means
that these security improvements help secure not just new code, but also existing
binaries, so you can use them for any application that you're migrating to the cloud.
Both Anthos Service Mesh and now Cloud Build Hybrid are available across Google
Cloud and your on-premise environment, and they worked with VPC Service
Controls and VPC Peering to automate the developers security for your enterprise.
No other cloud provider protects your software supply chain to this level because we
started working on software supply chain security long before it was in headlines.
And so by choosing GCP, you beneﬁt from this leading edge focus on security.
Whether we're building foundational open-source technologies, like Kubernetes or
Istio or turning them into fully managed services, like GKE and Anthos Service Mesh,
our goal is always to reduce complexity for our users. By helping create these
industry standards, we can provide safer and simpler services for you, the developer.
And that's exactly our approach to securing the software supply chain. We've co-
founded the open-source security foundation with other technology leaders to
create security standards for open-source software, and we're starting to bring
products to market like open-source insights, which provides you a complete
transitive dependency graph for many open source packages.
Now, let's turn back to Urs to hear why Google Cloud is best positioned to support
you in becoming a technology leader in your industry using data as a core asset.
{BIO 15314490 <GO>}
Thanks. Yeah. So far, we've been talking about developing and managing code. But
data is at the heart of many enterprises. So we also have the leading data cloud
products in the industry, designed for optimal performance and reliability for
applications of all sizes, while scaling to immense capacity.
Now, let's start with databases. When it comes to databases every cloud gives you
choices. They oﬀer SQL databases, which are great, but unfortunately, don't scale.
And of course, no SQL databases, which do scale, but unfortunately are not SQL.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 69Aparna Sinha
Dev Ittycheria
Aparna Sinha
Dev IttycheriaOnly Google Cloud gives you a third choice with Spanner, because Spanner is SQL.
And in fact, it just got a postgres interface, but it scales horizontally and you can
literally handle a billion requests per second. Nobody else has a scalable SQL
system. So it's no wonder we're seeing huge adoption. Now on that data warehouse
side, we have of course the leading cloud data warehouse with BigQuery, hundreds
of customers are using BigQuery at petabyte scale today. Petabyte each and you can
run of course, BigQuery Omni on AWS or Azure.
On top of that, open source systems for data like processing, like ﬂank, spark and
beam run natively on Google Cloud in a simpler and more cost-eﬀective way than in
other environments. In fact, you can realize a 57% lower TCO compared to on-
premise data leaks for data science projects. Now, on top of that savings, our Data
Cloud also includes the world's ﬁrst and only auto scaling and serverless spark
service. And ﬁnally, Google has deep partnerships with leading data-driven
companies, including Databricks, Conﬂuent, MongoDB, Redis Labs and many others.
And so together, we help customers access an open platform that powers analytics
at scale yet is easy to use.
Our partner community is central to the health of our Cloud business and we're
especially excited about the innovation coming from our data cloud partnerships.
Together, we've optimized our infrastructure for performance and eﬃciency to give
our partners that extra edge, when they run on Google Cloud.
One of our leading data partners is MongoDB. And we have their CEO, Dev
Ittycheria with us today. Welcome Dave.
{BIO 1966070 <GO>}
Hi, everyone. Happy to be here.
Dave, one of the trends we're seeing in our enterprise customer base is that they are
now competing for leadership positions in their industry by becoming technology
companies. How would you say, Google Cloud and MongoDB working together can
help these customers achieve that transition?
{BIO 1966070 <GO>}
Well, Aparna, the companies who are in the leadership positions in their industries
are those who have built their competitive advantage using software and data to
transform their business. And the key word here is build. You can't buy a competitive
advantage. You have to build it. This means you need to enable your developers to
innovate as quickly as possible whether it's building new software to seize new
opportunities or to respond to new threats. MongoDB and Google Cloud deeply
understand this. Developers choose MongoDB on Google Cloud, because we giveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

services available in the Google Cloud console for easy discovery and deployment.
Today MongoDB Atlas runs in 24 Google regions across the world with deep
technical integrations with Google's analytic and AI tools. This enables our
customers to innovate quickly and emerge as leaders in their industries. As a result,
we're seeing explosive growth of customers embracing the true value of our
partnership.
That's incredible. So when you think about the development teams at these new
customers, what's the biggest challenge that you're helping them solve?
{BIO 1966070 <GO>}
Yeah, when you talk to development teams, you ﬁnd that they spend the most
amount of their time trying to work with data as serving relevant data at the right
time to the right audience is critical to building any application. Unfortunately,
relational databases are not designed for the way developers think or code. Nor they
are designed for scale, fault tolerance or resilience. Consequently development
teams ﬁnd it hard to move fast using relational databases.
MongoDB is designed to address this problem, we make it very easy for developers
to work with data and we're able to address the most demanding requirements of
performance, scale and fault tolerance. The partnership with MongoDB and Google
Cloud enables developers around the world to easy build modern software
applications to address their needs of today and tomorrow.
That's terriﬁc. Thank you so much for being here with us today.

improve their productivity. Automate tasks that are repetitive, master the command
line, use the best tools that make your life easier or reuse other people's code, just to
name a few. And another great way to accelerate your productivity is with building
blocks or templates or fully managed services in areas like machine learning.
Because on Google Cloud, you don't have to be an expert to build smart

So with that, let's go to our next live demo. Joining me today is Anu Srivastava. She's
going to show us how these breakthroughs in AI are advancing cloud adoption and
redeﬁning the world of document processing. Hi, Anu.
Hey, Aparna. We all know how to work with data when it's in a structured format, like
in a database, some JSON, CSV ﬁles are just variables in my code, right. But what
about unstructured data? Many of the world's business processes start to include or
end with a document, but these documents can be diﬃcult to process. Think about
all the ways, you could enhance your application if you could just unlock that data.
This is where Google Cloud Document AI comes in.
DocAI is a platform that has solutions and tooling for automating your workﬂows
backed by machine learning. We've bundled together some of Google's ﬂagship AI
technology such as Computer Vision, OCR, Natural Language Understanding and
even Google's Expertise and building knowledge graphs, all to provide you with a
simple yet powerful way to build applications that better understand unstructured
data. Let's go see a demo of DocAI in action.
So here we have a receipt. I was buying some oﬃce supplies since we are
unfortunately not back in the oﬃce yet. What I'm going to do is I'm going to actually
upload this into the DocAI platform. So in our Cloud console, we have the DocAI
platform where we have built-in preview mechanisms so you can test out your
documents. So this is going to an end point, which has a specialized model we have
speciﬁcally trained on a variety of expenses. Google maintains and improves the
models for you.
Wait a minute. I hope this is not with my data.
Absolutely not. We never use your data to train our models. Your data is only used to
serve your request. So let's take a look at the data extracted.
I've seen this before. Next you're going to tell me that you're going to automate my
expenses.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

Anupriya SrivastavaI knew you would say that this is the canonical demo use case, right? But have you
ever seen it like this? Take a look at this ﬁeld that I'm highlighting, the supplier
address. This address isn't present anywhere in the document.
Wow, where did that come from?
This is only possible with Google's Document AI. The secret sauce here is that the
knowledge graph is able to not only give you back the original text from document,
but it's going to enrich your response, akin to what you'd see in a search, but as part
of your API response.
Wow, that's really great.
And it's not just this, we have several specialized models for many more document
types of much higher complexity. Let's take a look at this payslip. So I ran this earlier
and we're looking at the preview output again.
You can see that we have some keys, we have some ﬁelds, you can see enrichment
on the employer name and the address. Once your data is in a schematized format,
meaning that we know for every document of certain doc type there are common
important pieces of information. So what we did is we predeﬁned a set of keys. So
what we do is with your extracted data, we merge your data to these predeﬁned
keys. So it's much easier to work with an raw OCR. So once it's in a schematized
format, it's easier to pass on to a downstream service or maybe you're using
something for analytics like, BigQuery or Looker.
That makes sense. But what about ensuring accuracy? And also do you have multi-
language support?
We know that with important documents such as these, you can't aﬀord any missteps
when it comes to accuracy. So that's why DocAI provides a human-in-the-loop
conﬁguration to trigger on conﬁdence scores so either for speciﬁc keys or on the
entire document itself. And as for translation, we support over 100 languages such asFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

Human-in-the-loop translation and knowledge graph capabilities that can be applied
to a wide variety of documents. This seems super useful. Of course, the next big
question is, can it be applied to big bulky complex documents like business
contracts?
Let's take a look. So here, I read a contract earlier this morning. You can see that
there are typical things you'd ﬁnd in any contract. There are some document names,
the parties involved, some dates and like with every easy-to-read contract being
sarcastic here, there is an expiration term. So this expiration date actually isn't
present anywhere in the document and it's actually not easy to ﬁgure out. It's not in
an easily parsable format. Shocker, Google's contract processor is able to ﬁgure out
this date value by understanding signals found across the entire document.
Wow. Well, Anu before you go. Can you tell our awesome developers, how they can
get started with DocAI?
Absolutely. So I know we covered a lot at just breakneck speeds. So check out the

Another area that Google has invested in deeply and that's becoming more
important to more companies is sustainability. Many cloud providers have a visionFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

Aparna Sinhafor as in sustainable future. And many aim to have to match their electricity
consumption with a 100% renewable energy by 2025 or 2030.
We accomplished a 100% renewable energy in 2017. So we're the only hyperscale
cloud to do this today. And all that with data centers that are twice as eﬃcient as the
average data center.
This past week, Sundar talked about Google's goal to enable over a billion users to
live and work more sustainably by next year. To reach goals like this, and those
outlined in climate pledges made by more organizations every day. We rely on
developers like you to do something about it, but we also know that it's diﬃcult.
{BIO 15314490 <GO>}
That's right. One of the biggest challenges that companies face is that they lack the
tools to account for environmental costs and to help developers address this for
their organizations we built sustainability tools directly into Google Cloud. With
Google Cloud carbon footprint, you have access to the energy-related emissions
data that you need for external carbon disclosures in just one click. Now you won't
need this calculator, if you just want to report the net carbon footprint of your
workload on GCP, because on GCP, it's always zero.
We also have our region-picker where you can choose the data center region with
the lowest gross carbon cost right now. Of course, again your net impact is zero, no
matter what region you pick. But this tool lets you help go one step further to
become carbon free, not just carbon neutral. Now that's actually a tool that I can't
wait to deprecate in 2030 or so, because Google Cloud has committed to be 100%
carbon free by 2030, every hour of every day. Now, we also realize there's still a lot
to learn when it comes to building sustainably and to help, we just released a master
class called Sustainable IT Decoded with some of the world's top experts. So check it
out for guidance on how we can all build more sustainably.
Now we all were proud to run the cleanest cloud in the industry, we're even more
inspired by the work that our customers are doing with Google Cloud to solve
climate change challenges that are unique to their business. And today, we bring
you a preview of Google Earth Engine and its integration with Google Cloud.
With over 700 datasets and 50 petabytes of data today, Earth Engine gives scientists
and developers access to the world's largest catalogue of satellite imagery and to
tools for driving sustainable impact.
So let's look at this in a bit more detail. With an example of how Google Earth

Thanks, Aparna. The world is constantly changing and that creates opportunities and
risks. Helping uncover critical insights about the changing world, that's why we are
integrating Earth Engine into Google Cloud. Now integration is now in private
preview. Today, I'll demo a workﬂow that combines Vertex AI, Earth Engine, BigQuery
and Google Maps platform to show how Google Cloud makes it incredibly easy for
you to innovate and deliver insights and do it quickly. So here's a scenario.
You work at an insurance company and you need to analyze your company's
exposure to ﬂood risk. You think new buildings may be a strong contributor to that
risk. You want to test your hypothesis. To do that, we ﬁrst needed to understand
where the built environment is expanding. In other words, we just need to categorize
the surface of the entire planet. That could be hard, but Vertex AI oﬀers the tooling
to develop a best-in-class ML model, and Earth Engine provides constantly updated
data.
Let's fast forward a bit. We ﬁnished training our model and now Earth Engine is
sending satellite imagery to be categorized. So your understanding of the world can
update in near real-time. Here's the Earth Engine script showing the results of that
model. This area in red is where the model estimates the locations of buildings,
that's your current built environment. To ﬁnd the change over time, we need a few
more lines of code. These lines of code give us a built environment to 2016 and here,
we calculate the diﬀerence between 2016 and today. When there's a change, it
shows up in purple on the map. This is where there are new buildings. So next, we're
going to export, sample and export the data, so we can do additional analysis in
BigQuery.
Over into BigQuery console, this script clusters those data points here and then
outputs polygons that show the areas with the biggest changes in the built
environment. So at this point, you have a few options. You could combine this data
with ﬂood locations, you identify around the world. Also with Earth Engine, maybe
you want to enhance your model with weather data and physical terrain data that's
available on Earth engine, too. You could also include data on your company's
insurance portfolio to gain additional insight into critical risks.
We'll wrap up this demo by visualizing our results in a new feature available in
Google Maps platform. The open source data viz library deck.gl with a BigQuery
connector provided by CARTO. So we now have a clear picture of where the built
environment is changing and where to focus next for our work on ﬂood risks.
In summary, no wrangling data, no need to manage infrastructure just actionable
insights incredibly quickly. We can't wait to see what you'll do with Earth Engines
new integration with Google Cloud. And with that, I'll pass it back to Aparna.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

Questions And Answers
(Question And Answer)
Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for the developer live Q&A. I'm Aja. And a
reminder, that this Q&A is live. If you want to join the conversation reach out on
Twitter with the #GoogleCloudNext. We've reached out asking for your questions on
social media and you all have been responding. We will be answering your
questions during the next 20 minutes. And ﬁrst of all, let's welcome Priyanka, who's
here to answer your questions with me today. Hi Priyanka.
Thanks, Aja. That keynote was absolutely amazing. Yes. So let's get into the goodness
that Urs and Aparna shared a highlight for me was really that upcoming
documentary on Kubernetes, so cool. I also enjoyed the Google Cloud innovator
community announcement, securing software supply chain and building sustainably.
What caught your eye?
A lot of the stuﬀ you just mentioned. Deﬁnitely our innovations and sustainability, the
ability to see your carbon footprint of your cloud workloads is really, really cool.
When I heard about it in yesterday's keynote, I immediately went and looked at all
my personal projects to see the carbon costs of what I had been doing. And I love
having that kind of data to use in decision-making like it help me make the right
decisions. But I'm mostly really, excited about the cloud innovators program. I've
really missed interacting with our Google Cloud Dev Community.
I wanted to hear and see all the amazing things the community has been up to. And
the innovators program should let us do that and we're working on some super
special Innovators Only events in 2022 that I can't wait to tell the community about.
Wow. Yeah. That all sounds really amazing. I'm also excited about that secure supply
chain announcement SLSA. And how the combination of cloud build and binary
authorization actually helps kick start your journey to secure your software artifacts
by fully automating that build process.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

A - Aja Hammerly
A - Priyanka VergadiaYeah. That's just so interesting. That's so cool. So let's get -- to our ﬁrst question.
We've got the questions coming in, just for the folks at home, the backstage crew is
looking for your tweets as well. So keep them coming in during the thing we will be
bringing them in live.
So our ﬁrst question is from Asher. And it is, who would be good candidates for the
participation in the private preview of Earth Engine.
Yeah. So anybody who is like doing work on sustainable things, right? So with the
sustainability lens, if you're thinking about ﬁnancial services, the customer packaged
goods and their impact on the environment and how all of that can be combined
together. So, yeah, anything that you're doing with the sustainability lens, obviously,
it's in private preview. So you have to qualify and stuﬀ, but if you have that angle of
sustainability, you're probably a right ﬁt for it.
Awesome. Thank you for that. Second question, came in from Priyanka's Twitter. I saw
this one this morning as I was coming in to do this Q&A. And this one is any
examples -- do we have any examples of end-to-end spark based pipelines for ML.
They'd love to see them. Speciﬁcally they're interested in learning how Serverless
Spark can be leveraged in big data and ML Ops framework on Google Cloud.
Yeah, so thank you for this question. I think it came from Pranav. I saw my Twitter this
morning. So really what it's all about is the Serverless Spark ML framework is about
you not having to create your back-end infrastructure to run Spark. So that's all taken
care of for you, so you can just run your workloads, which is in this case like you're
trying to run a machine learning Spark job. You can just get started by not worrying
about the infrastructure, so that's one part.
The other piece of it is the Vertex workbench, which is the Jupyter notebook, but
hosted, but it also gives you the opportunity to connect with Dataproc or the Spark
ML jobs that you might have built and run all of that. So as a Data Scientist, I can just
use my workbench. And that becomes my home to kind of get the data, massage it,
connect with Dataproc Spark ML jobs, and then get all those predictions right in that
one spot.
Awesome. Thanks, Priyanka. That was a really comprehensive answer. So now we
have a question from Christopher. And it's what are the beneﬁts of the innovators
program? You mind, if I take this one?
Yeah, please.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

events. Like we're going to be doing some AMAs we're planning right now, road
map meetings potentially. And there's also an innovators virtual background that you
can download and then use in your Google Meet meetings.
Wow, another question came in from Twitter. Awesome. So let me read this one. My
POV. Massive focus on the security -- massive focus on security focus in the
developer cloud. Isn't this a topic that matters more for the managers of developers
than for developers? And I'll take this one too if it's cool with you.
Yeah.
So I'm a manager. And yeah, that's a really good question. Security is vital to all
aspects of software development and security needs to be everyone's job. Yeah,
managers need to care a lot about it, but we need to make the tools, so that
developers can do the right thing automatically. And that everyone is participating in
making our cloud more secure. And we talked about some of those things. We
talked about our tooling that can help you to make sure that you put your secrets in
secure locations as opposed to putting them in code.
We talked about the SLSA. We talked about lots of other parts and all of this is part
of a secure software supply chain, but security does need to be everyone's job.
Managers can help by teaching their developers and enforcing it, but everyone
needs to take the steps to make things more secure. So yes, good point, but
everyone is involved.
Okay. This is a great one from Priyanka's LinkedIn. Is it possible to connect to the
public IP of a cloud SQL instance from a private cloud run service, we have been
asked this one before when visiting customers?
Yeah.
Also, is this a -- is this cross project setup? Cloud Run service and Cloud SQL
instance are on separate GCP projects. So can you do a cross project setup with your
database in your running room service somewhere else, Priyanka?
You actually can. So you have, so in this scenario, you have a Cloud SQL instance in
one project and you have your -- you have your compute or whatever is calling thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 21 of 69A - Aja Hammerly
A - Priyanka Vergadia
A - Aja Hammerlycloud SQL instance in another project and you could totally make them work by
using what is called as private server -- private service access. What it does is it
connects the two together even with a private IP? So you don't even have to expose
a public IP for your Cloud SQL instance, which as again comes back to the security
point, you were making earlier.
Everybody has to think about security. So you're not exposing with public IP. You're
just using the private IP of your Cloud SQL instance and connecting it to the virtual
machine or wherever you're running your compute to call your search from. So it's
possible, private service access is the service you're looking forward to kind of
connect the two together. It's a VPC oﬀering.
Awesome. Thank you so much, Priyanka. Cool. A question from Andy. This is one of
my favorites. So there's a lot of ways to run an application on Google Cloud. It's a
huge platform. How do I know what should I choose? Where do I run my stuﬀ?
Should I run it on GKE, Compute Engine, Cloud Run? So many good choices.
Yeah. This is a question we get a lot, right? And it's -- it really just depends on your
situation. And the situations can be a lot, the type of team, the size of team and the
number of number of developers you have and the languages that you might be
using. So there are lots of diﬀerent scenarios in which you can decide. So I'll give an
example of a few. So for example, Compute Engine. Like, if you're migrating and you
just want to get from on-premise infrastructure into cloud and you just want the
speed, you just want to get there. I would choose Compute Engine to just migrate as
is and then modernize later if needed. Sometimes you don't need to modernize,
because if you have licensing requirements and stuﬀ like that. So that's Compute
Engine. If you want to work with containers, need a little bit more abstraction -- less
abstraction. You can work with containers with GKE and that gives you a lot more
control over the number of nodes you have and the processing that you're using.
But if you might be just wanting to run containers, but don't want to manage the
underlying infrastructure by nodes and stuﬀ like that and the regions, just use Cloud
Run, because it's serverless, but it allows you to use your container images and just
deploy them.
Cloud Functions is kind of like everywhere. So you're trying to do -- we handle one
function or a piece or a feature of code that you just deploy in a function -- as a
function as a code sort of service, but it kind of applies everywhere. So I wouldn't
say, so cloud function is not like or it's more of and, like it works with any of those,
just more of an extension and enhancement of your services with serverless. So I
hope that helped clarify a little bit of that, but there's a lot that goes in that decision.
Yeah, I know and I really liked how you called out the cloud functions is not an or, it's
and, Cloud Functions is just fantastic it is tying pieces together. It is one of the thingsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

A - Aja HammerlyI love about it. And I'm just going to point out for folks that we have sessions on all of
these in the breakouts. So if you want to go learn more about these, go look in our
breakouts and you can ﬁnd out more about the diﬀerent oﬀerings that Google Cloud
has.
So now we have a question from Esther. What languages do Cloud Run and Cloud
Function support? Let's see if I can do this from memory, I've been practicing. So
GCF. These are the standard languages you see on Google Cloud. We've got
Node.js, Python, Go, Java, .net, Ruby and PHP. I got them all. Awesome.
Cloud Run supports any language or any library, or any binaries that you can put in
the container. But if you want to use the source code deploys feature that Abby
showed earlier. That is supported on Node, Python, Go, Java and .net. And speciﬁc
versions of those languages are supported. So please do go to the website and
make sure the version that you need is the one that we support.
Great memory by the way.
Oh, yeah. I'm really good at naming all those languages. So from Salina. Oh, yes,
great question. When should I use GKE Autopilot versus Cloud Run?
I'll let you take that one.
You are going to let me take this one?
Yeah.
Okay. So this pretty much boils down to, do you want Kubernetes or not. If you want
Kubernetes, if you want the enhanced ﬂexibility that Kubernetes has, or you want to
have all those knobs and dials that you can turn to really ﬁne-tune everything for
your networking needs or your particular load proﬁle, use GKE Autopilot. If you want
to -- if you have a container and you want to run it on GCP and that's your goal,
Cloud Run is great, Cloud Run is fantastic at that. And as we pointed out, you don't
even need a container if you use Cloud Run source deploys for those languages I
just mentioned.

are supported with the DocAI stuﬀ that you talked about?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

A - Aparna SinhaOh, yeah. So you can do images and PDFs. It's really about the unstructured image
data. So PDFs and images.
So okay. Let's see what else we got. Oh, this one is from Mark and another one for
you Priyanka. It's another security question. So can you tell us more about binary
authorization? We covered it very brieﬂy in the keynote, but it's something I've been
hearing a lot about and I'd love to know a little more about it.
Yes. So again, it kind of boils down to the whole like security narrative that, that you
mentioned that everybody is kind of responsible for the security of the entire
platform. So in this case, but with binary authors really deploy time security. So you
are deploying and making sure that your images or container images if you're using
GKE or Cloud Run works with binary odd.
So when you're -- at your deployment stage, you have -- you can provide signature
authorizations on your images. So if -- and the veriﬁcation on the authorities for
those. So if they are authorized only binary art will apply the authorizations and once
the image is authorized only then you can deploy it.
Awesome. So I just got the signal that we're running out of time. So this is going to
unfortunately be the last question. And this question comes from Wesley. Can I use
the build integrity features with my on-prem software?
Huh. Okay. Yeah. So you kind of can. So with Cloud Build it's really any container
image which is built on Cloud Build. You can use both on -- you can use it in both on-
prem or on Google Cloud. You just have to use the binary attestation Cloud Build.
And it's on the GitHub page, so you can check that out. But if you're building it
within Cloud Build, you can deploy it on-prem or in Google Cloud.
Thanks Priyanka. Well, that was a lot of fun. It was great to hear all the questions from

Page 24 of 69Hi, everyone. I hope you enjoy the Dev Keynote. I'm Jeﬀ Reed, VP of Product for
Application Modernization Platform at Google Cloud. Thank you so much for being
with us here today. In most of my conversations with customers, I found they are
accelerating their technology adoption through the use of cloud-based services to
build and deliver new capabilities, like curbside pickup in retail, remote diagnostics
in manufacturing, and completely new experiences to better support their end
customers.
Today, I'm going to share some exciting announcements that will further empower
you to digitally transform your organization. We recognize that each company has
unique cloud needs. So we at Google Cloud are focused on three areas to support
you in whatever stage you are in your cloud evolution.
First, we set out to make your migration or modernization path easy. With Google
Cloud, you can easily evolve your existing applications or build new cloud-native
apps. Second, our open platform extends Google Cloud services and engineering
practices to hybrid and multi-cloud environments for consistent service delivery. And
third, our PlanetScale distributed infrastructure is transformative and delivers the
highest level of performance and availability in a secure and sustainable way.
One of our primary goals is to make it easy for you to deploy and scale and manage
Kubernetes anywhere. In the years since Google invented Kubernetes, containers
have completely revolutionized IT operations. Given our history, it is not surprising
that Google Kubernetes Engine, GKE, is the leading solution in the market, and even
Gartner agrees. In the recent Gartner Solution Scorecard, GKE scored 92 out of 100,
making it the absolute strongest strategic option among public cloud Kubernetes
services.
Until now, Kubernetes involved a fair amount of manual conﬁguration. You have to
manage your own clusters, nodes, GMO ﬁles, it's a lot. With our introduction at GKE
Autopilot, a new mode of operation in GKE, we're making it much easier for you to
use Kubernetes. Google provisions and manages the entire clusters underlying
infrastructure, including the control plane, node pools, worker nodes, letting you and
your developers focus on your software, while GKE Autopilot manages all aspects of
the infrastructure.
In the midst of the pandemic, we saw a large number of our customers adopting
serverless technologies. And that's no surprise, since serverless technology enables
companies to rapidly develop and deploy any application in a fully automated
environment. With services like Cloud Functions, Eventarc and Workﬂows, you can
easily set up event-driven serverless workﬂows that connect into Google Cloud,
third-party SaaS services or your own applications. Serverless is also about running
complex workloads at scale, while still preserving a delightful developer experience.
In fact, serverless with Cloud Run is about delivering a true developer platform with
the ﬂexibility to run any language, any library, any binary.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

A - Suraj RaoYou can bring traditional workloads such as Java Spring Boot, ASP.NET and more to
serverless compute now. Whether it's GKE Autopilot, Cloud Run or Cloud Functions,
our goal is to make it easy for you to build and scale apps how you want and where
you want.
Our second focus area is delivering open infrastructure cloud. It relies on open
source-based technology, like Kubernetes, Istio and Knative, delivering the
portability you expect. It also oﬀers you the choice and ﬂexibility to build the
manager apps across multiple clouds. To realize these beneﬁts, Anthos operates as a
cloud-backed control plane that provides consistent development and management
at scale across both edge, on-premise, and multi-cloud environments. It then
enables you to build and manage global ﬂeets and establish operational consistency
at scale.
Let's hear from my colleague, Rae Wang, who interviewed Jahid Khandaker and
Suraj Rao, the CIO and Global Head of Advanced Analytics at Western Digital on
their multi-cloud journey.
{BIO 20628940 <GO>}
Welcome and thank you for sharing your insights with our audience. We have been
working together since 2019 on Western Digital's cloud transformation. What initially
prompted you to focus on modernizing applications and standardizing software
delivery across the organization?
Thank you, Rae. We are happy to be here. As a result of various merger and
acquisitions, WDC became an integration of three corporations: HGST, WDC and
SanDisk. To support very diverse infrastructure and IT environments across the three
entities, switching to a cloud strategy became an imperative for driving to a
standardization.
Now, Jahid mentioned about the cloud strategy. In 2018, we saw tremendous growth
in IoT applications from our global factories that required low-latency and high-
speed on-premise solutions. However, now we were faced with this daunting task of
keeping our on-premise and the cloud solutions synched up. This led to exploring
solutions that provide a uniform management plane across our hybrid environment.
After trying multiple solutions for over two years, we chose Anthos. Anthos gives us
vendor-agnostic solution that works across GCP and on-premise environments, while
keeping the doors open for a multi-cloud future.
{BIO 20628940 <GO>}
That is great to hear, go Anthos. So, what does hybrid and multi-cloud strategy mean
to Western Digital?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

A - Aparna SinhaSure, Rae. Western Digital is making a pivotal strategy shift to Anthos for our big data
platform. We are migrating more than 25 business-critical applications seamlessly to
this hybrid environment with Anthos. This move has several advantages: a richer user
experience, greater security and enhanced ﬂexibility to manage factory applications.
Some of these critical applications include image analysis on millions of images a
week for factory disposition, machine learning workloads for real-time factory
decisions and many, many others.
{BIO 20628940 <GO>}
Thank you. That's a great strategy and some amazing use cases. Now looking
forward, what are your upcoming digital transformation goals in the next three to ﬁve
years for Western Digital?
Rae, the future at Western Digital is very exciting. We want to deliver excellence
everywhere. Ultimately, we see cloud technology as an enabler of our key business
priorities, reduce time to deliver services, rationalize our application footprints and
meet customer demand for IoT and edge applications.
{BIO 20628940 <GO>}
Thank you, Jahid and Suraj. I look forward to amazing work from this great
partnership.
Thanks, Jahid, Suraj and Rae. Since we announced Anthos back in 2019, we are
thrilled with the reception it has received in the market. In fact, as of Q2 2021, Anthos
compute under management grew more than 500% year-over-year. And today,
we're extending Anthos for even more workloads in more environments and in more
locations. We're announcing Anthos for VM to support development teams that want
to standardize in Kubernetes, but have existing workloads running on virtual
machines that could not be easily containerized. Once you shift or attach VMs
directly to the Anthos environment, you can leverage declarative conﬁguration and
policy management with Anthos Conﬁg Management, and end-to-end application
visibility and security with Anthos Service Mesh.
We're also introducing, one of my favorites, Anthos Multi-Cloud API, which enables
you to provision and manage GKE clusters running on AWS and Azure infrastructure
through a centralized Google backed control plane. Generally available today, the
Anthos Multi-Cloud API ensures your team has a consistent experience to create,
manage and update GKE clusters, regardless of which major public cloud you're
using.
Thank you for joining us on the path to revolutionizing cloud computing. Now, I'm
going to hand it over to Sachin Gupta, VP, GM for Infrastructure and longtime friend
to talk about how we're extending these innovations to dedicated environments.

Thanks, Jeﬀ. Great to be here in person. And it's great to see you all. Our goal in
Google Cloud is to meet you where you are in your digital transformation. We
understand some of your workloads cannot move to the public cloud entirely due to
various factors, such as high amounts of local data processing, low latency
requirements or strict data security and privacy requirements. But as you heard
yesterday from Thomas, we're working to help you solve some of these constraints.
With the announcement of Google Distributed Cloud, we are extending our
infrastructure to the edge and to your own data centers. This announcement allows
you to further digitize your business applications by ensuring they have the speed,
intelligence and processing power in managed heterogeneous environments. And
we're approaching this from a diﬀerentiated standpoint relative to other cloud
providers.
First, we bring Google's AI and analytics solutions closer to where the data is being
generated and consumed to harness real-time insights. Second, Google Distributed
Cloud is enabled by Anthos. It helps you to build and run applications on GKE
clusters and virtual machines anywhere with the cloud-backed control plane for
consistent management at scale. And third, our PlanetScale infrastructure delivers
the highest level of performance and availability on the most secure and sustainable
platform.
Google Distributed Cloud is a fully managed integrated hardware and software
solution. Meaning, you don't have to worry about the underlying infrastructure, and
can focus on your applications and business initiatives. We aim to simplify
operations, leveraging Google's expertise and track record in areas like scale
deployment, ﬂeet management and site reliability engineering. This allows you to
focus on your business priorities and leave the complexities to us.
Google Distributed Cloud is designed for running sensitive workloads that meet
sovereignty requirements and oﬀers private 5G LTE solutions for enterprise
customers. There are four deployment scenarios depending on the customers'
need: the Google network edge, the operator edge, the customer edge and
customer data centers.
The ﬁrst use case I'll talk through is that Google's network edge, which is designed
for single and multi-tenant use cases, leveraging over 140 Google network edge
locations worldwide.
Next is the operator edge. This is owned by communication service providers for
both single and multi-tenant cloud use cases. As I mentioned before, you'll beneﬁt
from 5G LTE services provided by our operator partners. It can accommodate
emerging services and applications with stringent latency and reliability
requirements. For example, online games and game streaming depend on low
latency to preserve the end-user experience.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

A - Sachin Gupta
A - Rasesh PatelThen we have the enterprise customer edge. These are customer-owned edge
locations, such as retail stores, factory ﬂoors or branch oﬃces, which require
localized compute and processing directly in these edge locations.
Next, the customer data centers are customer-owned facilities or colo facilities and
are set up for single and multi-tenant hybrid scenarios. It's also ideal for lifecycle
management of virtual network functions for communication service providers that
reside on-premises, such as cloud native build-out of private 5G networks.
Google Distributed Cloud also includes a hosted mode to run sensitive workloads.
Hosted mode helps you meet sovereignty needs by addressing data residency with
strict security and privacy requirements, all while providing you with a way to
modernize on-premise deployments. Customers can manage this directly or host
through a designated and trusted partner. The good news is that hosted mode does
not require connectivity to Google Cloud at any time to manage infrastructure, and
uses a local control plane for operations. Upgrades and patches are oﬀered by
Google and veriﬁed by the trusted partner.
To learn more about how customers are leveraging Google Distributed Cloud, I'd
like to welcome Rasesh Patel, Chief Product and Platform Oﬃcer, AT&T. Rasesh,
welcome to Next.
{BIO 16303010 <GO>}
Thanks, Sachin. It's so good to be here with you today.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Rasesh, why don't we dig right in and have you tell us about how you are looking to
leverage Google's Distributed Cloud for your edge and computing needs?
{BIO 16303010 <GO>}
You bet. I'd start with saying AT&T and Google have similar goals when it comes to
edge compute. We both want our business customers to build and run modern
applications close to their end users. By moving compute workloads closer to the
user, we can reduce latency to levels that will allow for a whole new range of mobile
experiences that weren't possible before. Sometimes this compute will be on the
network edge. Sometimes it will be at the customer premise. But regardless of where
the compute workloads occur, this is not something AT&T is going to do alone.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
That is tremendous. It is really fascinating how communications has been able to
inﬂuence business revolution. And it looks like you are poised to do it all over again.
So what kind of new business outcomes do you think we can bring together with 5G
and edge?

A - Sachin GuptaYou're absolutely right, Sachin. Our goal is to create net new business services and
customer experiences. Let me give you some industry examples.
In retail, services including streamlining automated inventory management,
predicting and managing cues, even enabling cashier list checkout options will
come to life. In healthcare, we see secure multi-gig connectivity for all devices within
a hospital. The advent of remote patient diagnostics and care and rapid data transfer
between ﬁeld-based emergency medical services, like an ambulance, and hospitals.
And in the entertainment industry, we're enhancing in-venue experiences for
concerts and sporting events, with solutions ranging from immersive AR and VR
experiences, smart parking, ticketless entry, to contactless food and souvenir
payment.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Last question. What are your goals for AT&T and Google partnership in the next
three to ﬁve years?
{BIO 16303010 <GO>}
Well, our work together brings market-transformative capabilities to businesses
across many industries. 5G and ﬁber-based edge connectivity and compute with
Google's powerful ecosystem that includes maps, voice recognition, AI, Android and
many other capabilities, enables the development of these next-gen experiences in
an accelerated time-to-market.
And we're looking forward to a lot of expansion. We're bringing our network-based
solution with Google Cloud to over 15 major markets in the next several years. We
have plans to roll out the services in major metro markets including Chicago, Atlanta,
Dallas, Miami, San Francisco and many more. So stay tuned.

Everything you just heard about Google Distributed Cloud is made possible by
Google's PlanetScale infrastructure. To ensure you are successful, our infrastructure
delivers several key diﬀerentiated beneﬁts, including a global network construct,
performant and customizable compute services and reliable and secure storage.
First, at the core of this infrastructure is the world's largest and lowest latency
network with 27 regions, 82 zones and 146 points of presence, located in more than
200 countries, all interconnected with 16 subsea cables. It enables companies like
Major League Baseball, Wayfair and 1-800-Flowers to quickly migrate existingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

Page 30 of 69A - Richard Seroterenterprise workloads to Google Cloud. And we're continuing to invest in our global
network and global reach. This year alone, we have already added four new cloud
regions: Warsaw, Delhi, Melbourne, and Toronto.
Moreover, with simpler networking solutions, such as Network Connectivity Center,
you can easily connect SD-WANs, VPNs and Interconnects with a centralized
management model and monitor the network with Network Intelligence Center. And
with Private Service Connect, you can connect at the service layer without
conﬁguring the underlying network.
Second is our performant and customizable compute platform. Compute engine
allows your applications to achieve higher reliability, security and scale, without any
of the operational toil. We've recently announced a new VM family, Tau VMs, which is
optimized for scale-out digital-native workloads. Tau VMs oﬀer 42% higher price
performance than alternatives from any other leading cloud provider.
As of today, I'm also excited to announce the preview release of new Spot VMs.With
Spot VMs, you can use excess compute capacity at deeply discounted rates. And our
new Spot VMs oﬀer better savings and more predictable pricing than alternatives
from any other leading cloud.
Third, our business continuity and storage options. Our strategy is about tailoring
your storage needs to your workload so we can meet your price and performance
needs. To advance our storage as the best option for global enterprises, we had
recently introduced three important new services.
The ﬁrst is backup for GKE, which is an easy cloud-native way for customers to
protect their conﬁguration and data running in their stateful containers. The second
is Filestore Enterprise, our cloud-native managed NFS storage solution that oﬀers
99.99% availability SLA and is ideal for running enterprise applications such as SAP
and GCP. And the third is additional robust business continuity features for cloud
storage, that extends the unique single namespace model we have with dual region
buckets. You now get more choice in where your data is stored with custom dual
region buckets. And the option of a new market-leading 15-minute RPO SLA.
We're passionate about helping customers continually evolve their approach to
modernization and bring more of their applications and data to the cloud. Google
Cloud is PlanetScale, available wherever you need it, while also providing cutting-
edge innovations in performance and security. Our goal is to make your journey to
cloud easy by oﬀering transformative capabilities to help you innovate faster and
save money through an open approach that enables ﬂexibility and choice.
Next, I'm going to turn it over to the demo team to bring the magic of Google Cloud
to life. So stick around. And after the demo, we'll be taking your questions in a live

Hi. I'm Vidya.
We're really glad you joined us here today. We're going to have a lot of fun talking
tech. And I wish you could be here with us personally, but we're live at least. That
means we can kind of say anything. Like I could say, Google should bring back
Google Reader, and I'm still working here. So that's awesome. If you have other hot
takes, you want to share some feedback, put it in the chat. We can see that stuﬀ live
right now. So keep your comment.

If you can't see the live interactivity, please click on the blue Join Live Interactive

those of you just joining us from the spotlight session, you heard about some of our
new product announcements including Anthos for VMs, Anthos Multi-Cloud API, and
the Google Distributed Cloud.
Yes. Awesome. In next 15 minutes, we're actually going to show you all of these in
action, which is great. So here's what we're going to do together. First, we're going
to migrate something, and demonstrate how to get some new value from an old
system by moving VM-based applications to a newer containerized platform. And
we'll start by showing you how to run a legacy happening serverless platform. So
buckle up, Vidya.
{BIO 21475323 <GO>}
Next, we'll create. We'll build a new experience for customers through our AI-
powered software. And then we'll deploy with some brand new deployment tools,
unique to Google Cloud.
Love it. Finally, we're going to be expanding our deployment targets. We're not just
shipping the cloud anymore, but extending that awesome path to production to
other public clouds and even closer to your customers at the edge. All right, let's
switch some things up. Shall we?
I now work at Symbol Shops, probably because I'm a Google Reader crack. So let's
pretend that I am the Director of IT at this company, Symbol Shops. And like many of
you, our global business has been shifted because of increasing demands online.
And at the same time, we have some problems. So old software was never meant for
all the customer load we're putting on it now. It's holding us back. We're trying to

A - Richard Seroterlook, I can't rewrite everything. So how do we reduce some cost and add some
capabilities to that existing software, a little easier without much -- too much eﬀort?
So I want to start with a smart migration approach. I want a repeatable eﬃcient way
to move old systems to newer stuﬀ, maybe even a serverless one. But Symbol Shops
needs help from our trusted partners at Google Cloud. Help, Vidya, you're my only
hope.
{BIO 21475323 <GO>}
I got you, Richard. So our ﬁt assessment tool, which you can see here is initiated from
the Google Cloud console. It helps us understand what can be automatically
migrated and which workloads are going to be most successful in their new home.
It's unique to Google Cloud, and saves you time.
By pointing our migrate service at a set of over 2,000 virtual machines in our on-
prem vSphere environment, we just generated a ﬁt assessment for the workloads
running in each of those VMs.And remember, these VMs could be running on-prem
in Google Cloud, in AWS or in Azure.
So now, let's take a look at the results of the assessment. See here, we have a
graphical view of our most likely candidates for migration. This tool is particularly
good at detecting compatibility for older Java applications like Java EE application
servers. Now that we've assessed, let's migrate.
Using our migrate service, I'm taking a Java app running on WebSphere in an on-
prem VM and generating a container image that can run on any of our container
services, all via automation. And you can see here that the classic Java app is now
served up by our only pay-for-what-you-use, serverless container product, Cloud
Run.
Wow, I love that. So this is great. We'll make sure we know what we just did there. I
mean, I don't have to manage all of these partially utilized virtual machines anymore,
because you containerized it. And I've oﬄoaded some of the operating system
management, I don't have to patch OSs anymore. That's awesome. And you've
actually given me access to brand new functionality and saved me money by running
in a modern platform like Cloud Run. So you just took a classic Java app and ran that
on the serverless platform. It's pretty wild stuﬀ. If you like that, tell us in the chat that
you have a need for putting some of your older systems in these newer platforms.
All right. So next step. Let's create some new value and get that to Google Cloud. So
Symbol Shops has some problems we want to solve. We have a app that tracks some
of the store performance, but it runs in VMs and it needs some serious
modernization to support all of those sort of new customer experiences and can
keep us competitive. So this means upgrading functionality and even changing how
we could deliver it to production. So curbside pickup super hot right now. How do IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

That seems really important. Vidya, I don't know. Can you help me with this one?
{BIO 21475323 <GO>}
Yes, of course. I can. So Richard, what is does current app consist of?
Well, thank you for asking. Our current app has a MongoDB database with multiple
services that track orders and pickups. We actually want to add new services in data
to capture and analyze that curbside pickup info. And to make that happen, we
could look at historical footage from the past day and count the pickups and do
some analysis later.
{BIO 21475323 <GO>}
This looks like a great opportunity to do two things. First, we're going to add Google
Cloud AI to process video footage and capture metrics. Second, we'll containerize
these workloads and put them on a continuous delivery pipeline so that it's easy to
keep making changes.
I like that. So if you do this, then we'd actually know how many customers are doing
curbside pickup, maybe even how long they were waiting. And I think you're going
to ﬁx them on my path to prod and keep it -- make it easy to kind of package and
keep changing the software over and over again. I love that.
{BIO 21475323 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely. Check it out. So Google Cloud Vision API can detect vehicles in this
footage to determine how well curbside pickups have been going at each location.
So now, let's write some code and deploy the updated app to Google Cloud. This is
exciting and I'm hoping all our audience is excited too. I'm using Visual Studio Code
here, but I could easily use IntelliJ or any JetBrains IDE. And using the no-cost cloud
code plug-in, I can easily browse Google Cloud services, add them to my app, and
then code and test this container-based app.
You are the fastest coder I've ever seen. That was remarkable. That was pretty simple
too. I like that. So now that everything is working locally, how would they then deploy
this to the cloud?
{BIO 21475323 <GO>}
Let me show you. First, we need to package up this app into a container. You
probably want your developers spending time writing code, not Dockerﬁles. And we
can help with that. I'll show you how we like to package containers. And while I'm
doing that, audience, tell us how do you package your containers. So here is ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

up.
Awesome.
{BIO 21475323 <GO>}
So Cloud Build is a serverless build tool that many customers use for continuous
integration. The (inaudible) now support industry standard cloud buildpacks to
package up our app into a container image automatically and push it to Artifact
Registry. Artifact Registry stores your container images in regional repositories. And
here, you see that we automatically scan for vulnerabilities.
That's the -- what else do we use Artifact Registry for? This is -- I haven't seen as
much about that. Can you tell me a little bit about that?
{BIO 21475323 <GO>}
Yes. So while we use Artifact Registry for storing Docker container images, Richard,
we can also use it for storing all your language-speciﬁc artifacts in one place. For
instance, we just went GA with Java, Node.js and Python packages using the maven
NPM and PyPI repository formats, respectively.
That's pretty cool. So while we're waiting for the poll results, looking at some of the
chat, I saw some questions about how do we do day 2 management of migrated
workloads. I think the migrate tooling gives you a container image that now I could
download to my desktop, I can run in diﬀerent places. I have diﬀerent ways to run
that.
Some other questions about -- again, thinking about how do we migrate to GKE and
Cloud Run. I think these tools are pretty cool that they can actually take an app and
run it in either one, which is pretty great. And I think we're seeing the poll results
come in.
{BIO 21475323 <GO>}
Yes. It looks like the results are in. And it's amazing that a lot of folks are already
automating today. And they're automating the adorkable commands in CI pipeline.
That's excellent.
So now that we have a container in the registry, I think it's time to deploy it. So to
deploy your app, let's use the new Google Cloud Deploy Service, a continuous
delivery service for deploying containerized workloads. While the service is
containerized and could run in GKE or Cloud Run, the app is fairly coupled to ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

strategy.
So let's target one of our GKE Autopilot clusters. GKE Autopilot is the fully managed
Kubernetes service, where Google Cloud provisions, scales, upgrades and
troubleshoots the cluster for me. Here we see a deployment pipeline that helps us
manage release candidates and environments. Cloud Deploy helps us manage
promotion and roll-out across these environments. And once the app is deployed to
GKE Autopilot, you can start using it from each retail store that you have. You kick
this all oﬀ with a push to get and also you manually approve ﬁnal promotion to
production. In fact, I'm going to have someone drop the URL in the chat window now
so that you can see it for yourself, it all works just like magic.
That's cool. It must be true. You put the link there, that's great. So it's awesome. So
from development to packaging deployment, I mean I think personally this is the
best set of integrated tools for services and building containers that I've seen. So I
think that's awesome. So we're also seeing some other folks in the chat talking about
some of these components as well and what they're seeing for migrating the apps
and hopefully clicking links and trying to break the app we just deployed.
All right. So now that we've just taken that existing app, we added AI functionality,
we dramatically changed the knowledge that each of our stores has about the
customer experience. That's pretty cool.
{BIO 21475323 <GO>}
Indeed. Isn't it, Richard? What else do you want to throw my way?
I think we got some time. So we've acquired a few other retail chains who use
diﬀerent clouds. I mean, nobody's perfect, right? So at the same time, this app needs
to run in more places so the each of those stores can analyze curbside pickup
behavior, regardless of what cloud they're using. So I guess, Vidya, my question for
you is, how do I run this app everywhere?
{BIO 21475323 <GO>}
Yes. That's a great question, Richard. And we do have a solution for consistency
across any environment. Check out how we do it through Anthos. With the new
multi-cloud API, we can provision these clusters right from the Google Cloud CLI or
console in other clouds, including AWS and Azure, where you already have some
applications installed.
See here, that I'm using a single G-cloud command to create a GKE cluster on Azure.
Here we have deployed GKE clusters to Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. I'm
managing it all from Google Cloud and I'm even able to centrally deploy and view
workloads to any of these GKE clusters.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

A - Unidentiﬁed SpeakerThat's wild. Thanks, Vidya. So you're actually putting GKE, I think it's the best
Kubernetes in the public cloud, anywhere I wanted. I mean that's really powerful
stuﬀ, I love that new Azure support. And again, each store manager, whatever cloud
they're using, can actually see a report at the end of the day to know how they
performed on curbside pickup. That was the goal.
All right. But now you're making me think that we could probably even do more,
right? We could expand some of our thinking here and maybe respond to the
customer demands in real time. Could we actually evolve from that after the fact
analysis of parking lot footage to maybe improve the experience in the real time? By
that, I'm thinking of, could I run this AI model against live camera footage instead of
recorded stuﬀ, and maybe be able to do something with it as it happens?
But of course, as always new challenges emerge, if we think of something like this.
So oﬀ the top of my head, we'd have to somehow customize this AI model, right?
Because now I have to identify the number of cars in motion, how many are waiting,
is the curbside lot picking up. And I probably want to operationalize that model and
move it closer to the store because I'm processing data in real time, so latency
matters. And then I want to integrate all that insight I'm getting with the existing in-
store systems for the managers to use so they can move their employees around. So
that's a lot of stuﬀ. I don't know. Can you help me with that?
{BIO 21475323 <GO>}
We can. So I'm calling in my colleague, Gabrielle[ph]. He has been working with one
of your on-prem locations, Richard, in Austin. And he can explain how we improve
your software for edge scenarios. Hi, Gabrielle.
Hi, Vidya. And hello, everyone. Glad to join you, Richard. By the way, congrats on
new role in Symbol. What you're asking for, can we solve the newly announced
Google Distributed Cloud in the edge. As such you mentioned, it brings the best of
Google Cloud to the edge. It consists of a fully managed CPU, GPU optimized
platform with a common set of Google and third-party applications. You build once
and deploy anywhere. As an example here at some of your stores. So let's get going.
We're going to add real-time intelligence with AI models, and process the data
locally to reduce video latency. Let's get these running on the edge in each store. So
we start out by ﬁrst using Google Vertex AI. So we train the engines and the Vision AI
objects recognition and classiﬁcation models in the central cloud.
Here, we are monitoring the progress and accuracy of the model. And as you can
see, the trained models cannot be packaged into container images, right? Those
container images can be ready to be deployed anywhere including at the edge. In
this case we will be targeting ﬁve diﬀerent Symbol stores. From the Google console,
we can choose the Kubernetes clusters running at speciﬁc edge locations across allFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

A - Richard Seroterthe Symbol stores. Once we pick those clusters, we can deploy the Vision AI mode
that we created to each edge in the store, and manage those edge clusters just like
any other GKE clusters.
The Symbol operations team has the same familiar experience. Only now, Symbol
can also leverage the GPU-optimized Google Distributed Cloud to achieve better
performance and lower latency.
And as if we manage service, distributed cloud comes with the same integrated
Google Cloud operation and management capabilities that you're used to. Here,
Symbol can monitor the health and state of their store deployments, manage
capacity scale, all of these using a familiar Google console and backed by Google
SRE practices.
So as you can see in the video here, our real-time analysis of curbside plant service
level from the live footage led to real-time insights for Symbol Shops to build a
better customer experience at each store. Speciﬁcally, this new model at the edge is
recognizing cars in motion, telling you when the curbside pickup rows are ﬁlling up,
all execute in real time. So what do you think, Richard? Back to you.
This is great. You're amazing, Gabrielle. And that's -- I can't believe you built all that
all by yourself. So this actually gives all our store managers really new insight into the
real-time customer experience, letting those stores allocate staﬀ and people based
on real-time customer demand. That's awesome.
So for the audience out there, I'm actually interested, what sort of apps do you think
about running at the edge? Is that a real use case you're considering? What sort of
things might run there?
All right. So I do love what you built for me. I don't want to be greedy, but I want a
little more. This app isn't an island, right? You're doing some cool AI containerized
based stuﬀ, but there's a lot of things already at that store location, right? Our
notiﬁcation services, other back oﬃce. It's all in VMs.So now that we have to
integrate our new AI customer service app, these VM-based systems, am I signing up
for completely diﬀerent management experiences across containers and virtual
machines or can you do something for me?
Absolutely not. We're going to provide you the same experience with the new
Anthos for VMs.We can actually help you bring those virtual machines into the
Anthos platform and manage them the same way we manage containers. So see
here, that I've moved a set of virtual machines on the Anthos management, which
now gives me a straightforward way to move and modernize existing apps at the
edge.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

A - Richard SeroterWell, it's awesome. There's nothing you can't do, Gabrielle. That's great. So what's
powerful here is that all the Google power ﬂeet management in Google Cloud,
other clouds, at the edge is all based on Anthos with one open control plane for
wherever those workloads run. This simpliﬁes our operations a lot or that open
foundation makes hiring developers and operators a heck of a lot easier.
All right. So last challenge for you. Symbol has this growing European presence, but
some of those regional stores operate with some restrictions on data sovereignty. I
don't want to sacriﬁce all the amazing development and management capabilities
that you and Vidya have showed me today. So is this a lost cause or do you have
something for me?
Yes. We have something for you. And as we announced yesterday, with the new
Google Distributed Cloud hosted, we can use a single hardware and software stack
from Google Cloud. But now with local compute and in local control plane, it runs
not only our container and VM workloads but also the data and application services
we care about. You could run this, as an example, in the regional hoster fully air-
gapped, and have local stores connect directly to that, one open modern platform
from wherever you want to operate.
I'm sold. You've done it. So it's pretty cool. So same Anthos control plane tech, but
also local services in this fully air-gapped setting. That's great stuﬀ. Thanks, Gabrielle.

well. Over the last 15 minutes, we have shown you how Google Cloud oﬀers a world-
class experience for building new software or modernizing what you have. Our
solutions for container-based apps are second to none. And we're now making it
possible to extend those terriﬁc services to wherever you need us to be.
All right. Thank you all for joining us, Vidya, Gabrielle as well. This was terriﬁc stuﬀ.
And thank you out there for the chat and the engagement. It was awesome to see
that. So now, stay tuned for the live Q&A coming up next. We're going to talk about
everything from the spotlight, all the way through to this demo, get your questions in
there, and we'll be answering it live. Thanks so much. Bye-bye.

A - Sachin GuptaAll right. Hi. It's me again. In case you didn't tune in for that live demo that just
wrapped up, I'm Richard.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
And I'm Sachin. Richard, it was nice to see you in your new role. Symbol Shops'
demo captain.
Yes. Thanks for hiring me back. I'm glad to be back. So our friends from the live
demo are going to be sticking around to answer any of the questions you may have.
So you may see their faces throughout this show as well. So let's just jump right in,
with a little poll. What gets you ﬁred up about tech, using serverless platforms,
running GKE anywhere? How about continuously building software or even just
having breakfast or dinner? Put your results in there. I'd love to see what you have to
say.
So while we wait for that, a reminder. This Q&A is completely live, you can engage
with us directly. Ask your questions. Say hi in the chat. Yell at us, certainly Sachin, not
me. I'm doing my best. If you can't though, go back to the Next event website, click
on that blue Joint Interactive Experience button and we'll wait for you over here.
All right. Now time for some poll results. Let's see what we have. Anything coming in
so far. What do we think ﬁres people up? What ﬁres you up, Sachin?
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Look, besides breakfast or dinner, it's all about Google Distributed Cloud. And the
ability to have that consistent management, run anywhere, meeting our customers
where they're at, fully managed solutions is just absolutely incredible. And what
Gabrielle has showed up there with Vidya, that was just fantastic.
Yes. That's a big deal. Well, looking at the results so far, you all are just animals,
eating breakfast or dinner. So good job.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
I was right.
Yes. Do whatever, live your life. That's great. So let's get started with our ﬁrst
question. This one comes from Jessica[ph]. So when would I use Anthos on bare
metal infrastructure versus that Google Distributed Cloud at edge? How do I make a
decision between the two?

A - Vidya Nagarajan RamanYes. That's a great question. Thanks for that question. So, ﬁrst of all, let me just go
back to that Symbol Shops retail example. If you're a customer, you have your own
hardware, it's customized for that environment perhaps, and you're just looking for a
stack on top to run. Anthos bare metal is a great option. But if you're a customer
where you just want to consume the whole stack, hardware, software-as-a-service,
and you want to leave all that complexity to us, then the Google Distributed Cloud
product is a great solution for that. And so we want to be very ﬂexible about it. You
get to choose based on what your needs are.
So it's nice to have software-based option or the software and hardware --
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Exactly. Because diﬀerent customer -- same customer, we have two use cases as well.
But the same control plane.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
But the same control plane, same experience. Deploy right ones, build ones, deploy
anywhere.
Yes, that's a big deal. So this one is going to be for you, Sachin, as well. We're just
going to pummel you with questions to start with. So this one comes from Mike. So --
or no, Val's asking this question. Let's switch questions up. This one's going to go to
Vidya. I'll give you a breather.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Okay. Sounds good.
You worry out on that one. So Vidya, this one's for you. Are there other managed
services that people might want to adopt as they become more cloud-native? What
do they start picking up as they start making this move to cloud?
{BIO 21475323 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely, Richard. So as you deploy more microservices, you can easily
leverage our fully managed serverless orchestration products, like Workﬂows or
Eventarc, so that you can connect as well as coordinate Google Cloud services, such
as Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, HTTP-based API services including third-party
services, so that you can tie them all up into serverless workﬂows. And this really
helps you address those type of use cases, which require business-critical, mission-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

observability built in so that everything actually executes reliably and ﬂawlessly.
Love it. Thank you very much, Vidya. Good. Next one, this one is for you, Sachin,
buckle up here. So Robert from Liberty Mutual is asking us about kind of the OS
support for Anthos. So when I think about -- we know Anthos supports Windows and
Linux, which is great. So he's curious about what ﬂavors of Linux will support AIX? So
where are we at on some of the operating systems?
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
This -- the Anthos support we have is consistent with Anthos that you have from a
software-only point of view. So with Google Distributed Cloud, we just carry it
forward. And what we're doing is we're certifying that solution on top of hardware
that we've prescribed. And I think there was a question that I was seeing in chat
which is about, hey, what kind of hardware we certiﬁed. So we've gone in, we have
hardware from Dell, from HPE. We've got GPUs from Nvidia. And so it's a diﬀerent
hardware for diﬀerent scenarios. And then on top of that, whatever Anthos provides,
we can bring to bear.
Yes. And for Anthos on bare metal just out of interest, so you can run RHEL, CentOS,
Ubuntu. So we support all of those as well. So we try to give you a good set of
choices there. Awesome. We're throwing more stuﬀ at Sachin. Let's do it.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Okay.
So are you seeing any customer preference so far for GKE Autopilot versus GKE
Standard? GKE Standard is amazing. It's got all the knobs and dials, Autopilot is just
turnkey, ready to go. Are you seeing any change in preferences?
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
First of all, we've seen massive adoption of GKE Autopilot. So it's really opened the
door, I think, for many, many customers, who wanted to get the beneﬁt of
Kubernetes and containers, but wanted it to be sort of automatically set up for them.
But you still have customers, who don't just want that Kubernetes API, they actually
want -- they have an existing cluster or they have an environment that's ﬁne tuned for
their needs, very, very large scale deployments where GKE works great. And so I
think with the combination of GKE and GKE Autopilot, we can now cater to any of
those needs.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

A - Sachin GuptaYes. I think -- so we looked at the data, we've actually seen a lot of Autopilot
customers are just new Google Cloud customers as well, as a great ﬁrst foray into
Kubernetes.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Exactly. They can get going so quickly. I mean again, the demos that were showed
just now were fantastic, right?
Yes, even I can use it. Yes, it's great stuﬀ.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Exactly.
More stuﬀ for you, Sachin. This was coming from Jude[ph]. So how do I choose
which container-oriented compute service to use? Now we don't necessarily have
the 17 ways that other clouds oﬀer, we have maybe few or more focused services, but
there's still choices, not just one way to run container. So how should someone make
some decisions there?
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Yes. So I think -- look, we do try to keep it simple, but there are some choices. If you
have something that's compute-heavy, where it's a lot of self-managed software that
you have, self-managed services that you're creating, it could be that you have your
own databases, it could be a middleware messaging. That's where we think GKE is
best.
But if you're a consumer of a lot of the managed services and you've got some
adjacent code that complements those services, then Cloud Run is fantastic. And so,
again, not the 17 choices like you mentioned, but there are a few choices based on
how you're using that containerized environment.
Yes, that's a crisp way of thinking about it. Good stuﬀ. All right. Spencer is asking us,
Anthos for VMs is interesting, we announced that and it seems wild. We've been just
talking containers all this time. Now we're talking VMs.So when the world is the use
case for that, why would I think about having Anthos manage virtual machines?
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Great question once again. And look, again, we've been ruber[ph] clear about this.
We want to meet customers where they're at. And while customers are looking to
modernize and want to be on GKE -- on Kubernetes containerized, they do have
some software components, some applications that require a VM environment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

A - Richard Seroter
A - Sachin GuptaAnd so the ability to have that one consistent management plane and have the sort
of lowered cost of running VMs or containers on top of Kubernetes, that's a very
powerful combination. So Anthos for VMs is just to make sure that while they're
looking to modernize, whatever pieces of software that they have, that requires that
VM environment, they can bring it along consistently as they do the transition.
Yes. It seems powerful against ﬂat and maybe the operational toolchain, just treat the
VMs containers the same way that are really going to simplify hiring, just
management, those sorts of things.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Exactly. And if the VMs go away at some point, great. If they're going to be there
running next to the containers, that's great. But that consistency of management
reduces the operational cost.
Yes. That's great call. This one's going to go to Vidya. So Alex is asking us about
Cloud Run. And look, this is something that we talk a lot about. We love Cloud Run.
Cloud Run is terriﬁc. So what's new and interesting there? Like what's been
happening in the Cloud Run world?
{BIO 21475323 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks, Richard. So here are some new features that might be interesting.
Number one, to further secure your Cloud Run environment, which has been GA
with binary authorization so that you can deploy your trusted container images.
Number two, you can now run even more workloads, for instance, workloads that
may need background processing. And we oﬀered additional always-on CPU
allocation controls, which comes with new pricing. There are no request fees.
Memory and CPU is priced about 25% lower. The third feature that might be
interesting to call out is that while Cloud Run free tier continues to exist, we also now
recently introduced committed use discounts, so that you can actually get up to 17%
discount for over a year with one-year commitment.
That's great. Awesome. Thanks, Vidya. Yes, I think some of that committed use stuﬀ is
terriﬁc, same with the security features. I mean Cloud Run is one of the best security-
oriented just container runtimes out there in addition with GKE.
Also another question. This one's coming in for you again, Sachin, I'm glad you're
ready. Vladimir[ph] is asking us, what is the beneﬁt of doing Anthos Edge versus
Anthos on VMware? I know those are even diﬀerent, I guess, to start with if we think
about the question, could you do on VMware at the edge? How do you think about
then our Distributed Cloud Edge? I guess kind of help demystify this.

A - Sachin Gupta
A - Richard SeroterIf I think about the question, it feels a little bit similar to the previous question, which
is, what are you actually trying to do. If you're actually trying to modernize, then the
Anthos environment, where we provide that simple management plane built on
Kubernetes, where you can run containerized applications, but you can also run VMs
now. That's a -- you're on a path to modernization and that's what you're looking for.
You're looking for operational cost reduction, simpliﬁcation, but you want to be into
the sort of new world in the containerized world. That's where that wins. And so --
but there are going to be other options on-prem that you can run.
And then similar to perhaps other solutions that may be out there, where it's not just
a software layer, you can package the hardware and the software completely
together. That's where Google Distributed Cloud that's built on Anthos comes
together. So a real question, are you looking to modernize? Is it just a pure legacy
environment that that's how it's going to remain? If you're looking to modernize and
you need the ﬂexibility of having VMs as well, Anthos and Anthos for VMs is perfect.
Yes. And if you have a VMware footprint at the edge already, then obviously we can
run right on top of that. And everything is amazing. So again, I like the ﬂexibility that -
- we'll work with what we have.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
And look, if you want to run that VMware footprint inside Google Cloud in our
regions, for that you have Google Cloud VMware engine, and we support that. And
so we're very ﬂexible based on what customers are trying to achieve.
Yes. Awesome. Another one for you, Sachin. This one, I think, is interesting. So I
thought Anthos was already multi-cloud. Whether we're talking about the multi-
cloud API when we're already doing that or what's new with a multi-cloud API?
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Yes. Anthos, look has been multi-cloud for over a year now, right? And so the multi-
cloud API is really about instead of having to bring up your clusters, your GKE
clusters and the control plane as well in every single cloud, you can now just run that
control plane in Google Cloud, and then manage those clusters that may be sitting
in AWS or Azure or somewhere else in a very, very simple way through that same
control plane. And so it's further simplifying how you deploy those clusters and how
you manage them and bringing you the power of GKE and Anthos together.
Yes. No, I love that demo of just showing a single G-cloud command. Because for
someone today, you could deploy Anthos on AWS, but you'd ﬁrst stand up that
management cluster, and it's been up user clusters. It wasn't hard, but can I just
simplify that, can we take more responsibility. And it looks like we have. So I think it's
really just a simpliﬁcation story. Awesome.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 45 of 69A - Sachin Gupta
A - Richard Seroter
A - Sachin GuptaThis one is for me somehow. So awesome. So how do I choose between GKE
Autopilot and Cloud Run?
Look, Autopilot is amazing. It feels like serverless Kubernetes, right? And that's why
it's kind of magic on how that behaves. And it's still all Kubernetes in their covers.
There's no goofy extra extension stuﬀ, this is just GKE. Cloud Run is also kind of a
serverless environment.
So when you look at the diﬀerence between the two, really it's about -- to some
extent, do I want Kubernetes, if I'm deploying marketplace oﬀerings, I'm deploying a
database, I'm deploying stateful workloads, Autopilot is going to be amazing there,
right? So that one is pretty powerful. And at the same time, if I'm in Cloud Run, and
as you mentioned earlier, I've got a lot of managed services, I'm using Spanner, I'm
using Pub/Sub, I'm doing AI/ML and I'm putting some code in the gaps to connect
the dots to add some API endpoints, Cloud Run is amazing.
So I don't know, I think when I look at this and we look at customers, it's often case
where if I want Kubernetes, GKE is clearly a great choice. If I'm building compute
intense systems, as you mentioned earlier, GKE is amazing and Autopilot is
awesome. And when I'm just trying to run some containers and I'm building things
that kind of connect dots between other managed services, Cloud Run is best in
class.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Yes. It just depends on your starting point, I guess, right?
Yes. But again, not too many choices, but just enough. Awesome. There is another
one for Sachin. This one's coming from the Ford Motor company folks. Is Anthos
open source? Is there any support available? Is this just DIY, live your life, are we
actually behind the product helping people, there's commercial oﬀering? Help clear
that up.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Yes. So ﬁrst of all, in terms of open source, it's built on Kubernetes. And so built on
open source components, for sure. It enables our ﬁrst-party software on top but also
third-party open source software that can run in that containerized or VM
environment.
As far as support, it's been -- we now have more and more partners, more and more
customers trained on Anthos. Anthos is the foundation of Google Distributed Cloud
as well. And so we continue to invest heavily to ensure that the training, the
enablement, the skills, the capabilities get built up in our customers, in our partners
to continue and support those deployments. I don't know, if you want to add to that
on some of the answers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

A - Vidya Nagarajan RamanNo, it's a great answer. I mean we see so many people take all this amazing open
source and build platforms, which can be powerful. And Anthos is actually 30-
something-odd open source projects, that come into one curated, integrated, tested,
packaged commercial product, as you say. And the multi-cloud support is the best
eﬀort. We test this and certify it on Azure, on Amazon, on-prem, on bare metal. So I
think that's pretty powerful stuﬀ that I know some people can still get a little bit, like
what in the world is Anthos? And I think it's important for us to remind people that,
Anthos is really a way to build and manage distributed ﬂeets of infrastructure. And
so what a powerful way to do that in a supported fashion from the folks who created
it.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Hybrid multi-cloud with hardware, software together. I mean, yes.
How do I manage a bunch of GKE clusters all over the place? That's a really
powerful, hopeful, simple way to understand this sort of the thing.
Yes. Have you continued to see that uptick as well in Anthos? I know we're starting to
see some of the growth there. Are you happy with where things are going?
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely. Yes, we continue to see great customer traction. And now with more
as-a-service solutions with Anthos, Anthos for VMs, Anthos for bare metal, continue
to meet customers where they're at.
Putting it in distributed cloud, is a powerful story for customers, because again I can
make one investment in my skills, and now I can take advantage of this in a lot of
places.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Yes.
Awesome. So next we want to go to Vidya with this, giving for Sachin a breather. And
so Fabian[ph] is asking, what the -- with everything -- containers are all over the
place. Should I just opt for Cloud Run instead of App Engine? What's the future of
App Engine in this context? I like these edgy questions. Vidya, what do you got for
me?
{BIO 21475323 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 47 of 69A - Richard Seroter
A - Sachin Gupta
A - Richard Seroter
A - Sachin GuptaYes. So App Engine is obviously a very successful product for us at Google and
serverless. However, we see containers as very, very strong positioned for the future
of development as you could see with all the demos that we had and with what
technologies such as Cloud Run as well as GKE Autopilot that has come into play, it
has got the beneﬁts of portability and better integrations with the rest of GCP as well
as the cloud. So that's the way we look at it.
It seems like a good answer. I mean, Google Cloud's got a lot of these stable
services, a lot of customers on App Engine, but it's nice to have alternates as people
are looking for other integrations, things like that. Cloud Run is -- continue to be a
big investment. That's awesome.
Sachin, this one's for you. Security questions. I mean, I was personally impressed with
a lot of -- and enjoyed a lot of the keynotes from yesterday as we looked at all the
investments we're making in security here. Like if you're trying to make a choice on
security, I think Google Cloud is your best choice, and not just because I work here.
But how secure are some of these clusters out of the box? We're thinking about --
and I'm assuming this refers to Anthos. When we stick either an Anthos cluster or
GKE cluster oﬀ-prem, or even just a GKE cluster sitting in Google Cloud, how do you
think about the security story, and how secure is this by default?
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
By default, what we're trying to do is turn on all the best practices that we
recommend so that the communication channel that you described is secure. If
customers want to manage that with their own keys, they can. But we want to make
sure that all the best practices, so that if it's the days in transit, the days in rest, that
by default we can keep that on for customers. I mean, you should add some more
Anthos-speciﬁc maybe security capabilities that we turn on.
Yes. As you say, there's a lot of important things around OS hardening, how we
distribute bits, they're coming from us, you can trust that as well, that we're putting
them through the paces. But then with Autopilot, arguably, one of the best parts of
Autopilot as we just enable all the security stuﬀ by default, right? Because I don't
know what I'm doing as an end user myself when I send up stuﬀ. So if you're turning
on the right sort of encryption at rest settings, you're turning on the right role-based
access, you're turning based on continual updates for patching. I think that's pretty
awesome. So in a lot of these cases, we're defaulting to secure.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
I think one of the other questions we get is, how do you handle this then in the air
gap environment, right? So now, like how does the customer get software updates?
How do they make those secure? And so what we do is we take that software, we
publish it to a repository. The customer is able to download it outside their air gap,
check it for any vulnerabilities, test it out on their own, and then move it into the air
gap, and then the platform will automatically deploy it. And so these some additionalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

privacy needs, that need to be able to check any piece of software that's coming
down.
Powerful stuﬀ. All right, last question for you. I could ask you questions all day, but
I'm being told I have to ask you a last question.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Okay.
So John wants to know as well. So I'm assuming this refers to Distributed Cloud.
Whose Hardware is this? And who does it run on? And do you manage the hardware
platform as well? Let's at least refer the Distributed Cloud. Are we managing the
hardware? Is it coming from Google? Are we making the kits or is it coming from
partners? Lay that out for us real quick.
{BIO 20660275 <GO>}
Yes. So we are -- it's prescriptive hardware that we provide and we manage. And so
in terms of how it's supported, again, that's done through us. We can do this through
partners as well. And so what happens is in a -- for example, in an air gap in the
hosted mode, you may need to have a trusted partner, customer may want a trusted
partner who's actually doing the operations in terms of, hey, I'm adding a rack or
adding more hardware components. But the software that we provide manages that
hardware infrastructure that's deployed on-prem. And the beauty of it is the control
plane there is completely disconnected from Google Cloud as well. So you have
both those options. The edge mode where it's connected, we can do it centrally
across many sites or hosted where that control plane is local, but we still manage the
hardware.
Super powerful stuﬀ. Love that. So thank you, Sachin. Thanks to all of our guests who
we threw questions to on the demo set. So it's been awesome hearing from you all,
getting all that feedback. Make sure to hop over to the Cloud Next site, and stay

{BIO 19013276 <GO>}
Hi, there. Thanks for all that participation in our Q&A. And I hope you're enjoying the
show. So, welcome to the security spotlight. My name is Sunil Potti, and I'm the VP
and GM for Google Cloud Security.
Over the last few months, we've seen some of the most damaging cyber attacks in
history against public utilities, private sector companies, government agencies,
causing many organizations to realize they're at a pivotal moment in their securityFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 49 of 69journey. Of course, this is not news to most of you in our industry, but let me put a
few things in context with a sobering statistic.
Did you know that the cost of cyber crime is now estimated between $2 trillion and
$10 trillion a year? For the past two decades, Google has made security the
cornerstone of our strategy. This has resulted in Google enabling more users to be
safe than anyone else in the world, blocking malware, phishing attempts, spam,
cyber attacks globally, and not just for a few thousands of websites, but for billions of
users and millions of websites globally.
So that being said, we also realized that this journey will require enduring
commitment over the coming years. And that's why Google is committed to invest
$10 billion over the next ﬁve years to help strengthen cybersecurity for enterprises,
consumers and governments. We want you to be able to use our Google Cloud
Security magic to protect your enterprise. We make that possible in two ways. First,
we provide the industry's most trusted cloud for accelerating your digital
transformation eﬀorts. And secondly, we bring trust to you with security products
that meet you where you are and bring our Google Security magic to your on-prem,
private and multi-cloud environments. And it's just not about having best-in-class
security capabilities, it's also about how they're actually delivered in a consumerized
fashion.
But at Google Cloud, we take a diﬀerent approach. We are driven by a vision of
invisible security, where security technologies are engineered in so you get
opinionated, full-stack coverage of security controls, security operations as the silo
disappears, so niche security talent gets democratized. And last but quite
signiﬁcantly, shared responsibility in a world of public cloud evolves to shared fate,
where we, as your provider, have true skin in the game and mutual security
outcomes. So a great example of what I mean by invisible security is the all-new
built-in data protection, automatic DLP for BigQuery. It's a game-changing capability
that discovers and classiﬁes sensitive data for all of our BQ projects across your
entire org without you needing to do a single thing.
And we take a full step back and internalize what invisible security could mean for
you. As an enterprise, a service provider, a partner, whoever it is, there are three
areas where Google's insight and experience can make a make a meaningful
diﬀerence. One, protecting your employees and assets. Two, protecting your IP.
Three, protecting your users and your brand. Let me spend a bit of time on each of
these.
First, one of the most overused buzzwords in cyber security today is zero trust. Why
not? The core of a zero trust approach is the idea that implicit trust in any single
component of a complex interconnected system can create serious security risks.
What does that mean, is that trust needs to be established via multiple mechanisms
and be veriﬁed continuously. So here at Google, we've applied a zero trust approach
to most aspects of our operations. We've implemented zero trust access with our
BeyondCorp framework, shared our used case with the entire world and deliveredFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 50 of 69BeyondCorp Enterprise, a world-class solution that includes integrated threat and
data protection.
We've had great reception to BeyondCorp Enterprise since the launch earlier this
year. And today, we're delivering capabilities that expand the surface area for zero
trust access to cover all of your apps, both modern as well as legacy. So as a point of
note, right after this session, the team will be doing a live end-to-end demo of
BeyondCorp Enterprise to show how you can make access easier and more secure,
the Google way. So don't miss it.
Next, protecting your assets is easier if it's intentionally done upstream, shifting
security left. And so, zero trust goes beyond access to protecting your workloads as
well and your IP. And how Google operates our production environment is in this
way: the way software is conceived, produced, managed and interacts with other
software. We call our approach BeyondProd and we've already productized many
capabilities for you.
So, looking at BeyondCorp and BeyondProd, you realize that zero trust is much more
than tools. Zero trust is how we envision designing, deploying and operating safe
environments, so our daily lives as an enterprise or consumer can go from a world of
being on the edge to being safe and safer with Google. But you can lose sight of the
fact that while zero trust approach has helped address the preventative side of your
program, robust detection and response capabilities are needed to complete the
equation. And this is why we invest in Chronicle and we continue to amplify it as our
foundational security operation solution. And we are excited to announce stronger
integration between Chronicle and Security Command Center, SCC on GCP, with
centralization of alerts, the addition of Cloud Asset Inventory Management and user
context to enrich investigations.
Next, let's talk a little bit about protecting your intellectual property. So for
organizations pursuing digital transformation, code is your IP, which is the heart of
your business. The foundation of securing your code is a secure software supply
chain, from the time developers start writing code through your CI/CD pipeline, all
the way to deploying and operating in production. So at Google Cloud, we believe
two things are foundationally necessary for doing this in an enduring fashion: one,
industry-wide frameworks and standards are a must, but they also need to be
complemented by full-stack managed services that implement these standards and
make adoption easy. So, for the ﬁrst, Google co-founded OpenSSF across the
industry forum for open source and supply chains software security and with projects
such as SLSA, an end-to-end framework for ensuring the integrity of software
artifacts.
And second, we have the AllStar, GitHub App, right in time for the fall season for
continuous enforcement of best practices for GitHub projects. And then last but not
least, Open Source Scorecards, which provide risk score for open source projects.
And these are just a few ways Google is contributing to industry-wide standards. And
on Google Cloud, with our invisible security approach, we provide these tools in aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

implement these standards by default.
And let's not forget, you also get a consistent way to deﬁne and enforce policy for a
zero trust software supply chain that establishes provenance and prevents
modiﬁcation or tampering. And we're building this zero trust software supply chain
with new additions across the board, you can learn more about all of these launches
in our breakout sessions.
So to add some more context to this with new voices in our conversation on these
topics, I'd like to bring on Murray from Facebook and Steph who leads our Cloud
Security User Experience team. Steph and Murray, over to you.
{BIO 17699674 <GO>}
Thanks, Sunil. And welcome, Murray. Can you tell us about your role at Facebook
and what that work entails?
Sure. I'm a manager supporting the Cloud Foundation team within Facebook. Cloud
Foundation is chartered to help teams with a need to use public clouds for their
workloads so that they can do so both quickly and safely.
{BIO 17699674 <GO>}
Can you talk about how Facebook is leveraging zero trust, secure supply chains or
other modern cybersecurity solutions?
Facebook focuses a lot of engineering eﬀort on secure supply chains. This extends to
our use of the cloud as well. So, our workloads that will run externally have all of the
same requirements as the internal ones in terms of security, vulnerability
management, security logging, monitoring, tight access control to resources, access
auditing, data deletion requirements, penetration testing, mandatory reviews of
anything with privacy implications and so on.
One approach we're taking is that our teams can't use any UIs or directly control the
services they build in the cloud. They have to go through our tool suite to do it.
Some of our suite uses open source -- common open source tools, which means
there are vast online help resources available to enable our teams to design and
build their services. Then we provide our own extensions so that these tools
integrated with our existing internal development workﬂows, logging systems,
dashboards, et cetera. It also allows us to impose our own guardrails and best
practices. Its infrastructure is code in its truest sense.
Naturally, we already have an internal CI/CD system, that's used to update our
internal services on a regular basis after appropriate code reviews and automated
testing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

So I'd love to wrap up by hearing about your experiences. What your team uses to
keep Facebook fortiﬁed and continually strengthen its security posture? And two,
partnering.
One of the capabilities that our tool chain allows is to inspect what the deployment is
going to do before it happens, which gives us an opportunity to impose best
practices or error checking and stop problems from going live. Some of these rules
shield us from accidental security exposures, some look for weak deployment
practices such as a lack of redundancy and still others look for avoidably expensive
practices. These rules applied here are based on both our own experiences and
policies and those recommended by our expert partner team supporting us. This
allows us to be agile and respond to incidents when they come to our attention.
{BIO 19013276 <GO>}
Thanks, Murray and Steph. Interesting to see how these ideas are implemented and
I'm excited to see where we'll continue to go together.
Okay. So let's move beyond our infrastructure for a moment and think about the big
picture. The software that runs your business delivers value to your customers and
your users. The security you are building is designed to protect the users and build
trust between them and you. Security incidents erode that trust and eventually
damage your brand. So now Google keeps more users safe online than anyone else
on the world. So let's see how we are advancing our eﬀorts and delivering all these
capabilities to enterprises wherever you are, eradicating phishing as well as
completely stopping fraud, period.
And in this area, safe browsing is the gold standard. Our program to protect users
from dangerous sites or ﬁles is unprecedented in its reach and capability. Its
capabilities are invisibly baked into browsers on 4 billion plus devices. Last year
alone, we advanced the state-of-the-art with enhanced safe browsing, an optional
but more advanced level of safe -- security for safe browsing the web. And by
sharing real-time browsing data in a privacy-preserving way, we were able to deliver
a 35% additional reduction in phishing attacks and malware that reach users.
These kinds of numbers and this kind of eﬃcacy has not been possible without
leaning in on our heritage and our core competencies in providing security as a
built-in capability to consumers as well as enterprises wherever they are. And since
its introduction in April 2020, in addition to safe browsing, millions of users have
taken advantage of this extra protection in a very rapid fashion. So our ultimate goal
is to eliminate phishing as a threat, period. Bringing safe browsing capabilities into
your environment through Gmail, BeyondCorp Enterprise and many other products.
So in addition to targeting users directly, attackers view websites as the ﬁrst and
often easiest place to commit fraud. And over 5 million sites today use reCAPTCHA,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 53 of 69A - Brian Lozada

A - Phil Venablesour fraud and bot management solution that stops attacks like credential stuﬃng
and account takeovers. With reCAPTCHA Enterprise, you can do this frictionlessly
without user challenges to maintain an optimal user experience, which is just another
example of invisible security. And over and above this, we continue to bring
together the best of Google's capabilities to enhance fraud prevention. So a new
integration between Cloud Armor and reCAPTCHA Enterprise that detects and stops
bot activity at the edge is now in preview.
So let's hear more from Brian Lozada, the CISO at HBO Max, on how they're actually
using reCAPTCHA Enterprise to protect their users and therefore their brand.
Thank you, Sunil. We chose reCAPTCHA Enterprise because we wanted to oﬀer our
customers security against malicious actors, while continuing to provide a frictionless
customer experience. With reCAPTCHA Enterprise, we enable our customers
through our login and registration process without requiring them to engage in any
kind of a challenge. It's a win for everyone. Our development and product
organizations can continue to focus on creating customer centric experiences and
our customers can easily use our services. The use of reCAPTCHA has helped us in
our mission to secure the customer experience allowing our customers to feel
comfortable while enjoying our platform. Thank you.
{BIO 19013276 <GO>}
Thank you, Brian. So we want to provide as much assistance as possible in your
digital transformation or your security transformation. As Thomas mentioned in his
keynote, we are excited to launch our new Google Cybersecurity Action Team to
help. And to talk more about this, I love to kind of bring on Phil Venables, our Cloud
CISO who is leading this eﬀort to tell you more. Phil?
{BIO 20055418 <GO>}
Thanks, Sunil. So the Google Cybersecurity Action Team marshals experts from
across Google to form what we believe will be the world's premier security advisory
team as a singular mission supporting the security and digital transformation of
government, critical infrastructure, enterprises, small businesses, consumers and
society overall. To deliver on this mission, there are many ways the GCAT can help
you today with strategic advisory services for your security strategy, including

and security landscape.
Another way we're working to help strengthen and transform security is by working
with industry and the public sector. Google Cloud joined as an initial partner for the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative, and this
initiative will strengthen our collective security posture by preempting and reducing
the impact of cyber threats through increasingly strong partnerships between the
public and private sectors. And as Sunil mentioned at the White House Cybersecurity
Summit in August, we announced that Google will invest $10 billion over the next ﬁve
years to further strengthen cybersecurity.
The areas addressed included expanding zero trust programs, securing the software
supply chain, enhancing open-source security as well as training 100,000 Americans
in skills including data privacy and security through our Google Career Certiﬁcate
program, and this builds on the $100 million we've already committed to improving
open-source security focused on eﬀorts like Linux kernel development and work like
metrics tracking and the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure through the Open
Source Security Foundation. So with that, Sunil, back to you to wrap up.
{BIO 19013276 <GO>}
Thanks, Phil. Great stuﬀ. As you could see, our commitment to improving security for

Hi, everyone. I'm Marco.
And I'm Tanisha.
In the security spotlight, we heard about the importance of a zero trust approach to
security.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

A - Marco GenoveseAnd in our demo today, we will show you how to implement zero trust access to be
more secure and more productive. And a quick shout-out to our audience, this is
truly live. Dive into the chat, we want to hear from you. Tell us what you do and where
you're joining from. We can see you. Check it out, Marco.
Sure enough. We can see everybody down here, and we're so excited to interact and
talk to you all today. If you're still hanging out in the Next event website, click on the
blue button that says 'Join the Interactive Experience' to activate these features.
Okay, so let's get into it. We're going to cover three things: one, how your entire
workforce can securely access legacy and modern applications without exposing
your network to attacks; and two, how you can get better protection against threats
and data loss right from within your browser; and three, how you can gain visibility
into unsafe activity even if users are on a corporate network or device. And we're
going to do all of this with BeyondCorp Enterprise.
BeyondCorp Enterprise, or BCE, as we call it, is Google Cloud's zero trust access
solution. With BCE, you can use Chrome to access apps and resources. In the
background, Google's network protects and proxies traﬃc enforcing access policies.
These policies use factors such as identity, device info, location and third-party
signals to authorize access to apps and data that you need to do your job.
That's awesome, Marco. So let's get to the good stuﬀ. Think about it. How easy is it
for your developers to work remotely and securely right now? We know it's a tough
task. We know that making life easy for developers while also protecting your code is
critical. That's why our new BeyondCorp Enterprise feature, client connector is so
important. It enables zero trust access to legacy thick client applications.
Yes. I think a lot of people run into that today. So let's take a look at how developers
would use it. We set up this laptop for the Cymbal Group.
By the way, they're a ﬁctional company. Cymbal has been around since the 1970s and
they haven't modernized all their applications. Sound familiar? One of their main
developer applications is still hosted in a private data center.
Now, I see this quite a bit. Until recently, Cymbal developers didn't have a way to
access this application remotely without a VPN. The security team had constant
concerns that remote users could expose the network or even worse, their source
code to attacks or hackers. But now, using BeyondCorp Enterprise's client connector,
they can access client-server apps without a VPN. Let me show you how CymbalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)

A - Marco Genovesedevelopers would connect via SSH to their Git repository. And before I show you, let
me just say, don't blink or you might miss it. It's that simple.
So let's go ahead and swing on over to our developer machine. From here, I can
simply open up Google Chrome. Once Google Chrome has actually loaded, you can
see I have authenticated to mykit application repository already. Up in the right-hand
corner, I simply click on my endpoint veriﬁcation extension, and from here I click on
start connection. My endpoint has been postured in the background and a secured
connection has been made to GitLab. From there, I can simply then, once it's turned
green of course, minimize my browser. And then on the left hand side, I'm going to
go ahead and open up my terminal application, this is my thick client application.
I'm going to then go ahead and run a Git clone and that's actually going to pull
down the code from Git to my local machine. And there is my application pulled
down locally onto my endpoint. I know that probably seemed pretty straightforward.
But what you might not have noticed was: ﬁrst, there were no clients, it's all in the
browser you probably already had opened; second, in the background, continuously
validating the identity and the device and a bunch of other factors is our identity
were a proxy; and third, our TCP proxy seamlessly and securely forwards all the
traﬃc. The fact that developers around the world can do this remotely, simply and
securely without all the hassle of VPN is pretty awesome.
And with BeyondCorp Enterprise, workers are only allowed access to applications
they're permitted to use. So, we prevent unwanted lateral movement across the
network. So audience, we want to know, would you use this method for remote
access in your organization?
Awesome. Now, let's see how your workforce can securely access modern web
applications, even from non-corporate devices. Let's look at how Cymbal does it for
their extended workforce, their call center contractors.
Meet Rhonda. She's one of thousands of remote contractors who help with Cymbal's
24/7 support during the holiday shopping season. So, security community, can you
share in our chat in the past year have you onboarded new temporary workers? Did
you send them a laptop or make them install software so they could be more
secure?
Looks like that would be a yes. Contractors also tend to be more vulnerable to
attacks. Last year, 44% of organizations experienced a breach and 74% of those
breaches were the result of giving too much privileged access to third parties. So for
Cymbal, keeping those users oﬀ the corporate network decreases the risk of being
exposed to attacks like Ransomware. And here's where using BeyondCorp
Enterprise comes through again for Cymbal. Contractors and other employees wereFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

A - Tanisha Raiable to BYOD, onboard quickly and use the device that they feel comfortable with,
while BCE layers of protection keep them secure.
That way, Rhonda can have secure access from her own device with clear separation
between work and personal activity. Let me show you exactly what she sees as she
begins her day. She ﬁrst navigates to her Google Chrome browser. Then she
navigates to her Cymbal call center application, will enter in our credentials. We will
then do two-factor authentication with our time security key.
Now that we passed two-factor authentication, we are in our Cymbal call center
application. You saw Rhonda log in to chrome with her Cymbal credentials. This is
what we call a BeyondCorp protected proﬁle. It extends threat and data protection
as soon as she logs in. As you can see, our agentless approach means no additional
software. She gets right to work on her own device rather than picking up a laptop
from IT and waiting hours while everything gets conﬁgured, therefore saving time
and money.
Awesome, Tanisha. And the thing about zero trust access is that we don't
automatically trust Rhonda, just because she has login credentials. Authorization is
continuous, not just when she ﬁrst logs in. BeyondCorp Enterprise enforces Cymbal's
contractor access policies, based on her identity and contextual information about
her device and location, as well as the fact that she's authenticated with her Titan key.
So, security community, we want to know, what do you all use for multi-factor
authentication, SMS code, security keys, maybe an authentication app or maybe
something else completely? Hopefully, it's not nothing.
For me, it's my security key, every day, especially since I don't always have my phone
on me.
Yes, same here. They're so easy to use and they provide the strongest protection
against phishing. Regardless of what you use, some form of multi-factor
authentication is critical for basic security hygiene and we highly recommend it,
especially for remote access. So let's take a look. I don't know if anybody has
anything. Looks like, most people use, let's say, security keys, B, awesome. That's
what we love to hear. So, let's get back to Rhonda who just authenticated to the app
and explore how we can integrate threat and data protection right from within her
browser.
Great. Let's see her get to work and show our BCE protect Cymbal, their customers
and Rhonda with ease. It's been a really busy day. She doesn't have enough time to
ﬁnish processing a batch of customer refunds before her next call. She wants to saveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 58 of 69A - Marco Genovese
A - Tanisha Rai
A - Marco Genovesethe customer credit card information to a local ﬁle and do the refunds when things
slow down. But saving the sensitive information to another location is against
Cymbal security policy. Let me show you her experience.
Let's navigate to our credit card ﬁle and let's download this where Rhonda can do
the refunds at another time. As you can see, she's blocked. You can see a message
appear at the bottom that prevents her from doing so.
Yes, exactly. You can actually see where the credit card PDF has sensitive and
dangerous content inside of it. And I'll show you a policy that's been conﬁgured for
Cymbal that will detect risky behaviors just like these. So let's go ahead and look at
our administrative console here in admin.google.com.
Over on the left hand side, you can see the security menu. And if you scroll down
underneath security, you can actually see data protection. And we're going to go
ahead and authenticate obviously as administrator securely. So let's go and type in
our password. And once I've authenticated, I'll be able to go ahead and look at my
data protection policies. You'll notice here, which says managed rules. So we're
going to go ahead and drill into managed rules and we can actually see now the
credit card detection policy that Ron is hitting right here. We've also got detectors
for things like social security or even detecting code that's being copied or pasted
or shared by the developers. So as the admin, you can decide if you want to
automatically block user actions, as Cymbal has done here or if you want to trigger
warning to the user instead.
And in addition to things like credit card numbers, you can also set speciﬁc DLP
policies to detect ﬁle type as source code. So that way you can protect sensitive
information and code by monitoring, controlling or even blocking what people
upload or download.
Exactly. We can use very granular policies for this type of information in order to
protect against exﬁltration. So, we just showed you some of the types of data
protection policies you can set up. You can also customize access policies and the
changes take eﬀect in real time. This is a really big deal because you get continuous
checking of whether a user is in or out of policy, giving you up to the second security
controls. In fact, let's make an update here in real time for Rhonda. So okay,
community, we're going to ask you which policy we should change. Is it her location,
maybe her operating system policy? Or whether or not she's on a corporate owned
device? Please chime in here, we'd really love to understand and hear what you guys
deem important.
While we wait for the results to come in, I will say that I see these kinds of things all
the time with my customers. They want to be able to dynamically change policies
depending on their circumstances. In particular, some customers are reallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 59 of 69A - Tanisha Rai
A - Marco Genoveseinterested in controlling for location, perhaps limiting access to only certain
countries. Additionally, if a company is going through an org change or maybe a
merger, being able to change access policies for select groups of users or
departments in real time is crucial. And beyond these three choices in the poll, there
are many other ways to customize your access policies based on what your
organization needs. So, let's go ahead and look back at the polls.
And it looks like corporate owned device. So awesome. I love it. And thanks to
everybody contributing. Let's go ahead and do this right now. So we're going to go
ahead and jump on over into our GCP Cloud console. And from here, we can see
our Identity-Aware Proxy. We can actually see our Cymbal GitLab for a developer
application. We can also see our call center application.
And again, these applications could be anywhere and for this demo, they're in GCP.
We're going to go ahead and select the call center application and down at the
bottom, we can see Rhonda over on the right hand side in her application access
policy. Let's go ahead and edit that, and we're going to go ahead and remove the
existing access policy that's allowing access from Europe and the U.S., and we're
going to go ahead and delete that one. And we're going to add a new rule.
We're simply going to go ahead and select Cloud IAP, IAP web app user. And then
from there, we're going to go ahead and select the access policy which everybody
chose, and that was required corporate device, right? Okay. Just want to make sure I
remember that correctly. Let's go ahead and save that in place. Click save and when
we save that policy, it's actually going to be propagated across the world within a
very short period of time. All of the proxies across Google's global network are
immediately updated. So the next time any user tries to access a protected resource,
they're evaluated against that new policy set. We mentioned continuous
authorization earlier and this is a key part of that. Authorization is not a one-time
occurrence. So even if you begin a new session, that doesn't mean you'll have
perpetual access.
Exactly. And for companies like Cymbal that employ hourly and temp workers, their
ability to dynamically update access conditions is important. For instance, they could
set these policies so workers only access applications and resources during their
shift hours or working days or only allow access from speciﬁc geographies. They also
may want to require that devices have the most up-to-date operating systems and
security patches. So this is an important condition to manage, especially for all the
contractors using their own devices.
Exactly. So because Rhonda doesn't meet that condition, which I just updated, she
will no longer be able to access the call center application. Now, I think we've all
faced this and it's one of the most frustrating things about remote access, especially
when you're using the VPN. You think you should have access to something, but for
some reason, it's just not working.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 60 of 69A - Tanisha Rai
A - Marco Genovese
A - Tanisha Rai
A - Marco GenoveseIt's so worse. So let's see if our real-time change worked. So when Rhonda tries to
open a new task in the call center application, let's take a look at what she sees. Let's
navigate back to her home. And she's denied access, as a result of the change
Marco just did. But once again, BCE has Rhonda covered. She can report this error
using our new feature the BeyondCorp Enterprise policy troubleshooter, which
informs end users that they're blocked and tells them how to get help quickly. So, as
you can see here, she would follow the prompt to email the admin to get help. Let's
go ahead and email our admin. Our admin is now notiﬁed of us being blocked. With
BeyondCorp Enterprise policy troubleshooter, admins can quickly ﬁx issues that are
blocking users keeping them productive.
Yes. You bet. Let me show you what the Cymbal admin would see on the other side
of this request and how they can unblock users like Rhonda. So we're going to go
ahead and switch gears. Let's go over to Gmail, another Google application. And it
looks like we got a notiﬁcation for credit card detection, which is good. So we know
if Ron is taking some interesting actions within her endpoint, oh, and it looks like we
just got an email from Rhonda because she's actually been blocked to an
application. There's the link that she sent over, so let's go ahead and click on that,
and we'll automatically be logged directly into the Google Cloud platform.
So from here, I can actually see the diﬀerent policies and bindings that are in place.
So let's go ahead and select the call center application. And over on the right hand
side here, we can actually see the granted conditions or the denials themselves. So
let's go ahead and look at the binding details. So interestingly here, we can see that
Rhonda failed to meet any of the listed access levels and sure enough, it's requiring
a corporate device which was not granted. So I normally go back and I block her by
updating that policy. So her access level is evaluated like any other contractor, but
we're going to keep moving just in the interest of time.
Sounds good. That was so easy by the way.
Yes, super easy. Now, let's look how BCE can give us some better visibility into
unsafe user activities, whether there are unsuccessful access attempts like we just
saw or other anomalous activities across the apps that BCE protects. Let me put the
security dashboards in Chrome and give you all a look. So, we're going to jump back
over into our Google Admin console here and in the same security menu on the left
hand side, we can actually click on dashboards. Wait for those to load out for a
second. So something to make note of here is that with Chrome data protection,
you're actually going to get a whole slew of diﬀerent information. We can see
Chrome high-risk users, we can see individuals with DLP incidents if we want to scroll
down a little bit. We could actually see how many users are forgetting their
passwords, if I can ﬁgure out how to use a track pad here. So we can see user login
attempts, we can see for example messages that are encrypted, but what we'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

let's go ahead and drill a little bit into one of these reports.
So we can see every single ﬁle uploaded, ﬁle downloaded, web content upload for
example. We can actually see every single time that this took place for our social
security detection as well as credit card detection. And if we were to actually drill in
on credit card detection here and I think it's really cool, so I'm going to show
everybody real quick here since we do have like another minute and that is all the
sensitive data transfers that are taking place, block detected or otherwise. So even if
your organization isn't using all corporate-owned devices, you can still monitor
security events and investigate those alerts.
That's awesome, Marco. Audience, so what do you think? Let us know in the chat. We
deﬁnitely know this is something of interest. In the last 15 minutes, you've seen how
an entire workforce can access modern and legacy applications securely, how you
can improve threat and data protection and how you can get better visibility into
risky activity, even on unmanaged devices.
Yes. Our call right at the end of the day with BeyondCorp Enterprise is to make your
experience more productive and more secure and our team looks forward to
supporting you on your zero trust journey.
Thanks so much for joining us today and participating. We have a live Q&A coming
up next to answer all of your Google Cloud security questions, as well as any
questions you might have had from the demo. So please stick around.
Yes, please do. And thank you all for joining. We will see you all soon.
Bye.
Awesome. Thanks so much, Tanisha and Marco. That's an incredible demo. It's always
fun to see our products in action, and I'm sure between the great spotlight earlier,
the demo, our audience has some great questions lined up. So thank you for joining
everyone today. My name is Iman.
And I am Sri. I'm so thrilled to be here, answering your questions live from our
fabulous studio here in Sunnyvale.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

just a few minutes ago. So you may see them pop up to help answer questions
throughout the show. Okay. Let's jump right in with a little poll. Tell us what got you
most excited today? Is it our trusted cloud? Is it are zero trust philosophy? Is it our
$10 billion cybersecurity investment? Or is it the Cybersecurity Action Team? And by
the way, I'm waiting for these poll results. So while we wait for these results, just a
reminder, this Q&A is live, so you can engage with us directly.
So Steve, Brian, Dinesh, I'm watching all of you right here live on the chat. So, if you
can, just go back to the Next event website and click on the blue 'Join the Interactive
Experience' button. And as we give you some time to submit your poll, I want to hear
the scoop from you, Sri. So, tell us what you're most excited about?
I am really excited about the zero trust model. I feel like, we're kind of adopting it
and we're seeing a lot of people move toward it. So -- yeah.
Yes. I mean, we've been doing this for so long, right? We're taking an approach that
we've pioneered and we're putting it out in the world and are watching a lot of
customers sort of adopting this approach now.
Yes, absolutely.
Awesome. Looks like --
Looks like, it is.
Looks like it is. Yes, that's right. That's right. Looks like a lot of people are really
excited about zero trust, that's amazing. Okay, cool. What's the next runner up?
We've got our $10 billion cybersecurity investment, but zero trust is deﬁnitely leading
by a pretty big margin. All right, so let's go ahead and get started. Let's kick oﬀ our
ﬁrst question, yes.
All right, sounds good.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

Page 63 of 69A - Sri Subramanian
A - Iman Ghanizada
A - Sri SubramanianAll right, cool. So I guess while we're waiting for questions from the audience to
populate, the question I have for you is, why security dominating the headlines?
You have to be under a rock to not like notice all the stuﬀ that's happening around
us, all the IPOs with SentinelOne and ForgeRock and Darktrace. And we're seeing
Presidents and Prime Ministers commit a large amount, a giant amount of dollars
including our New President to security. And so, I think there are two things here.
Typically, an industry will see a lot of movement because there is a technology shift
that happens and we're seeing that too with the digital transformation, the way that
we secure our environment has changed, and so there's a lot of movement that's
happening in this industry because of that.
Added to that, security has this other thing where it's also driven by the people who
are attacking the -- the attacks that are happening and we're seeing a huge amount
of attacks happening today. And as a result, like for example, we've had -- I mean,
this is really sad, we've had our ﬁrst death that happened because of a Ransomware
this year. We've had a pipeline company having to pay a ton of money for a
Ransomware. We had -- we've had manufacturing companies get disrupted in their
manufacturing at a distillery company, basically had a disruption pretty recently. And
so, we're seeing a lot of this happen all around us and that's kind of adding more
focus into this area, where people are starting to realize that this is an important area
that needs a lot of investment, because otherwise businesses are going to suﬀer
because of it and nations are going to suﬀer because of it. And that's I think part of
the reason that we're seeing this doubling of that exponential growth.
You mentioned a couple of great things. Like, I've noticed that the cloud evolution
has allowed a lot of businesses to sort of transform the way that they work, the way
that they oﬀer services and products to their consumers, and we as human beings
are now more dependent on technology now more than ever. And so, I was like to
say that like, cybersecurity is going to start to be seen as a service-oriented role, an
honorable role in society because we have customers who build healthcare systems
on our cloud, industrial systems on our cloud, oﬀer all sorts of services, right? And as
we become more and more dependent on technology, we need to ensure that we're
also advancing the state of how secure our infrastructure is, so that we can protect
our customers and protect the people at the end of the day.
So, looks like we got a question from Jeanette[ph] which is, what makes Google's
cloud more secure and trusted than its competitors?
So, Google actually started building a lot of these security products for itself, right?
So Google is known as a very secure company and so what we've done recently is
taken some of the work that we have done to secure our own corporations or our
own customers like BeyondCorp that we just saw the demo for or a reCAPTCHA and
productized it, and the vision here is that every customer can be just as secure as
Google is. Add to that this idea of innovation that's there at Google. So for example,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 64 of 69A - Iman Ghanizada
A - Sri Subramanian
A - Iman Ghanizada
A - Marco Genovesewhen we decided to go into the federal space and do a FedRAMP certiﬁcation,
instead of just standing up a couple of data centers near North Virginia and saying
like, let's do that, let's -- this is a set of customers, let's give them a cloud that is
compliant to their needs, we decided to make all of Google Cloud FedRAMP pie.
And so now, a customer in Brazil can leverage those features just as much as a
federal customer might.
So I think there is this leaning in to the forefront of security that we're now seeing
with the trusted partner cloud, for example, we had a couple of announcements last
week, we had an announcement with Thales. And we're sort of saying that you can --
a lot of nations want to be able to own their own infrastructure and their own destiny.
And so, we're taking the Google Cloud and kind of making it available to them in a
way that they own it and they operate it. And so, that's another thing that we're
doing that's kind of pushing the boundaries, and I think this is just this idea of
pushing the boundary, that is what makes Google really special.
Yes, I think you mentioned something that's really important that which is like,
because we own all of our infrastructure and we've served billions of users all
around the world through Gmail, through search and through all this, it's kind of a
no-brainer that we also allow enterprises and small businesses to also now revamp
the way that they do their operations on our cloud and on our infrastructure. And so,
we are able to do global changes like that with the FedRAMP certiﬁcation, right,
where we do manage all of our infrastructure end to end, which is a big, big element
of this. It allows us to govern our cloud more securely, more eﬃciently and also to
pioneer really signiﬁcant changes for our cloud and all of our customers worldwide.
100%.
Yes. All right. We got the next question, which is from Izumi[ph]. The question is,
which operating systems does BCE support? Does BCE support third-party clouds or
on-premise application? And I believe this question would be probably best suited
for Marco.
Yes. I can answer that question. So the beauty of BeyondCorp and I would just say
based on obviously the breadth and width of our Chrome browser is that we can
support any operating system at this point. So whether it's Chrome OS, obviously,
which we love and hold near and dear to our hearts or Windows or Mac OS or Linux
or Android or iOS, we support all of them. So your users aren't going to be limited to
a particular operating system which is great, especially when you are an organization
trying to enable, right, enable your employees and your contractors. On top of that,
we support everything from thick client applications, right, to server-based
applications, web-based applications, that could be HTP, TCP-based protocols. There
is no limit at this point in time. So the kind of imagination is the limit.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

Page 65 of 69A - Iman Ghanizada
A - Sri Subramanian
A - Iman GhanizadaYes. I mean as someone who probably doesn't get as much exposure to
BeyondCorp and getting hands on as I used to, I really loved your demo. And so,
that was super helpful and I'm -- can't wait to go back and re-watch it. We've got
another question from Tara[ph], which is in the spotlight. Sunil spoke a lot about
invisible security. So two questions, this is two-pronged. If security is invisible, does
that mean that I can't change the settings or decide what security I want? And two,
does invisible security mean that security is free?
It's a great question. I think I'd like to step back and see what the problem is, right?
So the problem we're trying to solve is that there is an alert fatigue that we're trying
to deal with, right? There is -- most corporations can't even look at, forget about
processing, about 50% of the alerts that they get. So you're starting to see all these
alerts coming in, you don't look at it. And there is a lot of work being done to bubble
up the more important alerts and put them in front of the sock and so forth. But that
still means that there're 50% of the alerts that you don't even look at, right?
So the idea is, are there things that we can do to prevent certain type of action, for
example, that might not be kosher action without creating friction in the business?
So based on the businesses-owned rules, are there org policies that you can write?
Are there deny policies that you can write? What can we build into the platform in a
way that you're bringing down the number of alerts and the number of things that
you need to watch? And how do you actually guide things to happen? And so, this
idea of moving from just always responding to things to maybe preventing things,
maybe guiding people in the right direction.
A great example is, there was a customer who once told me that just by sometimes
popping up a question like, is this something that you want to do, you'll ﬁnd that a
large number of people will just not do it, right? And so, you can -- there are a lot of
diﬀerent ways that you can prevent certain things from happening and that I think is
the core to what invisible security is about. So it is based on things that someone
might conﬁgure. And it's based on the business logic that, that company wants to
have and it's not something that's just invisible in the sense that you lose visibility
into your security, it's invisible in that. There are things that you don't need to do and
they're not coming at you all the time.
(Multiple Speakers) as much as possible, it's like no security person ever said that
their job is completely stress-free and it's usually right. And so, I was like to say like,
we as humans, we do security in our everyday lives, right, with the threat model
when we leave the house, we put our seatbelts on, we lock the doors. We've been
taught over all these years of evolution how to be secure, right? Some of us more
than others, right? And then when we get into our digital lives on the cloud, we have
to relearn all these things and some of them we have to build into our infrastructure
so that they become part of our background processes and some of it comes
through user enablement and some of it comes through the amazing products thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

doing as humans into this new world where everything is technology-driven and
whatnot.
We got a question from Noor[ph], and this one's for Tanisha probably. I would say,
Tanisha, what applications does BCE support?
Thanks, Iman. BCE supports all applications from IaaS to SaaS to thick client
applications as well. And like I mentioned, we support HTTP and HTTPS in addition
to TCP protocols, like SSH and RDP.
Awesome. And I see a lot of great chatter from the audience. Ravi, Joey, Tisha,
Tommy. Awesome. Thank you for engaging. All right, cool. So we got another
question from John Mikhail[ph], sorry if I pronounced your name wrong. It says, can
you only use the Chrome browser for BCE? And then, how do you make sure the
Chrome browser is in use is the approved one? The Chrome browser that's in use is
the approved one, not another Chrome instance that could be amend in the middle.
Yes. It all makes sense. So this is kind of the beauty of Context-Aware policies, right?
We can enforce these policies down to the browser level, versions, for example, what
kind of browsers we're able to access. If it's a corporate managed browser or device,
you can wrap policies around all of that. So you can be very, very granular.
And I would say the other side of this is we want users to be able to use what
browser they want, right, for personal access. I think that's great. We should continue
to support that if that's what they want, if that's what the corporation wants. But as far
as accessing corporate resources, it's just like anything else, right? You want to be
able to manage it and we're not going to actually just trust anything. So having a
trust in Chrome browser for accessing corporate applications works great for our
customers, and it's just the best method to kind of move forward. So hopefully that
answers your question.
Thanks, Marco. Yes. All right. We got a question from Robert. And this says, how is
Google's zero trust model diﬀerent than other competing hyperscalers?
So, I think zero trust model is like -- so Google set the zero trust model and I think
there's the world that's adopting the zero trust model. The zero trust model, there's
only one model. There isn't a Google zero trust model and someone else's zero trust
model. And the zero trust model is very similar to -- maybe I think an analogy is the
things that happen today, as we got into the studio. We've all been vaccinated and
tested multiple times in the last week and still when we came in, we got tested again.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13

A - Iman GhanizadaAnd then, we were masked and had a shield and we were doing that up until we
were in front of the camera, and as soon as this is all done, we're going to be
masked and sent out, right? So this idea that you have access to something just at
the time that you have access and there's context to whether you need access or not
and where you're coming from and what you're doing and that should all be added
into the decision-making of what you are. I think that's what is zero trust, and it's
great that it was pioneered by Google. But today that is a model that's being used
everywhere.
I think where the question may be coming from is about the BeyondCorp Enterprise
and how is that diﬀerentiated? And I think the key thing here is we've seen the track
record of Google in terms of keeping our employees and our data safe through
BeyondCorp Enterprise, and we're trying to get that out to our customers. And the
one thing that I would like to point out is the zero trust model isn't just one tool. It's a
mindset, it's a way in which we do things and I'm really excited about GCAT, the
announcement that we just made about the Cybersecurity Action Team where we're
going to be having like these security experts and CISOs, people like Phil Venables,
available to our customers to think through this model and think through end-to-
end, how they're going to actually be implementing it. And so that's the exciting
thing I think overall. We have the pioneering product. We have the knowledge of
zero trust end-to-end. We've actually implemented it and we've proven it.
I love the analogy you put together about COVID and whatnot, because it's like we
went from traditional network-centric boundaries to identity-centric boundaries and
now it's like, who are you and what's your purpose and what are all the other factors
into why you should be performing this action. And I think one of the most amazing
things about when I ﬁrst joined Google was not having to use a VPN.
Yes.
Think this worked and I thought that was really nice. So we're going to go to a
question from Amitabh[ph] from Ford. So the question is, how do we implement zero
trust in our org?
This is a great question. And I'm going to actually throw that question to you. You're
in the solutions team, so let's talk about this, right? How do we implement zero trust
in the org? And I guess it starts with BeyondCorp. But what are all the factors that
you think about?
I always like to say that a lot of big workload transformations and security are not just
a matter of buying a product and paying for a service. It takes a lot of enablementFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 68 of 69A - Sri Subramanian

A - Iman Ghanizadaand education from the top down and from the bottom up. We have to structurally
think about how we're going to transform the way that we work and what
implications those have on the way that we work today and what our pros and cons
are and where our approach is going to be, what our strategy is going to be to sort
of get there. And that strategy is going to be augmented by people, by teams, by
development teams, by tools, by partners.
So when we advise customers and we sit down with clients and we talk about
solutions, right, and helping transform elements of their business, we don't just talk
about how our product can be leveraged in your organization, because we've got
product teams that can talk about the product. We talk about how we can actually
transform the business, how we can get the whole organization to culturally
transform the way that they work, and how we can get on a tangible path to
achieving a zero trust architecture in their workforce, and that may be a multi-year
strategy, right? And so, there's many, many, many diﬀerent layers to this.
I agree. I think there's this whole thing about you can think of a question only in --
you can think of a product and a particular problem that you're trying to solve, but if
you're not thinking about it end-to-end, like security is just as strong as the weakest
link, right? And so, if you have a contractor who has direct access, then you have a
problem there. So are you thinking about the thing end-to-end?
Awesome. By the way, big shout-out to the GCAT for bringing on that security
advisory role. So we got one last question here and Sri, I'm going to give you this last
question, which is, what do you mean by shared fate? And how is that diﬀerent from
shared responsibility?
It's a great question. So shared responsibility has really unfortunately come to mean
giving up responsibilities. I am responsible for something and you're responsible for
something else. And so, that is not the partnership approach that Google wants.
What we want is to be able to say, well, we're sharing the responsibility and we're
sharing the fate from that responsibility. So we're doing two things; one is we're
making sure that we're bringing in all the data left to you in terms of conﬁguration
that you might have, in terms of like secure landing zone or secure blueprints. And
then we also have risk manager to quantify and then be able to address your risk. So
all of that is what a shared fate is where we're actually being part of the process with
the customer.
Awesome. Thank you all for joining us today and big thanks to Sri, Tanisha and
Marco for sharing their insights. That's all we have for you on the live show today. Be
sure to check out our great on-demand content. Our live programming kicks oﬀ
