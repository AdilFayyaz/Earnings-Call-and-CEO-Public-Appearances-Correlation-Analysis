Good morning. To start things oﬀ this morning, we're joined by PepsiCo.
Representing the company are Al Carey, CEO of North America, Kirk Tanner,
President of North America Beverages, Vivek Sankaran, President of Frito-Lay North
America. And Jamie Caulﬁeld, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.
Al became CEO of North America in March of 2016 after having served as the CEO
of North America Beverages and formerly Frito-Lay. Kirk and Vivek have also been
leading their respective divisions since earlier this year.
The businesses have had a strong ﬁrst half, delivering solid organic topline growth
and margin expansion. We look forward to hearing Al, Kirk and Vivek's perspective
on PepsioCo's North American operations including how they're dealing with
changing consumer preferences and implementing ongoing productivity initiatives.
To begin, Al will lead with a slide to sort of set the stage and then we'll transition into
a ﬁreside chat. Then we're going to leave 10 minutes for Q&A. So Al and team,
thanks very much.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Okay, well thank you, Lauren. Good morning, everyone. So I thought I'd start out just
to set the groundwork on -- I carry this one slide with me since entering this new job
four months ago as the head of North America. We ended up, the three of us,
collaborating on what things do we want to do as PepsiCo North America. So here's -
- that is not one of the objectives.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 2 of 16So the ﬁrst thing I think you'll hear all of us talk about in this North America
organization is that we're going to rapidly transform our portfolio. And what that
means is we're trying to double down on our innovation bet through R&D and
particularly on health and wellness brands. Taking out sugar, reducing fat and salt.
And I think this is a very small example of some of the innovation that's being
introduced right now. For example, on the beverage side, enhanced waters,
probiotic Tropicana, pressed juices under the Naked brand name, high-end
premium lo-calorie tea called TeaHouse. And of course Kickstart which is normally an
indulgent product. But with 60% less sugar in this Kickstart variety which is doing
extremely well right now and we're adding to that portfolio.
So that's a big priority on the beverage side and also on the snack side. So you can
see some of the items here. And Vivek will reference some of them later on. But
more premium and more healthy snacks and you can see examples of that with
Sabra, our new Simply line of chips that are some organic and all natural. We've got
other products that you see up there like Veggie Chips under the Sun Chips brand
name. That will be the trend that you see with PepsiCo in North America over the
next several years. In fact, across all of PepsiCo globally.
The second thing, we are going to spend a lot of time talking about is One North
America is the way we go to our customers. So one voice to the customer. And I
think we've made some progress in the last couple of years on this business about
treating the retailer as one PepsiCo. And when you meet with some of these big
customers, they want one voice. They don't want to speak to three diﬀerent
companies. And we've structured ourselves in a way that allows us to do that. Right
now we are the largest supplier to the retail trade which doesn't mean good. But it
gives you a seat at the table. And on the other hand, we're the fastest growing right
now of the top suppliers. So I think we're starting to make progress because we're
taking listening to the customer very seriously.
Also you see in the middle there, ecommerce. We're not doing ecommerce as
separate organizations. We're going to do this as a PepsiCo, One PepsiCo approach.
And I think it's already proving to be a positive and our growth continues to improve.
Then ﬁnally, we're going as One PepsiCo on food service. So in food service and
vending. And that's proving to be good as our food service business is outgrowing
retail. And you can see picture down on the bottom there of this Hello Goodness
healthy vending machine. And you'll see one in the breakout room. These products
are moving rapidly as we place these in either schools or in vending locations in
business and industry and healthcare. We'll probably place 20,000 to 24,000 of
those this year.
The third is synergies, obvious synergies. Now this initial project has kicked oﬀ four
months ago. Probably sometime next year we'll have some news to report. But the
whole idea of how could we ﬁnd synergies in North America. So we saved a
signiﬁcant amount of money as PepsiCo. But don't interfere with the execution of the
individual divisions, Frito-Lay and the Beverage side. One example is one transport
company. I mean why couldn't we have one transport company and it's quite a bit ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 16savings if we can ﬁgure out how to do that? The middle is a truck that's called the
sprinter vehicle.
The sprinter truck gets 21 miles per gallon and it's used by Frito-Lay, probably has
3,000 or 4,000 of those trucks right now. And on the beverage side, initially our
team said, well that truck is not going to work for beverages because the weight of
the beverages. Well it turns out we have many places, like full service vending and
other places that we could use that truck. And the trucks we have today might be
getting 8 miles per gallon. So there's an obvious opportunity.
And the ﬁnal one I listed on the chart at the bottom is we have collapsed our
customer marketing and customer insights group into one. Each of the divisions had
their own separate insights team for the customer and now we are standing up this
one group called the Demand Accelerator. And I can tell you right now that's having
a signiﬁcant impact with our customers and we're only having it in one spot. So
we've saved some money doing that and we've increased the caliber of the
individuals on that team.
The last thing I'd say before we turn it over. And this is one that I'm very passionate
about, it's dear to my heart. And after a 35-year career at PepsiCo, I can tell you that
one of our greatest strengths is our frontline organization. Particularly in sales and
customer service. And where we've spent time in North America beverages in the
last 12 months, we've spent time going out to talk to thousands of frontline
employees and ask them, what is it that we could do to remove obstacles so that you
can improve your business?
And you can't believe the amount of positive feedback we get from this process.
And it really boils down almost, no matter what part of the country you're in, there's
probably three or four things that our frontline people need to be better. So we've
gone out and aggressively addressed those issues. We've spent the money against
the things that they need help on. And we can see an immediate improvement in our
business when we do that.
So this is something we're going to do across PepsiCo. And I think when you have
your frontline motivated and inspired, you can add points to the board. And one of
the things that's going to be part of this is developing more of a recognition culture.
I ﬁrmly believe that the people most important in our company are the ones that are
closest to the customer, that are on the frontline. These are the folks that get up at
3.30 in the morning every day and they are really getting the job done. If those
people are motivated, it is an absolute advantage, particularly in an environment
where the retail trade is looking at these minimum wages going up to a signiﬁcant
level.
And that will have an impact on labor at the store level. So I think this is a real
positive and I think it's one of those reasons why you'll probably ask later about the
refranchising. We don't want to refranchise. I'd love to have a frontline organizationFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07

on the advantage survey in terms of the way we serve our customers.
So that's kind of the one-pager I've been carrying around with me. But there's lots of
details inside of this and in the individual divisions as we're going after the business.
I just thought I'd start out with that.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 4832525 <GO>}
That's great. I was going to ask you how it is that the business is performing so well
in such a sluggish environment. But I feel like you just maybe gave us the answer key
to that. Unless there's anything you want to add that you think in terms of the ﬁrst
kind of six months of this year, there's something that you've hit an inﬂection point
on some of these initiatives that has really driven the performance this year.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
I'd just add one thing and then turn it to the team of Kirk and also Vivek. But I'd just
say that innovation has a big part of it. It's now about 9.5% of our gross sales. And
the other thing I'd say is our single serve business on both sides is doing very well,
that's where the consumer is going. And those are two highlights from the ﬁrst part
of the year.
{BIO 4832525 <GO>}
Great. Vivek. So Frito-Lay has been a very steady and consistent performer for many
years. What is it that you've done to kind of create this momentum? Why do you
believe it can continue and the conﬁdence and sustainability of the growth?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
Let me start with the categories. I think we are in a very vibrant category. And I think
about, when I think about our category I think of macro snacks. It's over $100 billion
in the US. And we play in -- we have about a 15 share of that very large category. And
people are just snacking more, that's the reality. Lifestyles are changing, people are
snacking more. We're going to get more of our calories through snacks as we go
forward here. So we are in a good category. And the way we think about it, if we can
maintain category growth and just gain a little bit of share, we've got plenty of
upside and momentum.
The things we have done to take advantage of this nice category that we are playing
in is over many years now we've worked on separating our brands. Doritos really has,
stands for being bold and has a clear message and a set of innovation that comes
with it. Lay's now stands for ﬂavor and we just keep celebrating ﬂavor. It's a
drumbeat of ﬂavor every year. Tostitos is all about the party and we keep coming
back with innovation and messaging that celebrates that occasion.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 5 of 16A - Lauren Lieberman
A - Kirk TannerAnd so we have separated these brands and we're driving the innovation and the
brand messaging very, very sharply against what we think are very diﬀerent demand
occasions for our products. And that has helped. And what we are ﬁnding is that we
have just scratched the surface on that. We continue to develop that.
The second thing, what Al said, there is nobody who drives more traﬃc, more dollar
growth and more proﬁt growth for our retailers than us in our portfolio. I mean we
are a critical part of holidays and any retailer and that virtual cycle helps. So we've
got very good channel development. And it's not just the depths of the relationships.
But also the breadth of relationships. And that is not just a Frito, it's a PepsiCo
strength I would say. And what that does is it allows us to -- we are not dependent on
any one particular channel. We can play that portfolio very well.
And the third one is, we are getting better and better and better at execution. We
continue to drive -- we ﬁnd -- so the DSD system that we have, as we put more
money into technology in the DSD system, we're able to do things with more
precision than we ever did before. So the assortment becomes more speciﬁc to a
store. Frankly a store across the street will have a diﬀerent assortment because the
traﬃc patterns are diﬀerent. And so that, every time we do that, we ﬁnd additional
growth.
So if I just step back from that, it's a matter of getting all the fundamentals right.
There's no magic to this. But getting the fundamentals right and getting better at
each one of those three things that I talked about.
{BIO 4832525 <GO>}
Great. Kirk, I know it's relatively recent that you assumed leadership of the North
America Beverage business. But I think it would be great to get some perspective on
what's changed the last few years, bought the bottlers in 2010. What was the state of
the business back then and then how would you contrast that with today?
{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
I think if you think about our business before the acquisition, we were very focused
on selling carbonated soft drinks and large take-home packs, driving volume. I think
that has shifted towards selling the total portfolio and being focused on revenue
management. That's kind of the big, overarching things. But I think if you look at the
slide that Al showed, our focus on innovation has really doubled. Doubled in that
time. Which is a tremendous progress on how we have tried to reach consumers with
our innovation.
The other area is food service And food service, again, on Al's slide, it talked about
that's where we sell the total PepsiCo portfolio. And it allows us to focus on growing
our customer with all the tools that we have, giving our customers kind of a full
access pass to PepsiCo. I think Vivek talked a little bit about kind of the last 4 or ﬁve
years around execution and speed in our market. Our speed in our system to get
alignment and to grow our customers' business. And that's I think a really big
change over the last ﬁve years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07

A - Vivek SankaranBut if you sum it up, a strong focus on revenue management, innovation, food
service. And growing our customers' business I guess would summarize what's
changed over the last 4 or ﬁve years.
{BIO 4832525 <GO>}
If I can follow up on revenue management and innovation, a component of that is
going to be package mix. So how do you feel about package variety today? Are you
where you need to be and want to be competitively?
{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
We're very -- we've made a lot of progress around package size. Our price-sized
architecture, all of us call it that, that's a big priority for us. But our strategy is really
grounded in consumer insights, on meeting consumers where they're at. And Al
talked a little bit about single serve. But our development of our single serve packs
across the diﬀerent channels has allowed us to grow the single serve business.
In addition we've launched, you've seen them in the marketplace, mini cans, smaller
packages. It's all about capturing consumers where they're buying our products and
delivering and exceeding their expectation with the pack size. So it's not just pack
size to drive revenue, it's pack size to drive revenue and to reach consumers in what
they're looking for. We've made a lot of progress. Still a lot of work to do in this
space. But it's a big focus of ours.
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
We've seen the same thing, Lauren. The consumers just seem to be willing to pay
more for convenience, some form of portion control. So the multipack business is
growing for us, the single serve business is growing for us. And that I think clearly
serves a consumer need but also is a better ﬁnancial outcome for us.
{BIO 4832525 <GO>}
And also, health and wellness trends, Vivek. And how that is impacting your side of
the house and also dealing with the premium end of the category and what you're
doing to respond.
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
I'll address both. Let me talk about the premium end ﬁrst. The premium end is about
10% of the marketplace. And we are I'd say about a 39%, 40% share of that premium
marketplace. We have gained share year to date. I think it's about 60 basis points of
share gain. The way we play that, we've done two things. One is, we've got brands,
we've had brands in the premium Better For You space for a while, like Smartfood
and Simply and such.
We have doubled down on those. We have increased our investment there. And
those, that portfolio of brands for us is growing 4 times faster than the core. So
there's a lot of momentum on that front. And we are ﬁnding that there is a segment,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 7 of 16A - Lauren Lieberman
A - Vivek Sankaran
A - Lauren Lieberman
A - Kirk Tannera large segment of consumers who want Better For You and premium but also want
a brand they can recognize. And that's playing to our strength.
The other thing we are doing is we're also incubating. We are incubating brands you
won't recognize it as a Frito-Lay product in the marketplace. And as we see
something sticking, we'll amplify it. So we're starting to play that.
Now the health and wellness, now much like Al said, we reconsider it's a reality,
consumers want healthier products in the mix. And so we are doing a couple of
things. First is you will see choice. You will see Doritos. But you'll also see in a school
reduced fat Doritos. You'll see Smartfood, you'll see Smartfood Delight. Smart Food
Delight is 35 calories a cup. So ﬁrst of all, we are giving choice to consumers on
pretty much all our portfolio. Lay's, reduced salt Lay's, which does very well by the
way.
And the second thing we are doing is we don't talk about it too much to the
consumer. But we consistently take out salt, we've taken out all trans-fat, we keep
reducing trans-fat from our portfolio. So we keep taking out what consumers might
perceive as negatives in the portfolio. So in essence we are making sure we have a
wide enough portfolio to play the game as it evolves.
{BIO 4832525 <GO>}
Do you advertise those changes or do you choose to kind of keep them on the down
low?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
When we make changes to the core portfolio, we keep it -- we make -- if the changes
are small, we don't want to make that a big deal to give any perception of taste
changes or anything. But there are places where we would call it out. So we actually
called out a reduced salt Lay's, reduced salt Ruﬄes. We called that out because
there's a segment of consumers who really wants that. It's a great tasting product.
But they just feel better with that product.
{BIO 4832525 <GO>}
Kirk, I think also, everyone is talking about portfolio transformation. So just some
examples there. And I think also earlier we were talking about some of the due
diligence that you all do on what millennials are eating and drinking and I thought
that was really interesting how you're kind of trying to get a step ahead of where the
market is going.
{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely. We see it across. When you play a portfolio strategy, you can see
across your portfolio where you have growth, explosive growth. And no growth. And
we talked about carbonated soft drinks, that's in the low to no growth area. But
we've seen explosive growth around teas, coﬀees, our sports portfolio withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 8 of 16A - Al Carey

A - Lauren LiebermanGatorade, the water portfolio across enhanced waters and premium waters to
everyday water.
There's a lot of growth in the category out there and we're watching where
consumers are going. And you can really -- if you pay attention to what consumers
are buying on college campuses, what Generation Z is buying. And you're trying to
meet those consumers' needs with the innovation platforms, I think that's where
we're aligned. We're aligned with having a broad portfolio strategy and then we're
innovating against that.
Some innovations that are pretty interesting that Al talked a little bit about, products
like Kickstart. Kickstart is a product that you build from scratch and you go, what
would a modern day product like this, it is carbonated soft drink. But it delivers on
60 calories per 12 ounce, it's sweetened a little bit with juice, 5% juice. Some of the
formulations have coconut water. And it just hits the mark on what consumers are
looking for. And that's been an example of a product that's been a real hit from an
innovation standpoint.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
To answer your question earlier, we don't talk about the lower sugar. It's 60% less.
But we just don't talk about it.
{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
Yes. We don't shout it. It tastes great. I mean it's a great tasting product. But there's a
lot of innovation that we focus on in this space around our tea business. This is an
example of PureLeaf, it's our Tea House from our PureLeaf brand, premium product.
Our coﬀee portfolio partnership with Starbucks is also a great place for innovation.
We're also innovating against a platform across our sports nutrition platform that
really meets consumers and athletes where they're going . And that's the focus.
Again, it's just a portfolio approach, watching where there's explosive growth, high
growth and no growth and innovating towards that space.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
We have a great deal of consumer research that tells us where the GenZ consumer is
going and the millennial moms. Those are two we watch real carefully. But at the end
of the day, it's simpler than that. Just go on a college campus and see what are the
highest selling products on campus. Water, Gatorade. Third, which is a surprise,
Lipton PureLeaf tea. Then we've got Starbucks and we've got Mountain Dew. Those
are the ﬁve selling. So if we're not hitting where that consumer is going in the next
ﬁve years, we would have a tough time. But I think we are making some progress in
that area.
{BIO 4832525 <GO>}
Let's switch gears a little bit to proﬁtability. So Al, if you take a look at PepsiCo North
America in the top, what are -- you mentioned a little bit. But some of the examples
of synergies and speciﬁc examples between the two. And also, where does kind of
Quaker ﬁt into that mix?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 9 of 16A - Al Carey

A - Vivek Sankaran{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Yes. So Quaker has been a brand that hasn't grown very much over the last several
years and I think it has great potential. Because if you think of grains and you think of
oats, it's almost -- it's a super grain. And what I found really interesting, I've only been
involved with Quaker now for about four months. But Google Overnight Oats and
see what comes up. And it's this absolutely beautiful array of diﬀerent overnight oats
that millennial moms have invented. I mean the idea if you put oats in a jar overnight,
pour in milk or yogurt, put in fruit, some people put in chocolate, some people put in
peanut butter.
And what you get at 6 hours later in the morning when your kids wake up for
breakfast, is this wonderful, healthy product. And when I heard about it, I said I'm not
interested in eating that Then I tasted it and it's amazing. And I thought, I've showed
it to some of the top retailers and they start out negative and they taste it and they
say, how can we get this? I think there's a great opportunity for Quaker to brand
overnight oats. We have the dominant share and I think this is an example of how
you can take oats and turn it into something really healthy and on trend. And there
are several ideas like that. And it's a very proﬁtable product for us. Very proﬁtable
overall margin as well as cash ﬂow and return on invested capital.
{BIO 4832525 <GO>}
And how about just some synergies across the broader portfolio?
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Well the biggest one is to make sure that Quaker is represented on our customer
visits. So we have one PepsiCo team going in to see one of our big customers.
Getting them on the agenda is really good because the smaller Quaker Oats
company isn't going to command a seat at the table with the biggest customers. But
that -- we can make that happen. That's the thing that could use a little work.
The second thing is, on the food service side, as Kirk was mentioning Quaker,
breakfast is increasing in overall importance in the food industry today and Quaker
should be a much bigger part of that.
{BIO 4832525 <GO>}
Vivek, talk about margins. Extremely high margins at Frito-Lay, among the highest in
the food industry. Are you concerned that margins might be a little too high,
particularly given what some of your larger customers are up to these days? Or to
the contrary, is there further runway for margin expansion from here?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
There's only one answer to that which is it's not too high. So the way I think about it
is, we think about two -- we think about it as price realization and cost. We continue
to do things on both and I'll give you examples. So price realization, ﬁrst of all, ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 10 of 16A - Al Careyinnovation. Every time we bring out innovation, we get a better price realization. So
out there you've got Indian Tika Masala chips, right?
And those -- so we bring out these new things that people want to try and are willing
to pay just a little more for it. The price point may be the same. But there's less
ounces in the bag. And we have this constant drumbeat of innovation coming in all
the time to give us that little extra pricing.
Second, we are very good, we continue to improve. But very good at managing
revenue on a week to week basis. So by retailer, by customer, we are always trying to
think about how to manage the revenue. Then the third piece there is mix and I
mentioned the mix working from a consumer demand standpoint to our advantage.
The single serve and the multipacks. And recognize that in both single serve and
multipacks, we've got two advantages that many others don't.
In the multipack we've got a variety in the portfolio. So when you buy that multipack,
you buy something for everybody in the family. In single serve, it's hard to beat a
DSD system when you want to win with single serve. So we've got those price
realization mechanisms going well for us.
Then if I switch to the cost side, we -- it's initiatives that you are familiar with, like GES.
We continue to roll it out, we continue to ﬁnd more than we imagined as we roll that
out. Second. And the nice thing about GES is a lot of these productivity initiatives are
also helping us be more eﬀective. So we carry more SKUs now in a GES location than
we did in a typical distribution center.
Get the assortment right for the store, like I mentioned earlier, gives you more
growth. So then we continue to drive automation in all our factories and DCs, the
DCs that remain. Now it used to be that we couldn't automate the multipack. If you
think about the multipack in a sack, it's more diﬃcult. And we couldn't ﬁnd it
anywhere so our engineering team invented it. So we now have automatic packing
for our multipack.
We continue to drive -- we call it a smart spend initiative. We continue to drive
productivity through that. Then we expect more productivity, like Al mentioned,
working together. So we have a lot of conﬁdence both in the topline and on the cost
line which if we continue to do, we'll continue to expand margins. And the measure
we use to gauge whether it's too high is, at the end of the day, are we gaining share
or not? And we are. So we feel comfortable in the position we are in.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Share is a good governor. But I left Frito-Lay probably 5 or six years ago and it had
just started GES. It's remarkable how well they've done. And in addition to the
margin and the eﬀectiveness, the inventory levels have come down dramatically. And
that's made a real diﬀerence. And now Kirk is taking a play out of their book and
doing GES equivalent for the beverage business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07

I was actually going to ask because I know on a recent call you had mentioned just
this. So if you could give us kind of a one-minute recap of sort of what GES is and
just how that model can be leveraged and mimicked in the beverage business, it
would be great.
{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
I'll take it from the beverage side. I also spent -- I've been with PepsiCo for 24 years
and 18 of those I spent on the Frito-Lay side. So I saw GES really come to life and get
results as I was part of many rollouts in GES. On the beverage side, think about the
eﬃciencies and the complexity managed upstream. So what we're trying to do with
GES is drive simplicity at the store level, manage all the complexity up at kind of the
distribution warehouse level. So that at the frontline, the simplicity is, I just have to
order, I have the technology in my hand, I get the products that I want. I don't have
to manage this massive assortment. And all that complexity is managed upstream.
There's no touches. We're reducing the amount of touches our frontline have to have
in the packages.
Now in beverages, the same thing. So it's really easy to think about a Pepsi truck
pulling up to a convenience store and having to open up all the diﬀerent doors and
then build the order from that. Have to go around and build the order for what that
customer wants. In GES, all that's done at the warehouse level. The salesperson pulls
up to the store and that order is already pre-picked, sequentially in order so that the
salesperson walks it into the store and merely puts it in the store.
It completely changes the dynamic of and just modernizes the entire go to market. It
drives simplicity at the store level. It drives our safety agenda because the fewer
times you touch the products, the better. It's just an overall better job for our
employees. It's a real give back in driving the performance of our business and it's
an eﬃcient way for us to manage complexity. Again, as consumers want more
choice, you have to have a system that manages that complexity and that variety
upstream so that you don't manage it at the store level.
But I think that's it from a GES standpoint. We're really excited about. We work, our
two teams work aggressively together to learn from each other on this and we've
learned a great deal from Frito-Lay over the last couple of years in rolling this in the
beverage business. We're real excited about it.

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantYes, either Al or Kirk, on the portfolio transformation process, could you talk about
the revenue growth outlook and how -- or maybe provide a roadmap of how the
portfolio transforms and delivers a certain sort of low to mid-single digit revenue
growth? And what I'm talking about is maybe half the portfolio is carbonated soft
drinks. What's the trajectory for that in your transformation process? Then the non-
carb side. Maybe just break it down a little bit how each piece is moving and where
you expect it to be over time to get to your revenue growth outlook.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
So we want to stay away from forecasting. But let's just -- I think you'd be safe to say
if you just look at the syndicated data, it would say that the carbonated soft drink
business is ﬂat to slightly growing. Then you've got double digit growth on the non-
carb and the teas, coﬀee, sports drinks and all that kind of stuﬀ. And that mix works.
When I got into the beverage business about 5 or six years ago, I didn't know if you
could sell enough tea and sports drinks and coﬀee to make up for the depressed
business on CSDs.
And the answer is now, yes you can. And I think the consumer is sending it in that
direction. So we're optimistic about the portfolio transformation and these healthier
products that we're introducing are deﬁnitely hitting the mark. Most of them, as Kirk
said, are single serve products, more than these multipacks. And it commands a
better margin for us and the retailer gets a better margin for us. So there's some pull
from the retailer side. Anything else to add?
{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
Yes, I'd just say yes, we look at the business as less than half of our business is in
carbonated soft drink, the other half is in NCBs. And we manage the growth in that
regard. And I'd say, again, similar to the snack category, the category is in good
health when you look at the total category. And that's how we look at it. We don't
look at just carbonated soft drinks. We look at the total liquid refreshment beverage
category. And we're very, I'd say that's in good shape.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Beverages right now are growing the fastest of any category. We call it new Lo-C,
which is the retail component of IRI. And it's signiﬁcant growth compared to the rest
of the sub cats that are in the retail stores.
Hi. I had a question about sports drinks and the innovations in that category.
Obviously it's a great category for you. Over the years you've had various
innovations. Where do you think the consumer will evolve, how will the consumer
evolve in that category? Does the category need to evolve to lower calorie, more
focus on sugar, etc.? Or is it thriving so much now that you don't see the need for
that?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
We treat this category like the sports fuel category. So it's to fuel athletes, to
complement their activities and enhance their performance and support their
performance. So that's how we look at the total business. And across that portfolio,
we have a set of products that meet the diﬀerent needs of that athlete, all the way
from Propel which has the electrolytes of Gatorade but doesn't have any calories. It's
zero calories.
All the way to out G2 performance, a lighter oﬀering for Gatorade, all the way to the
platforms that are intended for athletes, the Gatorade platform around our Fierce
stuﬀ for us in our core line. All really intended, backed by science, to work with
athletes to enhance their performance. And that's how we think about the business.
We have oﬀerings across the range to meet the diﬀerent consumer needs. But really
the primary focus is to enhance an athlete's performance. And that's the focus of the
sports nutrition platform.
I'd say there's really interesting innovation oﬀ of that. There's a lot of growth in
shakes, protein, bars, shoes, all the areas that enhance an athlete's performance is a
great space and we're working on that. We're also launching a product called G-
Organics and that's going to be in the market -- it's in the market now, just starting to
roll out. It's another oﬀering to give consumers that are looking for that oﬀering and
that's three great tasting G-Organic products. I think there are some outside in the
breakroom or out in the break area as well. So if you want to try that.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
It's all about athletes and their performance. But we also include in there people
doing a lot of labor, manual work. So labor workers in construction and lawn care, I
mean those people burn up a lot of calories and they need to be rehydrated. The
one I'm most excited about that we'll get started in next year, start to roll it out
slowly. But it's the idea of a diﬀerent customized Gatorade pod.
So you get a Gatorade container that we'll sell at retail, you ﬁll it with water and you
put this little pod in the top and shake it. And you have a customized Gatorade. And
the way you ﬁnd out what kind of Gatorade you want is you're wearing a patch and
you take it oﬀ and it will measure the kind of sweat you have and it will guide you
towards a certain formula of Gatorade. And we think that -- we've worked with some
NFL teams and some college teams and it seems to be -- and the Brazil soccer team.
And this seems to be a great idea for the future. But we've got to roll it out slowly
and make sure we do it in a good way.
I just wanted to follow up on the question about the retailer and their sort of their
competitive landscape and how you guys ﬁt in that. I mean we have seen what
seems to be a bit of a deceleration in the in the pricing, especially on the beverage
side. Could you speak to how much maybe that's a retail phenomenon versus you
guys just passing out lower cost of goods and whatnot? Just trying to get a sense for
your pricing ﬂexibility which has been a hallmark over the past year or so.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07

Alec, I think if you look through our ﬁrst half, we had pretty good and consistent
price realization trends. Our quarter just ended this past weekend so we really can't
comment on the Third Quarter. We'll report on September 29th and you'll see what
the pricing trends are when we report the Third Quarter.
Indicated data?
{BIO 17051951 <GO>}
Yes, I can't comment on anything in Third Quarter, Alec.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
One thing I can tell you though is, over the last three years, we've worked -- you may
have, last time I was here I think I mentioned this on the whole idea of hybrid EDV,
the idea of -- I'm okay on that, right? I just wanted to make sure. So hybrid EDV was
this idea we started rolling out about three years ago. And the idea was, we were
selling so much product in 10 weeks of the year, during the summer holidays and
Christmas and Thanksgiving. We'd sell so much volume, as much as 50% of our
year's business on CSDs were coming in a 10-week period, maybe 12 weeks. It
wreaks havoc on the whole system.
The consumer is stocking up and loading their garages up and waiting for the next
deal and then the supply chain is in trouble. So we've started moving to something
that spreads out the bandwidth so you'll have more of an average price out there
instead of these very highs and very lows. And that's made, I think the customer is
starting to believe in that. So I would call it rational pricing in the last year or so and
don't expect that to change, hopefully not.
Hi good morning. You made a comment early on about consumers electing to take
more of their calories in diﬀerent ways, especially snacking. We've had dual income
households for a long time, people have worked long work weeks for a long time. I
can't believe it's just time compression. Is there some other secular change going on
in consumption?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
What we see is we think that the family structure has changed, like you said. There
are smaller families, younger people getting married later. We have, we see lifestyles
changing, a lot more commuting, a lot of people on the go. If I pick one category of
snacks that I think are growing the fastest is we characterize it as on the go snacks.
Things that people can just take with them.
And these multipacks I mentioned, too, it's the same phenomenon. We think it ends
up in lunch bags, we think it ends up in a car. And so it's that trend that we seeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07

coming in through snacks. So you end up seeing. And it shouldn't be a surprise then,
that you're starting to see protein based things that are working well, too, as snacks
and drinks today.
I know we're in a deﬂationary environment and maybe the need for cost saves is not
critical at this juncture. But companies throughout the industry are kind of
accelerating cost saves. What are you doing?
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Well I'll start out with we have signiﬁcant productivity initiatives on both sides of this
business and the idea that we keep the pressure on no matter what the deﬂationary
environment is, because we need the money to put back against the business. We
have a very disciplined approach about taking those dollars and reinvesting them
back in the brands, in marketing, or in R&D. In fact, we -- it's a very rigorous process
that Indra has us on, make sure you save the money and reinvest it back in the
business. Any other comments on that?
{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
I think from the beverage standpoint. And Vivek talked a little bit about it, we are
very dedicated to the things that are guaranteed on productivity, like automation.
This route system that we're working on. Smart spending which we have got rolled
across the entire organization just creates this mindset of total company productivity.
All of these are critical components of our culture and our drive. We have long term
productivity targets that we're all held accountable for and that resonates through
our culture.
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
We have never, I can't recall any time where we tie our productivity aspirations to an
inﬂationary or deﬂationary environment. Productivity is a must get under any
scenario. I attended our summer intern presentations this summer and every one of
them stands up and they've all found $20,000 or $15,000 of -- that's the
conversation that's always, always the case in PepsiCo. Never tied to together.
{BIO 17051951 <GO>}
John, the only thing I'd add is that the productivity program we're on is really trying
to carefully balance what I'd call appropriately aggressive productivity with not
doing anything that interferes with our growth. I think if we were a company that was
in categories that were in decline or not growing or had brands that were in decline
or not growing, we'd probably have to adopt a much more aggressive productivity
program. But the productivity we're delivering now, we're doing it in a way that it's
not interfering with the growth.
