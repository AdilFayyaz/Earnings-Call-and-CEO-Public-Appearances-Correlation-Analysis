Great to be here. Thank you.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 21368897 <GO>}
Awesome. I think it would be helpful for a bit of an introduction, if you could provide
us with a little bit of an overview on your role and your responsibilities at Microsoft?
{BIO 19359533 <GO>}
You bet. So as you mentioned, I'm Corporate Vice President of Total Rewards
Performance and HR business insights, and so that's basically compensation
beneﬁts, performance and development and then HR business insights. And I think
of my role as an important part of the HR function, that's really thinking about the
overall employee experience, and trying to ensure that Microsoft is an exceptional
place to work. So I work with my colleagues across HR to think about how we bring
our programs and services together, to make sure that they really support ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09

A - Kristen Roby Dimlowemployees, so that we -- our goal is that we empower our employees so they can
empower the planet.
{BIO 21368897 <GO>}
Awesome. That's a great, a great overview. So wanted to start and just think about --
thinking about Microsoft and its scale, 175 employees, I think. And obviously
customers around the globe. Can you provide some context or a bit of an overview
of how Microsoft navigated COVID just from a remote work perspective over the last
I guess it's going to be almost a year-and-a-half?
{BIO 19359533 <GO>}
Yeah. It's amazing. So I think, when I think back to the last year, it really started in sort
of the December our Chine oﬃces. And they, we learned a lot from them. We -- they
did shut down oﬃces. They were working remotely. And so when things started to
happen in the United States around the March timeframe, we very quickly took
action, and Satya, CEO and the senior leadership team who are his direct reports got
together very quickly and thought about what are our principles here. And their
number one goal was sort of help customers stay up and let's make sure our
employees are safe and healthy. And so, they also paid a lot of attention to guidance
from the WHO and various health organizations, public health organizations,
governments and very quickly decided that most of us would work remotely. And it
was wild. I think many of us probably thought, I know I thought when this happens
that all right in the United States will be home for a couple of months probably by
Memorial Day will be back. And here we are a year and a half later still working
remotely.
And it was pretty neat. I think that we shifted everybody on to Teams and to 365, we
were lucky that we were able to have the tools. Sometimes I think to myself, what if
this has happened 20 years ago. I'm not sure that the world could have stayed up
and that has productive for as long. And so, we very quickly had people work from
home. We tried to ensure that they would have resources a little bit of extra resource
for some of their productivity at home. So, getting them extra monitors and
keyboards.
We even had, hey, if you want to go and get your oﬃce chair, feel free to do it just
like your group admin know, you're doing it. And so very quickly people adapted to
working from home. But as things were on, we realized that we needed to do more.
And so within my own group, I have the HR business insights team and we have all
the employees listening systems, and so we very quickly pivoted our daily pulse, as
well as we have a lot of data coming into our Ask HR site to start to mine insights on
what employees needed. And we were able to start to respond that way. Some of
the things we did, where we put in leave policies. So we gave everyone sort of two
weeks grace period. Many of our parents with younger age, school age children
were really struck by surprise that the kids were also at home. So they were trying to
work from home, teach from home.
And so, we very quickly put together pandemic support globally, a pandemic leave.
Also as things were on into the summer time, we and realize that schools were goingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 12Q - Josh Baer
A - Kristen Roby Dimlow
Q - Josh Baer
A - Kristen Roby Dimlowto come back necessarily, particularly in the United States, we put together resources
for parents to support schooling from home, things like Sittercity for backup care. We
gave our datacenter employees backup care.
We also tried to really think about how do we support our customers. And so we put
a lot of resources up for customers to use in terms of how we were supporting the
pandemic, and also advice for them, Satya really had a mandate that in the very
beginning, especially that he wanted us to be the ﬁrst responders to -- he wanted us
to be the digital-ﬁrst responders to the ﬁrst responders. And so sometimes when we
were looking at overloads and customer support, we were trying to triage that
supports that we were giving it to people who are providing healthcare and sort of
frontline essential work.
And so I would just say it's been really an exercise in ﬂexibility and learning and
trying to understand what was important. We also partnered really closely, what we
call Viva insights now formerly workplace analytics, and sort of marry with data that
was coming out of our systems and how people were using tools and when they
were using them with our employee listening system, which is based more on
employee sentiment to really mine their critical insights on what was going on.
So I could probably talk for about three hours on all the things we did, but maybe
that's a little bit of a entry point and if there's anything you really want me to focus
on, let me know.
{BIO 21368897 <GO>}
Yes. That's excellent. And to dig in maybe on one piece around the key technologies
that you use. You certainly mentioned Microsoft Teams and we know very well about
the rapid adoption of Teams across the world. You mentioned monitors and stuﬀ like
that, but are there any other technologies that really help to enable remote work?
{BIO 19359533 <GO>}
I think we were -- Teams was enormous for us. And Teams has just grown
exponentially during the pandemic. So that has been really big. I think also the -- our
in-house IT department has done just a great job of trying to help people keep all
their devices, sort of online. They've been moving more and more of our internal
systems on to phones. So that for some of the basic stuﬀ that we would do, some of
the information that's available to employees that they could have it on their phones.
And then obviously, Microsoft 365 has been phenomenal and enable the ability to
collaborate on work in those sorts of things.
{BIO 21368897 <GO>}
Great. And you also mentioned about your ability to get some of the data and
insights. So like what was the feedback from customers on that experience. Like,
what was the good, what was the bad.
{BIO 19359533 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 12Q - Josh BaerYeah, I think, so the customers I think, I'm not for external customers, I'm probably
not the expert on this. But my sense is that we were very engaged with what was
going on. I heard amazing stories about people actually sleeping in datacenters in
certain countries. There was huge lockdown, and so we would have our own
employees to sleep in the datacenter, because they were worried they get stuck at a
roadblock trying to go home.
So I think, I think that in terms, I think generally customers felt supported. I think in
some cases, we were giving free Teams, six months of Teams to certain customers
especially ﬁrst responders who needed help.
The other thing I would say, and I'm sure many of us has felt this. I really felt like
companies came together in a great way. So I feel like there wasn't a monopoly on
sort of one company sort of leading the response, but there was really an eﬀort to
lean in together with partners and customers to come up with solutions. I know in my
own line of work, I was working with other people in other companies and roles like
mine to share.
Hey. What are you doing for your employees, what do they need. What are you
hearing about this part of the world, that part of the world. And that spirit of
cooperation has continued even recently with the India spike. There is a group of
about 200 CHROs, who are working together to support their teams in India, and
share best practices.
So in terms of employees, what we heard was needed support that one of the things
they said is we see that you're giving us leave, but we're not really sure, we're
allowed to take it. I'm not really sure that my managers going to be supportive of my
doing this. So we were able to feed that back to managers and say, hey managers
really try to be supportive here.
And the other thing we saw is that managers were the ones were really taking the
brunt of sort of the challenge. They were supporting their employees, trying to help
their employees get productive. They were also occasionally ﬁlling in for employees,
where employees needed to take these leaves. They were trying to help people in
terms of mental wellness, trying to think about how to hire people remotely, trying to
think about how do you on board. We've always had huge interim classes and we
shifted to virtual overnight.
So that was one of the things we learned from our data is the managers were
particularly stretched. And so we were able to give them advice and also air cover, if
you will, in terms of prioritization.
{BIO 21368897 <GO>}
Great. Wanted to just take a moment for any investors listening in. There is the ability
to ask questions on the quarter. We'll also try to get to those. So now, Kristen, I
wanted to shift a little bit into ask a few on culture. From my seeing on the software
team, we've been really watching the culture changed under Satya for years. And it's
been a shift more to innovation and openness both with technology and partnership.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 12A - Kristen Roby DimlowAnd so I'm wondering from your perspective, how has culture evolved over your
career at Microsoft and how are you able to maintain that culture through the
pandemic?
{BIO 19359533 <GO>}
I have seen a massive shift in culture, since I've been here. I'm a 22 year Microsoft
veteran. And I left about 6 years ago to run HR for another tech company. And
ended up boomeranging back to Microsoft. So I'm -- I sort of left at the time Steve
Ballmer was leading, and then came back, probably two years into Satya's CEO
leadership. And I'll tell you, I felt it on the ﬁrst day who is back. So one of the things
that Satya talks about is this idea of growth mindset. And I want to tell you that that
has been such a powerful concept, and so it's really the -- what our culture is focused
on is this idea of growth mindset. And what that means is really being open to others
ideas. Satya says I want a company full of learn-it-alls not know-it-alls. I want people
who are open to criticism, who are comfortable giving their colleagues feedback,
trying to work together to make things better.
And I really, absolutely can feel it. The way we got there, so I think Satya did a great
thing when he came in. He went on a listening tour. He talked to his senior
leadership team. he talked to Board members, he talked to customers, he talked to
the top 200 leaders across the company, to talk about what does this company need
to do. And I think Satya is someone who has espoused growth mindset is, I used to
support him a long time ago. I was his HR leader and this is who he really is. He has
always been very open to other ideas. He has been very open to working open
platform with others. And I think that was tremendously helpful for sort of helping
Microsoft start on its transformation.
So anyway, he got all these people together and worked with the senior leadership
team to identify cultural pillars that they wanted to work on. So in addition to growth
mindset, we also focused on customer obsession which was important for Microsoft.
I think there were some sense that we had gotten a internally focused. We think a lot
about diversity and inclusion, which has been profound for us is something that
we're continuing to work on. I think we'll never be done. But just this idea of being
much more open in bringing in diﬀerent skill sets, diﬀerent points of view,
welcoming those perspectives.
And so, they aligned on culture and then we went on a journey to try to really ensure
that our programs and practices were aligned with that. And just this morning, there
was all employee Q&A. And I thought it was interesting for this. I wanted to share
with this audience. They actually shared a new culture video for us. So we've been
working on this for 6 years. And we're constantly trying to up our game and remind
people of what we're trying to do.
And I think the thing that Satya said that was great is, there is sort of this idea of an
espoused culture and espoused values and we want to make sure that our group
experience is close to that, that we're closing the gap on those things. And so there
is real focus. In my own world, I spent a lot of time thinking about my programs and
services and how I can support the culture. So a really big one is performance andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 12Q - Josh Baerdevelopment. And probably about 6 years ago, right about all this time that this was
happening, we shifted the performance and development approach from sort of a
monolithic annual review process to something that's more agile, where we do sort
of three to four connects a year, where manager and employee get together.
And within those connects, we have core priorities. So we ask people to think about
the three to ﬁve top things they have to do. And in addition to that, we have a share
diversity and inclusion core priority for the full company, that makes it very clear that
this is very important.
And then we also recently introduced a core priority for manager excellence, that's
another piece that we think is huge. About a year ago, we introduced something
called model coach and care for managers. This is the aspiration of how managers
lead. We had never spent a lot of time thinking about consistency of managers and
sort of thinking about teaching them how we want them to be. And in fact, we
consider them to be ambassadors for the culture. They are the ones who are sort of
the last mile culture, really and ensuring that they are managing in a way and trying
to help employees understand would aspire to culture looks like.
And so with the P&D system. The HR BI system, we measure insights on culture. We
have something called a culture index. So every program and service we have, it's
really in service of that.
The other thing I want to say about P&D is in the older days at Microsoft, it was very
much focused on individual. We used to have a forced distribution and really it's
sometimes focused on individual heroics, which at times was at the cost of working
together as a team. Now we really focus on what we call three circles.
So ﬁrst circle is really what you do as an individual to drive business in customer
outcomes. Then this next circle is what are you doing to help others. So what are you
doing to teach others, to help others with their things if you call it. Well, I think of it is
rewarding the assist. And then the third circle is what are you doing to leverage
others. And it used to be Microsoft's -- engineering teams used to be competitive
with each other and they wanted to build their own code instead of sharing code,
and that was not great for customers. And it was not great for us. And so our P&D
system is really, really grounded in the aspire to culture.
And there are many examples. But those are just a few of how we do it every day and
we're not done, and I loved that there was a new video today. So 6 years in and
we're still trying to push ourselves in culture.
{BIO 21368897 <GO>}
That's great. Want to ask one more on culture as well. I'll ask a few on the future of
work and then pass it over to Mark. So on sticking to culture for a moment and over
the last 15 months as you've been hiring and on boarding employees. How do you
keep that company culture that you've been describing when a lot of teams haven't
even met the people in person?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 12A - Kristen Roby Dimlow{BIO 19359533 <GO>}
Yes. This has been one of the happiest surprises to me about COVID. So I was
stunned to see data, that new employees are saying they basically are reading their
experience with our managers on, on-boarding higher post pandemic when
everything is virtual than they were before. And I think, I attribute that to the fact that
managers really understand that in these virtual environments. They need to lead in
really hard with new employees to get them up and productive.
And I also think, and this is a little bit of a scary thing as we think about the future of
work is many of us were working from home. And so we were all in the same boat.
And so one of the things we're thinking about really hard is when, how do we enable
a truly hybrid environment. How are we going to tweak our tools, so that people can
be calling in from Michigan or Atlanta and it feels the same as they were sitting in the
conference room. I think many of us at Microsoft and probably you all have
experienced this too, that pre-pandemic, the people who were in the room had a
slight advantage of the people online. A lot of times the people online you'd sort of
forget they were there. You'd start talking to all at once. Nobody could follow what
was going on. So I think that is maybe one of the reasons why the data was better
than I expected. And why new employees were doing so well.
And then we have a lot of training. So we have some mandatory trainings and then
we also have invested heavily in manager excellence. So we have a learning path for
all managers, which is 40 hours that they're expected to do over 18 months. And the
idea is really to inculcate some of these ideas around model coach and care. And
then also the culture attributes.
So, and then on the diversity inclusion side, I mean what are your we've had. I think
that the -- from the murder of George Floyd has really been a catalyst for us to re-up
our game on diversity and inclusion. And we have done a huge amount of work in
some of it. One of the things we do is we have mandatory allyship training, and 90%
of all employees have taken that, we're always hiring new employees. So some of
the catch-up is, some of those newer employees. But also we've done a lot of work,
which is more self-determination. So we did, for example, two-day include
conference, where we brought in experts from across the globe on issues like this.
And it was really opt-in for employees and they loved it.
And so I do think that, there have been these moments. It's sometimes challenge
brings opportunity and the challenge of COVID and the challenge of racial injustice
in the United States have really been also opportunities for us to double down and it
pays oﬀ, right, it's paying oﬀ. One of the things I think about is employee
engagement, and also when you're thinking about attracting talent today, it's not just
interested in compensation and beneﬁts. They care a lot about the companies they
work for. And they really are looking for companies that are sincerely behind what
they say, so not just what they say. But what they do on these matters.
So I get long winded, sorry.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09

No. Very interesting. And I know Mark has some follow-ups on diversity and
inclusion. Just wanted to round out the conversation on the future of work for
Microsoft speciﬁcally, and then we got -- we've got a preview and an overview of
that. I'm just wondering like, how this next year really compares to the last 15 months
and longer term. What is the working environment really look like for Microsoft?
{BIO 19359533 <GO>}
I think again, we have learned so much in the last year that some of the dinosaurs
like myself feel that there is a diﬀerent way of working. And I really feel like we are
leaning in hard on what we're calling hybrid, which is allowing more ﬂexibility into
the system. So, currently, if you're aligned with a Microsoft worksite, we're only
expecting a post what we call Stage 6 internally, which is when it's full return to be
oﬃce when it's safe to do so.
Employees really get to make a decision. They can -- they can work with their
manager to ﬂex their schedule, basically if you want to be part of a worksite, we'll
say, you only have to show up 50% of the time to be considered sort of full-time in
that worksite. You can work at home. That helps a lot in places where traﬃc is bad.
I think one of the things we've all learned from this work from home during the
pandemic is how much we hit our commutes, and how productive we have been by
not having to commute. So we're going to allow a little bit more ﬂexibility. We will
also allow some employees be fully remote. I've already had a number of employees
told me recently as we're getting closer and closer to where we think things may
return in the Puget Sound, a lot more people are saying, you know what, it's working
for me. Can do you really mute it, can I work really more remotely? And the answer is
yes.
And then also, we're ﬁnding that we're getting access to such better talent that --
that's helping us as well to be more ﬂexible. So you might have the best data science
in the world who doesn't want to leave main and so now we can make that happen.
So what we're trying to do is at the evangelize where are the guard rails are, we are
putting a lot of power in managers to make those decisions, but we're trying to give
them the data too, why this makes sense for them.
Deﬁnitely employees are more engaged, they are feeling. We're seeing that their
stickiness from a retention perspective when people have these opportunities to
control where and how they want to work. And then there's real challenges too. I
think one of our groups that was most impacted were the engineers and they really
like the opportunity or they have gotten used the opportunity of being face-to-face
and walking down the hall, grabbing a whiteboard work on a problem.
And so our Teams team is looking a lot at the future of work and trying to enable sort
of those virtual rooms. We have whiteboards and things like that, we have work to do
to make them even better. And then, even just thinking about meeting protocol, so
when we return and some people will be in a conference room, how do we makeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09

A - Kristen Roby Dimlowthat a really great experience for people who are physically there and not physically
there. So we're working hard on all of that.
But I think it's -- like, I do think that this is a huge silver lining is that it's really
changed attitudes, and we were even commenting that of Satya's senior leadership
team, four of them are not in the Puget Sound, and that's a big change culturally.
And I think it's better because it's really important for employees to see that the
leaders needed too.
{BIO 21368897 <GO>}
Great. Microsoft is the leader in hybrid cloud on the software side. So it's bidding
that, that you have a robust and ﬂexible hybrid strategy when it comes to the
workforce too. I'm going to pass it over to Mark.
{BIO 19359533 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Josh.
{BIO 21368897 <GO>}
Thank you, Kristen.
{BIO 20873048 <GO>}
Thanks Josh. And thanks, Kristen for doing this. We appreciate it. I just wanted to
follow up on some of the diversity comments you made earlier and my ﬁrst is,
through the turbulent social backdrop, we had over the past year. One, if you could
just elaborate on sort of what you did to support your employees? But two, when --
how does Microsoft go about thinking about when they should use their platform for
a voice of change?
{BIO 19359533 <GO>}
You know those are both great questions. So I think, when a year ago, when all of --
we had the George Floyd situation, we had Breonna Taylor, we had Ahmaud Arbery,
we've had Trayvon Martin like this is just continuing. But I feel like last year we hit a
crescendo. And what was terriﬁc is the senior leadership team got together. So Satya
and his direct reports got together and said, what do we do about this?
And then also, we have a very, very strong -- we have many strong ERGs, Employee
Resource Groups, but one of our strongest is the BAM community, which is Blacks at
Microsoft. And they also maintain. And the senior leadership team and sort of the
BAM leadership team got together and said, what can we do to ensure that our
employees feel supported and safe, and also what do we do as when we think of our
mission, our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the
planet to achieve more.
And so diversity and inclusion is core to us. And I think that we felt like we could do
more to support. And so anyway, they came out with statements and then we also
tried to not -- it's not -- I think one of the things I hear from the community is there'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 12Q - Mark Carlucci
A - Kristen Roby Dimlowsuch a fear of cynicism, where we have heard words before, and we want companies
who backup their words with real action. And so it's very important to the senior
leadership team and also HR leadership team and BAM leadership to think about
what are we going to do this diﬀerent.
And so we really thought about our response in terms of what do we do internally to
continue to improve the culture to also think about how we use our ecosystem. So
we have purchasing relationships, we have suppliers. We have investment
opportunity and then also what do we do with the community. So we have a big
platform, what can we do to pull all of that together to weigh in on this issue.
And internally, we did some mandatory trainings. We used June 10th as a day of
reﬂection. And in fact, we're going to continue that this year. So some companies
have chosen to give June 10th as a holiday and that's ﬁne. But we said no, for us, that
may be ﬁne for them. But for our company, we wanted it to be a day where people
could really think about their own journey and their own learning in this space.
And then again, we really used our employee listening systems to see what was
going on with employees and tried to equip managers and employees with
resources to help them through. So we do not have it all ﬁgured out. Again, we
spend a lot of times talking to other companies, trying to get a sense of what they're
doing. We've tried for many years to do more with pipeline. We want more diverse
hiring, and we have put some big investments in there and continue to do that. We
also unleashed our (inaudible) because I think a lot of employees were just so
frustrated, wanted to do more. So we added an extra amount of match for the world.
So that we increased our match and give people ideas of organizations, they can
contribute too, if they wanted to support these activities.
And then one of the biggest things we're doing is just trying to hold up the mirror to
ourselves. So from an accountability perspective, we put in some pretty aggressive
goals. And we are reporting on both internally and externally. And I was sharing on
one of our breakouts that if there is nothing in Microsoft with having a goal. I think if
you really want to get something done, you should light on it. And we hopefully --
people have had a chance to look at our diversity inclusion disclosure. I'd encourage
you to do it, but it's not all happy news. And we're willing to stand up and say, we're
trying really hard. Some things are working. Some are not. But anyway, that's a little
bit.
{BIO 20873048 <GO>}
Great. And I think we have time for one more question. So maybe I'll just build on
points just made around hiring. Just curious, I know we've talked about COVID a lot,
but just curious how that -- any challenges or how you dealt with that in terms of
trying to ﬁnd new talent in this backdrop?
{BIO 19359533 <GO>}
Great. It has been enormously challenging. And I -- my hats are oﬀ to everybody
involved especially my colleague who runs Microsoft Global Staﬃng. We, one
example of Herculean eﬀort was trying to -- we hire about 3,000 interns every yearFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09

A - Kristen Roby Dimlowand they had to although -- they all had to go virtual in a matter of weeks, and it
worked.
The other thing is like in the United States, you have to have proof of citizenship and
it's always been done in person. So you had to have humans check to ﬁll out I9
Forms and things like that. We also had always had in person onboarding or it was
primarily in person onboarding. So all of that had to be shifted online. And I'm
happy to say it went pretty well, given I'm sure there are few hiccups, one of the
things that's really challenging is we hire people from all over the world and in some
cases we were hiring somebody from one country to work in another country, and all
the border shutdown.
And so we have a number of people across the world right now, who were on dual
oﬀers and we're sort of waiting for borders to open. So we were, it deﬁnitely
necessity is the mother of invention. We scrambled and we ﬁgured it out and it was
not easy. And I'll also say burnout is a real thing, like I think people have worked so,
so hard. And I was really pleasantly surprised to see our annual engagement survey
like sentiment went up on just about everything except work life balance, which
tanked more than we ever side it was like down 10 points year-over-year. And it's not
surprising because of things like this. It's just really change the diﬃculty of work.
But I'd say the reason why the other things are up so high as people tremendous
sense of purpose and impact. And so that's helping. And we are trying really hard to
give employees the resources they need to take care of their own well-being. And

people start taking vacations and get a bit of a break.

So if anyone has questions, I'm kristend@microsoft.com, I'm also happy to answer
any questions.
