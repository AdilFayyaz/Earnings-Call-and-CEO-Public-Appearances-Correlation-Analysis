{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
I'm Joe Moore from the Morgan Stanley semiconductor franchise. Very excited to
have with us today Colette Kress from NVIDIA. Colette, you guys have been on a
really strong growth trajectory. You have outgrown most of our large-cap companies
in the last couple of years. Maybe we could just start out, just give us a bit of an
overview for what it is that you guys are doing and what has driven that growth rate.
Then we can dig in to some of the individual pieces.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. We've just actually ﬁnished our ﬁscal year, ﬁscal year 2016. And announced a
couple of weeks ago another very strong year for us. Our total revenue growth of
about 7% in a market which had been very challenged in terms of the
semiconductor. But what was key is really saying us fulﬁll what we had been working
on it terms of a transformation. A transformation away from being a chip component
company and focused on four speciﬁc, specialized markets. Those speciﬁc markets
being gaming, pro visualization, data center and cloud. And automotive.
So in the Fourth Quarter alone, each one of those four markets both grew year-over-
year as well as sequentially in there. But those four markets now represent more than
85% of our overall revenue. And them alone are growing more than 20% in terms of
overall growth. So we are focused on end-to-end platform for these individual
markets versus a component chip sale has really, really started our transformation.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. Great. So maybe we could look at some of those growth drivers little bit.
Maybe start with the biggest, which is gaming. Your PC graphics business is the
lion's share of the overall company revenues. You've been growing that gamingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29

Colette Kressportion between 20% and 50%, depending on the quarter, the last several quarters.
And you've seen this decline in traditional OEM PC. Can we dig into that little bit?
And maybe start with how do you categorize gaming? How do you decide what is
gaming and what is OEM? And how do you measure those shifts over time?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure, sure. When we think about our gaming businesses, our gaming business
represents more than 50% of our overall company revenue. The last two yours it has
probably grown more than 30%, 35% year on year in each of those years. That was a
decision to really focus on that end customer, the gamer. And providing them a full
ecosystem around their overall gaming experience. The use of a discrete GPU for PC
gaming is the standard. It is what is necessary because of the increased production
value of the games that are now out on the market. And continuing to see the
market, the overall gaming experience, continues to rise in terms of that need.
So that has been our focus of providing the drivers, the updates, the understanding
of how to compete in that overall gaming market. And where we look at this is to
focus on our GPU experience in terms of those are our gamers that are actually
phoning home or signing into our overall subscription. And we can see a good list of
those of more than 75 million, almost 80 million of them that are registered. So that
gives us a good understanding of our installed base. It gives us a good
understanding of what they're using the overall GPU for, which we can see in terms
of gaming using our GTX platform, is probably the most common use case. That's
how we primarily diﬀerentiate to show what that gaming is.
Now, the overall mainstream OEM business is still some volume in terms of absolute
overall size of GPU units that are sold. But it's not necessarily a workload that you will
see a discrete GPU be used. It becomes a very competitive component market,
whether or not you need a discrete GPU. We deal with the duopoly or the option in
terms of an integrated as well. So it's becoming a lesser and lesser portion of our
overall business. Maybe threes ago was probably more than 40%, 45%, of our
overall business; now it is less than 10% as we really focused on gaming.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
And just maybe you could help us understand what that is, what those users are
using the GPU for. Because I tend to think of, three years ago, still you were already
at the point to buy a discrete GPU you had to seek it out. And you had to be
somebody who really valued that. Which I think of that as being a gaming audience.
So what is that large, non-gaming OEM unit base that is declining? But what are
those users using it for? And is it just a legacy of where you have been historically?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. The workload will be -- if they -- some of them wanting the same type of
capabilities that they have in the enterprise in a consumer. Some enterprise
workstations, meaning certain applications for that. But again, it's not a very large
audience that will be there. They will use it maybe as a test environment. But again,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 14Joe Moore

Joe Moore
Colette Kressmost of the focus on the PC is going to be related to gaming. And that takes up the
majority share of both the revenue and our focus strategically.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. And that 30% type of growth that you have been seeing in gaming, I know you
won't give any speciﬁcs, because I ask you this every time we meet. But a little bit of
a qualitative sense of how much of that is price, how much of that is share gain, do
you think, versus underlying unit growth of the market?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. It's actually all of the three. Our focus in terms of increasing the overall TAM of
gamers that are out there continues to be an area of focus as we look at areas of
emerging markets where access to broadband continues to expand. So our overall
units have continued to grow as we have expanded the market for PC gaming.
Secondly, when we look at the overall ASPs. So it's also been a great focus. The
production value of those games and it increasing has driven people to enter into
the market either as new users at a higher price point than maybe where they had
started several years ago. The overall upgrades that we also see as they move to the
new architectures have been also entering at a higher price point. So we've seen a
nice increase in terms of those overall ASPs.
We have gained a bit of share. We have a good amount of the discrete GPU share in
total. But the overall high-end gamers have -- tend to be with NVIDIA for quite some
time. So most of the share gains have probably been in the medium to the low end,
over all the gamers, all grades. But I would still focus on unit growth and ASP growth
being probably the two largest contributors to our growth.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. And one of the things that surprised me about the ASP growth in the high end
is that you have done that with 28 nanometer silicon, which has been pretty long in
the tooth at this point. You obviously have, since that product's come, you haven't
given us a lot of color on those yet. But any sense for what that might do to your
average selling price, getting those products into the market?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Correct. So we have been selling our Maxwell architecture for more than two years,
going on 2 1/2 years. The key part of that is we have introduced new cards
throughout that 2 1/2 period of time. So not all of the cards are at a two year in terms
of overall life. We've continued to see upgrades to the overall Maxwell architecture
for gaming. But what has been interesting is we still probably have more than 65%,
70%, of our overall installed base that has not yet upgraded to Maxwell. So there's
still an opportunity. And they are continuing to buy into the overall Maxwell
architecture.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29

Joe Moore
Colette KressWe did announce a year ago that our Pascal new architecture across the company is
coming. And we will have more insight into that this year. I'm sure that we'll talk
more. Yes. It is overall FinFET. So we will talk about in terms of how those products
roll out. But there is a great opportunity with Maxwell as well as what we have
coming in Pascal.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. And I guess then the big of all this is, what happens when OEM is gone? It is
going to be a 30% growth business. Or is there a mix change at least -- what do you
think of the growth rate once we get to a maturity where that OEM business is not
the (multiple speakers)?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. I think the OEM business, outside of gaming, will probably be there at some
level, for some time. It's not necessarily yet at a growth position yet but it will
probably stabilize as an underlying need for just some basic types of workloads. But
the over growth of the gaming, we still see a strong TAM in front of us. We see a
TAM, just based on the main driver of what drives PC gaming, which is games. The
stronger the pipeline that we see in gaming, the stronger that we believe the overall
hardware that is going to need to drive that overall gaming which will be necessary.
So we see this growth continuing.
The introduction of a new architecture, again, is another upgrade opportunity. We
see virtual reality also on the horizon. That can also be a driver in terms of the overall
upgrades as well. So a lot of great things going forward. PC gaming in terms of TAM
externally, sources have probably predicted near double digits in terms of overall
growth. We don't have an exact science on that. But again, we see deﬁnitely a TAM
growing, going forward.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. Mostly I want this to be an opportunity for you guys to your tell your story, not
to focus on how long I've been. But we've looked at some of the software data that
shows, yay, Activision takes [ph] Ubisoft in aggregate. Their PC gaming revenues
aren't growing that fast. They are growing even more like low single digits. It's not
crazy that hardware would grow faster than software in that environment. Is it
dependent on an upgrade cycle? Or how do you continue to outpace just the
growth of software sales?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. There is an outpacing ability, just based on the actual card that they choose for
that overall software. What is intriguing about PC gaming, the exact same game can
have a completely diﬀerent experience just based on the overall GPU that they
desire. That becomes almost a competitive opportunity for the individual gamers
playing against their friends. And they really can overall, just with an existing set of
games, go and update that overall hardware.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 14Joe Moore
Colette Kress
Joe Moore
Colette KressSo it's not uncommon to see that overall harbor potentially growing faster than some
of the individual overall software players. But when you look at the amount of actual
software that is out there, with one single piece of hardware that leverages across
any of that, that growth can potentially be higher.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. Great. And the other thing that has been impressive about your growth is that
you have done it with a fair amount of exposure to emerging markets that are going
through a little bit of a headwind. Could you talk a little bit about that? And do you
see, looking forward, are you focused on currency as a risk? Are you focused on
macro as a risk? How do you think about those (multiple speakers)?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Our growth in terms of gaming has actually been quite solid across all three of
our regions: the US, the European region, as well as our Asia Pac and overall China
regions. We are able to monetize quite well in all three of those. And the growth
rates, with just a little bit of seasonality between the two, has been growing steady in
all three of them.
Our growth in terms of our emerging markets, as well as what we had seen in
Europe, about a year ago just due to the large FX swings, wasn't necessarily aﬀecting
the overall gaming purchases at all. We still saw gamers look at the capital markets
but feel that gaming was still a strong priority for overall entertainment from them.
We watch it closely in terms of that. But gaming has still been quite strong through
these market conditions that we have seen.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Then just to ﬁnish up on the gaming, questions -- you mentioned virtual
reality. Obviously, virtual reality is pretty cool. It's expensive. I feel like there's a big
long-term opportunity. How do you think about the rate of adoption, 2016, 2017?
And obviously it is going to drive a very high GPU sale for somebody who doesn't
already have one. So if you could just talk a little bit about that.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So VR we look at as a bonus. To help everybody understand in terms of what is
needed to partake in the high level virtual reality that you see, it is generally tethered
to a high-end PC. The high-end PC in terms of minimum specs that would make that
experience a good experience is one of our top three GPUs that we sell. So
essentially a GTX 970 or overall higher. We look at this as a great opportunity for
either existing gamers to upgrade or a new cast of them to potentially enter into the
overall gaming market with that.
It's a little uncertain for us. We don't have any more information regarding the
number of units that will be available, its uptake. But we look at it as just anotherFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29

Joe Moorereason to continue the higher level of gaming that is out there in the market.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. Makes sense. Maybe moving on then to the data center part of your business.
In that business, including Tesla and GRID, about 7% of your revenues, grew 70% in
2014, grew high single digits last year. Can you talk about where that growth is
coming from? And should we think of that as being a high performance compute
oriented business or a cloud centric business, or more moving from one to the
another?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Absolutely. It's actually both. Our data center business concentrates on a couple
diﬀerent things that are happening in the data center. The overall high-performance
computing arena has been there for several years and continues to grow
consistently. We discussed some theorems of Supercomputing 2015 back in the late
fall. The amount of applications that are now using accelerated computing to overall
improve their workload. And work load throughput continues to grow. Nine out of
the 10 top 10 high-performance computing applications are now using acceleration.
And NVIDIA's GPUs are one of the key ones for that overall acceleration.
So you are going to continue to see that be a core component of our data center
and the overall growth. But what we saw over at least over the last 18 months. And
deﬁnitely a focus in the second half of the year, is the focus on the hyperscale overall
service providers using GPUs for deep learning training or essentially artiﬁcial
intelligence of deep neural networks, in terms of providing additional information,
very user speciﬁc, or service application speciﬁc things. Things that you see such as
video encoding, voice recognition, voice translation -- these are very popular types
of large data sets but using overall GPUs to scale those overall applications for better
use for the overall user.
So those have been key projects and key areas in terms re-focus. You have seen us
focused with both Google, Facebook, Alibaba, Baidu, all across the world in terms of
key projects where there are using this deep learning training. Which has driven a lot
of our overall growth. But it does come in in terms of lumpy types of projects. But it
is a clear focus that we think in terms of growing our TAM going forward. And
growing our overall revenue.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. And in the GRID portion of that business, where you are looking at actually
virtualizing that GPU capability, both in enterprise and in consumer, that is now
being -- it is in the same segment as other HPCs. But I don't want to lose visibility on
that segment because it seems pretty interesting. (multiple speakers) Can you talk a
little bit about that opportunity? And you are you more excited about enterprise type
deployments, or the consumer infrastructure as a service?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29

Page 7 of 14Colette Kress
Joe Moore
Colette Kress{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
They are both. And we have seen a great interest both from service providers, both
Microsoft, AWS, provide that ability of using it for overall streaming capabilities to
key workloads. But we've also expanded tremendously in terms of key enterprises,
who are also interested in using GRID for virtualized workstations, virtualized PCs, or
speciﬁc overall applications. Our progress in terms of working with VMware and
Citrix has continued to grow. And we will see this developed going forward.
But it is a long cycle. Deﬁnitely with the business units in a lot of these enterprises
working with VM and Citrix. And actually putting it into overall production. But again,
we are seeing strong interest, strong growth because it really does solve a lot of
problems of the global workforce and wanting to have a clear value of providing this
workstation in the cloud.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Thank you very much. So maybe if we then move onto the Tegra
opportunity, which if we were having this conversation two years ago, it would of
been largely about smartphones and tablets. And autos would be an afterthought. It
has become largely an automotive opportunity. Can you talk a little bit about that?
And can you talk about -- the CES presentations that you guys did were largely
oriented around autos. But it was very focused on DRIVE PX and kind of future ASPs.
Can you diﬀerentiate all those between where your revenue is today and where that
opportunity is going?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Our Tegra business, probably the largest business unit underneath our Tegra
segment is automotive. We have been in the automotive business for more than 8 to
10 years focusing on key designs in infotainment for these high-end cars.
Infotainment as it relates to center console and/or digital dashboards. But really that
high-end visual computing capabilities that you see across Audi, BMW. And a lot of
other really high-end types of cars. That's been driving our overall revenue.
We have more than 10 million cars on the road today. We have a pipeline of more
than 25 million yet to go just based on the existing design wins that we've had. We
have approximately an ASP of probably around $50 to $100 each for diﬀerent
modules, what's inside those cars. So the growth rate has really been both the
success that we have in those auto manufacturers understanding the importance of
this key technology; people really thrive to that. And our focus has been to continue
to build out to virtual dashboards as we think about in the future.
But you are correct: our focus as we talked about at CES is really the long-term
channel opportunity of autonomous driving. No one goes anywhere without a key
headline in terms of a newspaper and the interest of self-driving cars, really because
of the overall disruption of the technology that this would be in the next 20 years.
Will there actually be cars on the road driven individually by humans? But our focusFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 14Joe Moore
Colette Kress
Joe Mooreis very diﬀerent in terms of what we are providing for infotainment systems and what
we want to provide for autonomous cars.
Autonomous driving cars are a focus on essential compute, the central
supercomputer. And taking that exact same learning that we learned in our data
center work in terms of deep neural networks to overall determine everything that
surrounds the overall car. All that data, all of that network information to create a
database for that self-driving car going forward. So we couldn't be more pleased in
terms of our platform and our platform interest, which is essentially a data center for
the car.
And the amount of work that we are doing with tier 1 manufacturers, overall tier 1
suppliers, as well as key startups and researchers that are approaching this problem
quite interestingly. It is going to be a question in terms of what happens ﬁrst. We will
continue to see ADAS opportunities continue to develop in the market and merge
with autonomous driving going forward.
But you will also probably see where transportation as a service as we focus on those
really want to change whether or not there's actually a person behind that wheel that
are driving others around. And focusing that on just truly starting at autonomous
driving, rather than not having the ADAS. So it's going to be a question in terms of
what happens ﬁrst. But our focus really is the central compute for those types of
oﬀerings.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. So maybe if move through that chronologically. So the business that you serve
today obviously is going to grow quickly because you have a lot of cars with dials
and knobs moving to a virtualized cockpit. How far are we, do you think, through that
transition? And how competitive do you think that market is? Qualcomm made a fair
amount of noise about penetrating Audi in those applications. Should we think of
that as being a market where win the socket and keep it for many years, like the
traditional auto business? Or could it be more competitive than that?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. I think at the high end, it would still be very, very competitive. Really moving to,
at some point, it's just a screen. It's not knobs. It's not dials in any part of that car.
And that's where our expertise and our focus is. Sure, there's an opportunity to make
it a standard component and oﬀering in every single car. But you are going to
probably move in terms of the low-end, not necessarily a part that we are going to
focus on; really focus on that virtual dashboard as it moves collectively with
autonomous driving. And we think there is deﬁnitely opportunity going forward for
expansion in terms of the overall technology that we have there.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29

Page 9 of 14Colette Kress
Joe Moore
Colette KressOkay. Then thinking about the ADAS opportunity, am I wrong to think of that as
almost two diﬀerent opportunities? There's one which is the deep learning, where --
and you have this Global 100 program were you have 100 cars with GPUs. And I'm
going around gathering data, building up the analytics capability to compete with
guys who develop that one picture of the time. Is that separate from the ADAS
opportunity, where you have a GPU in a car in every -- one in every car that has the
ADAS system in it. Is there the data collection analytics opportunity that is separate?
Or will that necessarily lead to volume down the road?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So let's talk more about the probably the ﬁrst, because I think that's a better
understanding of using an example like Volvo. We had announced that Volvo will, on
their 100 ﬁrst piloted cars, use our DRIVE PX platform that will come out probably in
about 2017 and on the road. But there's a set of things that we provide to them that
we actually allow them to build that overall neural network. So an overall digit spot
[ph] that enables them to take their data, any data that we provide, together to
create that training environment that will eventually go in terms of the car.
We continue to work with them at the development platform layer. We have
development tools to help them in terms of the algorithms and build out how you
want the car to react and go forward. Then, lastly, there's actually the DRIVE PX that
we will actually be included in the car, probably the trunk; a lunchbox-sized that
actually is running that processing actually in the car. That is primarily where our
focus is.
We do still have some ADAS as well. You have seen Audi in zFAS, as that was
announced not this last CES. But the CES before, where they are again using that
processing power, building algorithms in terms of there. So there's two overall
funnels in terms of how we will get to autonomous driving. But we've really focused
primarily on that overall supercomputer. And kept focus.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
And how do the automakers' desires ﬁt into this? Because I feel like when we talk to
them, a lot of them are striving to add value in their own right. They want to be able
to add on top of the platform that you are providing them. Is that something that you
are focused on. And are you -- how open are you to doing semi-custom type
products in this market, if customers want you to?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. I think the work that we have seen with the traditional car manufacturers is those
that are really interested in understanding that the technology and the software
incorporated in these cars going forward is essential. The centralization of that, the
centralization management, that is their core to them. That is their soul in terms of
what be the car the future. So our best work has been those that fully understand the
importance of the safety, the overall security. And that centralization of the software.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 14Joe Moore
Colette KressAnd that's where the overall joint work has been. Our ability to provide a consistent
platform for them, a set of development tools, in order for them to enable that
software layer, has been very, very key for them going forward. You'll probably see us
with many development contracts as we go forward, before it is actually a platform
or a module actual sale in terms of working collectively with them.
That's where we think those key manufacturers are really focused on. In the same
manner of the startups, in terms of how do we get a single platform for their entire
car. So not necessarily working what they traditionally have had, because they
haven't been in the industry for 50 years. And approaching it in a new manner of
how you start. Start with the overall computer platform and build on top of that.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. I just I have one more Tegra question. And then we can open it to the
audience. An unrelated Tegra question: a couple of years ago you did have this view
that tablets would evolve such that they need high-end graphics. And I actually still
think that makes a lot of sense. And it hasn't really happened yet. But how big of a
focus is that for you guys? You have the SHIELD, which is an eﬀort to evangelize that.
But how do you get ultimately software to be written for a GPU and it's how the -- I
feel like a lot of the development activity is let's develop this for iPad and port it to
an Android platform.
And so giving them a superset of graphics functionality versus what is in an iPhone
or an iPad hasn't really done very much. Is there a prospect for that to change? And
how much do you guys internally still think about that, a more GPU intensive
smartphone or tablet environment?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. I think it relates back to our overall gaming environment. PC gaming, one of the
strengths is the overall performance that you have. And what we have enabled [ph]
to do even in this last year is focus on the mobility of overall gaming. For example,
notebook gaming, notebook speciﬁc gaming machines have been an extremely
popular area, particularly leading into the holidays. The OEMs had clearly seen PC
gaming, the overall market, continue to expand and be. And building speciﬁc high-
end notebooks for that mobility of a gamer has been a key area, particularly as we
even lead towards virtual reality.
Virtual reality with a high-end notebook has also been something that they have
expanded to. But that builds exactly to tablets as well. Moving from a PC to a
notebook to a tablet, in order to do that type of mobile type of gaming, will continue
to grow. Wanting to game everywhere, want that ease-of-use, in terms of a tablet -- a
tablet potentially connect to a monitor, a screen, a TV in order to do that.
Our SHIELD is a prime example of that. It also takes advantage of our capabilities to
provide the high-end streaming collectively to ﬁnish oﬀ that full oﬀering. So we willFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29

mobility of gaming and how it will grow going forward.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. Let me see if we have questions from the audience. We have eight more
minutes.
Questions And Answers
Just a question on the competition, maybe speciﬁcally Intel after acquisition of
Altera. And Altera has been vocal about trying to go after some of your markets
before the acquisition. How do you see that playing out? And is that a threat in some
of your growth markets?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Altera and many other potential forms of accelerated computing in the data
center has existed for many years. Altera, other forms of that. The GPU and what we
have seen in our sales so far has been the GPU is, bar none, probably the strongest
capable in term of accelerated computing in the data center. One of the key pieces
in terms of why is its overall programmability. If you recall several years ago, we
enabled CUDA on every single one of our overall GPUs in the market. We had gone
out to universities, research institutions. And trained on the overall capabilities of
using CUDA.
So although an ASIC type of approach with Altera is a possibility in terms of
conﬁgurability, it is not programmable. So we haven't necessarily seen them in our
overall markets as we have focused really on key, key customers that are using the
overall GPUs because they overall know the overall performance capability of a GPU.
And that ease-of-use in terms of programming. But we do understand there's
deﬁnitely diﬀerent ways to actually do accelerated computing.
And Intel competes within GPU compute as well.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
They do.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
But they have topped at midteens market share thus far, at least.

Page 12 of 14Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Colette Kress
A - Joe Moore
A - Colette KressYes. Again, it really comes down in terms of sometimes the software and the overall
capabilities of being able to expand that out. As we talked about at Supercomputing
2015, accelerated computing is a very, very top area. And the reason is Moore's Law
will likely reach its max capabilities, or essentially slow down and maybe go to zero.
So there's a huge interest in terms of accelerating the overall throughput in terms of
overall data centers. And with that work, what you saw was a focus of new
accelerated data centers, or supercomputers in the world, grow substantially. But we
still have more than 70%, 75%, of the overall share of the top supercomputers in the
world using NVIDIA for that overall acceleration.
I was hoping you could clarify for us some of the recent comments on the 50-50 split
on the last call between training and inference. And just how you think about
ultimately the inference market, given that historically that is more of a cost
optimized compute acceleration market? Does that come in a unit, a revenue, proﬁt
pool? Overall, how do you think about that? Thanks.

So what we are referring to here in the overall deep learning and artiﬁcial intelligent
works that we see with the overall hyperscales. What we want is a consistency of
moving that from the overall training environment to actually in production, using
the same set. We have already seen some initial work with those doing complex
translation of language translation. And the necessity of the overall GPU for those
types of inference environments. And we've seen some of the hyperscales come out
talking about using the GPUs in those inference.
But we also came out with what we referred to as the M Series back in late fall. Now
the M Series takes a smaller form factor of an overall GPU, about the size of a large
overall candy bar. And also taking a lower overall power consumption oﬀering. Now,
the key piece of this would be for it to exist in terms of existing data center
conﬁgurations. We needed to ﬁnd a key slot that they can add on the overall GPU
capabilities into those. So that M Series is just right for that type of work in terms of
inference. And we will see that continue to roll out.
We just announced it the end of the fall. And it is a key component to move into the
new year.

More questions from the audience? Maybe you could give us an update on the
Samsung litigation. You had some early setbacks there. Just where do you stand now
with that?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So our Samsung litigation work is still in progress. You are correct. Probably a
little disappointed in some of the initial rulings from the ITC in the initial case. Just
last week we heard back regarding the case where Samsung sued us, where theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29

pleased about that next part of the outcome. But we will see these cases through.
And it's a little unsure in terms of how the actual legal system will play out in terms of
here. But I think it is true to say that we feel that infringing on our products or using
our products without monetization and our overall IP is not something that we would
like to see. But we will be careful and thoughtful as we go forward. This wasn't to
create a business unit for litigation. It was really an important decision that we felt in
terms of defending our IP which is underneath our products. So we have a little bit of
a ways to go in terms of the existing agreements, as I said.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Understood. Okay. I can see one more question in the back. And let's ﬁnish up after
that.
Very quickly, I was looking for some -- a little bit more context on the 25 million unit
pipeline ﬁgure. I was curious what that looked like a year ago, how much it has
grown. And what the average duration of that is. And I assume the vast majority, 95%
of that plus, is still infotainment (multiple speakers).
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So our focus in terms of car manufacturers and models and continuing to grow the
pipeline -- what you will tend to see us do is expand on to the number of
manufacturers that we are working with. So we have announced the increase in
terms of Honda, with Daimler. And our continued work with Audi, BMW, Tesla, many
of the high-end Bentleys, others in terms of those pieces.
What is interesting about those relationships is that is a continued model for them to
use a platform that they've already approved in terms of the design. And work in
terms of additional models. And we will continue to see that. But you will see them
move our modules all the way across many of their models within type there.
So the 25 million is ﬂuid. It continues to grow both in terms of revenue that we have
received in this last year, as well as an addition as they ﬁne tune the overall models
that will go forward, going. So that is a continued growing model. There is still an
opportunity. It is not set in stone, where they will continue to switch in terms of the
models that they will go into.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
We will wrap up there. Colette, thank you very much.
