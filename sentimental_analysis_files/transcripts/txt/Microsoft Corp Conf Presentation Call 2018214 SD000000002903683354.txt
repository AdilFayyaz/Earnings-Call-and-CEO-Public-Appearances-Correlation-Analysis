Presentation
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
All right. Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us. I'm going to read a
brief safe harbor before we get going and do the introduction. But before we begin,
Microsoft may make some forward-looking statements during this presentation. And
you should refer to their SEC ﬁlings for the risk factors relating to their business. And
that's true, whether you're here in person or listening on the webcast. So we got the
legal part of it out of the way.
So the slide says Microsoft, right? But we're actually here to talk about LinkedIn and
how the acquisition is working out. And we've got Jeﬀ Weiner, who is no stranger to
this stage. He's been at every one of the Goldman Sachs tech conferences since
LinkedIn went public. He is the Chief Executive Oﬃcer of LinkedIn. And I think he's
got some really interesting stuﬀ to share. So thank you, Jeﬀ, for coming.
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
Thanks for having me.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So I guess, for those who are newer to the story, can you give us a brief overview of
kind of what brought the 2 companies together?
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
So when Satya and I ﬁrst sat down to talk about ways in which Microsoft and LinkedIn
could work together, there were a number of commercial areas that we thought
might make sense. And as the conversation continued, it became clear that...FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-14

This was a partnership, though, right? You started out --
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
It was a partnership. It wasn't -- we didn't sit down and immediately started talking
about M&A. We had always, to some extent, been on Microsoft's radar, I think, going
way back predating Satya. And conversations never really materialized and
amounted to much outside of having a good working relationship. And similarly,
when we ﬁrst sat down, Satya and I, it was a discussion about commercial
opportunities and ways in which we could potentially partner. And the longer the list
grew, the more the conversation kind of shifted and morphed into should we talk
about what it would mean to combine entities. And as that conversation progressed,
we both agreed that it would only make sense to continue the conversation and get
more serious if we had alignment on at least 2 dimensions, one was the sense of
purpose that drove the companies and the other was structure, organizationally how
this would work. And on the subject of purpose, it was interesting, because after
Satya became the CEO of Microsoft, Satya and the leadership team actually revised
the mission statement for the company, which is now to empower every individual
and organization on the planet to achieve more. And that's actually quite similar to
our mission statement, which is to connect the world's professionals to make them
more productive and successful. Now the words are a bit diﬀerent.
But fundamentally, we're trying to do the same thing. We've just gone about it very
diﬀerently, Microsoft, through their software and increasingly to cloud; and LinkedIn
through our professional network. But there's very strong alignment in terms of the
impact, we believe, these companies and these assets can have on LinkedIn's
membership, on Microsoft's customer base and, really, the, responsibility that both
companies have in the world, given the times that we live in, in terms of, not only
increasing productivity. But ensuring that every member of the global workforce has
access to economic opportunity. It's something that is codiﬁed at LinkedIn's vision
statement. And I know that's something that Satya and the leadership team at
Microsoft also believe very, very strongly in. And under Satya's leadership, Microsoft
has become increasingly purpose-driven. And it's something that comes very
naturally to him. It's very authentic. And I would say the same of the entire leadership
team at Microsoft. And that was a learning for me. I wasn't as familiar with that sense
of purpose prior to sitting down with him. So we had alignment on that front,
surprisingly strong alignment. Then we turned the discussion towards how this
would be structured.
And I had no idea what he was going to propose, I had no idea what he was going
to say. And it may have been relocating the company up to Redmond and asking me
to move up there. And I had no idea. And he said he's been giving us a lot of
thought in terms of how we would potentially structure an acquisition of this kind of
scale and scope. And he said, "I want to try things diﬀerently. And I'd like for
LinkedIn, if it's going to materialize, to remain independent." And I half-jokingly said,
"You had me at independent." And the model was really -- you take a look at success
that Facebook has had with Instagram, that Google has had with YouTube. And those
companies and organizations have operated almost entirely independent. I think,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 14Q - Heather Anne Bellini
A - Jeﬀrey Weinertoday, many, many years later, YouTube is probably a bit more integrated into the
way Google is overseen. But for years, it operated as a completely independent
entity. And that's still the case today, for the most part, with Instagram. And they both
have had extraordinary success post acquisition. Now in our case, Instagram had
something on the order of 13 employees at the time of the acquisition.
And YouTube was probably several hundred. We had 11,000 plus employees. And it
was a more mature company in terms of the number of years that we had been
around. So there was some question as to whether or not that kind of independence
model would work at our scale and with a company that has been established for as
long as we have at the time of the announcement. And Satya was true to his word.
He'd been true to every word we discussed that day and then some in terms of his
level of conviction around, not only independence but, how we prioritize the
LinkedIn post acquisition, which starts with growing LinkedIn. And it's to accelerate
the realization of our mission, our vision, our core objectives and to do it in a way
that's consistent with the way the business has been operated to date. We have the
same mission, the same vision, same culture, the same value, the same leadership
team. And the objectives have grown over time with some of the discussions we've
had. But it's, to a large extent, the same company.
And that level of independence post an acquisition like this, it takes a lot of work. But
not necessarily in the way people think of work and rolling up your sleeves and
initiatives and so forth and so on. I can get to that a little bit later. But this was work in
terms of communication cascading and maintaining consistency and alignment. And
it requires tremendous conviction. And not erring from that -- and by the way, that's
not just coming from Satya and Microsoft's leadership. Interestingly enough, it's
coming from me and LinkedIn's leadership because people on our team had certain
expectations as to how this would operate. And when they were meeting with their
Microsoft counterparts, just assuming at times that they should be prioritizing
diﬀerently. And so we constantly had to reinforce the importance of operating
independently and continuing to pursue the objectives that we had always laid out
for the company. And so you fast-forward, we announced, it was June 13, 2016, we
closed -- I think, it was around December 8, 2016, closed oﬃcially. So now we're
about 14 months into this. And we're pleased with the results. We had very high
hopes and expectations going into it. And it's exceeded those expectations.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Can you share a little bit -- I mean, I think Satya took a diﬀerent tack when the
acquisition happened. I thought it was really interesting what you were sharing last
week when we spoke about how he talked to you about how the integration would
go. Can you share his strategy behind that?
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
Yes. This was a page out of a playbook that I was not familiar with, to put it mildly. So
we've done a lot of M&A at LinkedIn. And I started at Yahoo! in core dev. So I'm fairly
familiar with diﬀerent M&A models and integration models. But about a week after
the announcement back in June of 2016, Satya sent me an e-mail and said, "I've
been giving a lot of thought to how we're going to handle the integration." AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 14Q - Heather Anne Bellini
A - Jeﬀrey Weinerwhile traditionally, there are 2 integration teams, one from the acquired company,
one from the acquiring company and the acquired company's integration team will
typically answer to the acquiring company. It's just how it works, no surprise there.
He said, "I'd like to do things a bit diﬀerently in this case. I'd like for there to be 1
acquisition integration team. And I'd like you to oversee it." So I did -- I think I
probably did that literally as I read that e-mail and then I had to reread it a couple of
times to make sure I was interpreting it right. Then I still wasn't certain. So I gave him
a call and said, "I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying. Are you
asking me to oversee the acquisition integration?" And he said, "Yes. Like I said, I'd
like to try things diﬀerently. And I think you are in a position where you know what's
best for LinkedIn.
And I'd like you to help coordinate and oversee a singular team comprised of
executives and employees from both companies." And I said, "You got it. Sure. I'd be
happy to." And he's pulled other pages from a playbook that, for me at least, is
somewhat unprecedented in a deal like this. Our head of technology, a guy named
Kevin Scott, had been an intern at Microsoft a couple of decades ago, really talented
guy. And after the acquisition was announced, we were talking about career paths.
And then he said, "You know, it would be literally a dream come true if I had the
opportunity to be the CTO of Microsoft." And he said, "You think something like that
would be possible?" I said, "There's only one way to ﬁnd out." And it turned out that
Satya was very open to the idea of ﬁlling that role. It's not always a ﬁlled seat at
Microsoft. There have been times when they had a CTO and times when they have
none, it's gone, it's vacant. And I mentioned the idea and Satya said, "Let me give it
some thought. It's interesting. Wanted to make sure we had thought it all the way
through." And over roughly 4- to 6-week period, he decided that made sense. Then
our head of technology became the CTO of Microsoft. So these are things that you
don't typically see in a situation like this. And I think they all add up. I think it makes
all the diﬀerence in the world.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And that's a good segue to talk about kind of how you've seen LinkedIn perform
versus your expectations since the deal closed. Can you -- I think there's a lot of
people wondering in the room and I think you've got a lot of talk about there.
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
Yes, sure. So 2016. So my folks at the onset of 2016, the guidance that we gave The
Street, that was the ﬁrst time we were giving guidance in terms of 2016. It was not
what The Street was expecting. There was steep sell oﬀ in the stock. And that decel,
from a growth rate perspective, continued. And it continued through the end of
2016. We actually saw some further declines, more so than we might have
anticipated by the end of 2016. And those are being baked into our plan as part of
Microsoft. And in 2017, things were going just about according to plan for the ﬁrst 2
quarters. Some areas slight outperformance, some areas slight underperformance
and some gaps that we were open to close. But it was the Third Quarter calendar '17
where we started to see some upticks. And our CFO, Steve Sordello, said, "You know,
my instincts tell me there may be some possibilities here for acceleration. And
anything that would stabilize that growth rate and then any uptick, even a few
hundred basis points, I think would have been welcome." And sure enough, weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 14Q - Heather Anne Bellini

Q - Heather Anne Bellini
A - Jeﬀrey Weinerstarted to see acceleration. It started with engagement. And we are essentially an
enterprise business that's built on top of the consumer platform. And we have
multiple business lines.
We have a Talent Solutions line; very much enterprise business; we have marketing
solutions; our e-ad [ph] sales, which is tied very much to engagement and the
inventory that's created -- the ad inventory that's created through engagement. We
have a premium business. And that funnel is largely driven by engagement, sales
solutions, learning solutions, et cetera. And when engagement is listed at LinkedIn,
it's a tide that lifts all boats, to the extent the individual business lines are then
improving their own business, their business model, their products and services,
their go-to-market strategies and we get compounding eﬀects. And so the very ﬁrst
uptick came from engagement. And it was a byproduct, in large part, of investments
we had been making over the prior, call it, 6, 12, 18 months in terms of a completely
redesigned mobile experience then a redesigned desktop experience that created a
lot more alignment between the 2, not only in terms of the user experience. But in
terms of the way in which we develop products, which was a big deal in terms of
productivity and in terms of accelerating innovation.
We had been making and continue to make aggressive investment in our feed. And
we're starting to see record levels in traﬃc in the feed through curated packages and
video and greater relevancy models. We overhauled our inbox and created a far
more modern way of communicating on LinkedIn. It was way overdue. But we're now
all in on messaging and we stripped out the old inbox. Then we invested in our
active job seeker use case as opposed to just passive candidates, people who are
actively seeking a job, which is something we had shied away from. And underlying
the growth, we started to see in these 3 essential areas for our members, was a
notiﬁcations ecosystem that while hardly perfected, we started to make tremendous
progress on in terms of understanding where to optimize for both relevancy and
frequency. And so all told, as a result of that, we started to see a fairly substantial lift
and engagement. And it just keeps building. So this third calendar year of 2017, we
started to see what had been a gap in terms of our engagement expectations as
measured by sessions, was reversed with no longer a gap or a surplus. Then it
started to materially be planned in expectations. Then the businesses started to
follow suit. And we've now seen acceleration 3 quarters in a row.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
On top line?
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
On top line, also with regard to engagement. Engagements got big enough where
even a few hundred basis points of downtick is still wildly..
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Just for the audience. How do you measure engagement? How are you measuring...

A - Jeﬀrey WeinerSessions. And that's a great question. So historically we had measured via unique
users and page views, which we lamented time and time again. It was something we
introduced at a time of the public oﬀering. And then once it's out there...
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Hard to take back.
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
You all know -- you know all too well. It's almost impossible to take back. And the
way in which you're explaining, why you want to take it back and then people start
assuming the worst. And it's a rationalization because it's underperforming. You want
people looking elsewhere, not the case. Unique users and page views are not ideal
ways of measuring engagement. They're not ideal ways of measuring the value that
a consumer website or application is generating because they can be gained. I don't
mean gained in nefarious ways. I mean, if you want to generate additional page
views, you can create a crappy experience. So they'll have to keep clicking. And the
whole shift from desktop to mobile also changes the way you think about this stuﬀ.
And unique users on a site like LinkedIn could be someone receiving an invitation,
clicking it, coming into the site and probably sticking out. No value created. So we
shifted. We pivoted. And we pivoted from unique users to sessions, people visiting
the site. You can't gain that. They're either coming to the site or they're not. And we
replaced the idea of unique users with engaged quality members. Those are people
who actually visited the site within the last 28 days, 30 or more connections. They're
reachable via e-mail address or a cell number. And they have at least 2 key ﬁelds
completed on their proﬁle. So massively up-leveling how we deﬁne a user of
LinkedIn. And we saw acceleration across the board. And yes?
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
The switch to sessions, did that happen once you're acquired by Microsoft? So does
that kind of somewhat liberating you're able to get away from the old metric and
then focus on what you thought matter the most?
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
Yes, more than somewhat liberating. It was quite liberating. It was actually a
discussion that has been underway at LinkedIn at least 2 or 3 quarters prior to the
announcement. That is something we want to do. And we're just trying to ﬁgure out
the right way to do it and the right time to do it and how we're going to explain to
folks, right? It's -- I think it's illustrative of one overarching factor in terms of the
success that we're seeing right now, which is being part of Microsoft and being able
to focus on some things that, if you're constantly trying to meet or beat quarterly
expectations, despite the best of your intentions and despite the fact that you are
trying to maximize long-term value, there's just the reality of managing to the
quarter. It's inescapable. And so this is an example. It may not be the most material
of examples. But where we could focus on what we believe to be best for the
business. And that has clearly been thematic throughout everything we do. The
member; value propositions and the way in which we're investing in our platforms;
our individual business lines, where we can think longer term. And interestinglyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-14

performance, we actually started to...
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Do better.
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
Outperform on a quarterly basis.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right. And so I think there would probably be some people where they'd be
surprised. So it seems like you've basically been able to run the business the way
you think is the best way to run the business. And if Microsoft hasn't -- interfere, isn't
the right word. But you've been able to have the strategy, be your strategy without
having it being dictated by Redmond. Is that fair?
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
Yes. And I -- it's funny. I wouldn't even couch it in terms of dictation or interference.
It's just not the ethos with which we established this relationship. I think Satya and his
leadership team, they have amazing talent at Microsoft. And there's a whole host of
areas where we collaborate. And we haven't gotten into some of the speciﬁc point of
integration in the present and in the future. But those are collaborative eﬀorts. They
are framed by a very, very clear mechanism for prioritization. I mentioned earlier, it
starts with growing LinkedIn. And accelerating the realization of our objectives. But
it's really 3 components. And they're interrelated. So the ﬁrst is to grow LinkedIn. The
second is to make our data accessible to Microsoft developers through APIs, SDKs,
in a way that's consistent. We're putting our members ﬁrst, consistent with our brand,
consistent with terms of service. And these are high hurdles to get over. And once
that data is made accessible, then hoping that Microsoft developers can then
leverage that data within Microsoft products to diﬀerentiate those products and
create more value for Microsoft's customers. And then success, you get a very nice
and virtuous cycle, where Microsoft developers then want to see LinkedIn grow. So
they're doing what they can to help LinkedIn accelerate its growth. So that we can
create more data that can be further leveraged by Microsoft to create more value for
Microsoft customers.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Flywheel keeps going.
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
And round and round it goes.

{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
Got to put my water down.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
(inaudible) put it down, sorry.
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
No. I mean, for the most part, my role is identical to the role I had previously. There's
a few notable changes. For one, this is the ﬁrst time I've gotten up on stage in an
event like this since we announced. No longer a publicly traded company, part of a
publicly traded company. And so the cycles that were going into that exclusively
have been reinvested in the integration. They have been reinvested in learning more
about Microsoft. And they've been reinvested in growing LinkedIn's business. So
that's been one material diﬀerence. The other is being a part of Microsoft and having
a seat at the table with Satya and the leadership team of Microsoft to better
understand what they're trying, how they're trying to accomplish it. And what role
LinkedIn can play in making a diﬀerence there.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
You talked about those 3 areas of focus, kind of growing LinkedIn, making the data
accessible and then making it so that the Microsoft developers can kind of leverage
the data that you're creating. How do you see that translating into the type of
products that you're oﬀering or kind of synergies that you have between Microsoft
products and LinkedIn products?
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
Yes. Well some very speciﬁc real-world examples?
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
Most recently, we just announced within the last week taking a product that we had
been testing and had a limited audience and growing it out far more broadly is
LinkedIn integration in Microsoft Word to help people ﬂesh out and develop their
resumes. And to do it, leveraging LinkedIn proﬁle information. So as you -- there's a
ton of people that use Microsoft Word to create resumes. And once we understand
that you're in the process of developing your resume or editing your resume, we can
light up a right rail, a panel on the right side of the stage. And in there, based on the
words that you're using in your resume, we know, for example, what kind of title
you're seeking, what kind of title you have. And oftentimes, with regard to writing
your resume, it's a cold start. You don't know what to say. You don't know how to say
it. I remember when I was in college, I used to look at the resumes of the folks thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 14Q - Heather Anne Bellini
A - Jeﬀrey Weinerwere older than me and better understand how to do that stuﬀ. And LinkedIn has all
of that information and data.
So -- and then leveraging some light AI, we can make some recommendations and
some suggestions. We can ultimately help you with formatting. We can connect you
to people who can provide coaching. But the most important thing we can do is
right there in the right rail let's light up some relevant jobs, right? You're updating
your resume extensively for reason. And we know what job you're seeking. We know
your objectives are. We know the skills you have. We know the people that you
know. We're in a pretty good position to help you ﬁnd a good job. So that would be
an example. We have been, ever since the deal closed, our very ﬁrst point of
integration was our Sales Navigator product and integrating that into Dynamics
CRM. And since that time, Microsoft has taken a new SKU to market in terms of
Microsoft Relationship Sales solution. And that's starting to generate some nice
pipeline momentum, still early days. One of the things we're most excited about is
Outlook integration. So if you're in Outlook, you'll receive an e-mail. It may be
someone legitimate.
And you know you're supposed to respond to them and you try to ﬁgure out how
best to respond to them. But you don't know them very well. You just put the mouse,
just brieﬂy over the name. And you get a mini LinkedIn Proﬁle Card and you start to
see who this person is, what they do, where they work, who you know in common.
Then if you click on that further, you get more in-depth LinkedIn experience right
there within Outlook. So can see the kind of information they're sharing, the contents
of work and so on. You can also integrate it with Microsoft. You can begin to see
things like org chart. You can see through LinkedIn their skill set. And ultimately, you
can see which roles in which -- if they're colleagues within your company, what roles
they might be best at. You can ﬁgure out who to reach out to, to help answer
questions.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Do these become all new SKUs of, say, Oﬃce or Outlook or with Dynamics? Or how
do you think about packaging these up?
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
So the Sales Navigator integration with Dynamics CRM is a SKU. The Outlook
integration is just layering more value into Outlook. And ultimately all of that's
identity information. All this kind of this social fabric that we have on LinkedIn with
any professional contacts. There's a lot of opportunity to layer that throughout Oﬃce,
not just in Outlook. So anytime you're working with anyone with a better sense of
who they are, what they know, who they know, these are things that make a
meaningful diﬀerence to how work gets done. And it's with your existing colleagues
within your company and it's with people outside of your company you're trying to
learn more about. Think about a meeting you're preparing for, whether they're sales
prospects or business development partnership or a new clientele. Think about
walking into that meeting with a far greater understanding of exactly who everyone
is, what you know in common, what you have in common. It just changes the nature
of that meeting.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-14

Right. I'm going to pause for a second and see if there's any questions in the
audience before I keep going. I think there's -- there are mic runners. Right here, up
front. Bear with me one second.
Jeﬀ, one of the things you said in the past was as a sort of not mega-scale tech
company, it was hard when you looked at what the future held in terms of core
technology to envision the path forward with -- in engineering. So I'd love to hear
little bit now that you've had a year and change of being part of Microsoft. Like, what
does that core technology mean to LinkedIn? And what can you do with it?
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
Yes. So a few things that come to mind immediately, AI, unsurprisingly. And while we
had made sizable investment in Machine Learning over the years, it's hard to
compete exactly to your point, with the tech titans investment in AI. And there's a lot
of expertise there that we're increasingly going to be able to leverage. There's
elements of Azure, for example, that we can leverage. That's going to meaningfully
accelerate how we scale our video -- posting video on LinkedIn and those
opportunities. We're doing machine translation within our feeds, leveraging Azure
capabilities. There's a fair number of areas that we are meaningfully able to
accelerate by virtue of the investment that Microsoft has made thus far to date.
Interestingly enough. And it's hard to tease apart the extent to which it would have
happened anyway or to the extent it's part of being a part of Microsoft. But we're
seeing the highest rate of engineering hiring in terms of wins and yield on oﬀers in
absolute terms in the company's history and LinkedIn's history. So that's been a
really positive trend as well. And I think part of that has to do with what we're trying
to accomplish and how we're trying to accomplish that. I think part of it is people like
the fact that LinkedIn is now playing in this much bigger sandbox as far as advanced
technologies and has access to world-class talent and infrastructure. So --
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Any other questions from the audience? It's hard to see with the lights. So there's
one right behind you, sir.
Jeﬀ, quick question on competition. Who's LinkedIn competition?
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
So as far as professional networks go, speciﬁcally, there's really one professional
network, one country in the world where we're not the #1 professional network, that's
Germany. And there's a company called XING there that's been doing well.
Thankfully, we're growing in Germany pretty quickly, which we're excited about.
International has actually been a big part of the acceleration that we're seeing. Our
membership, 70% international at this point. And we're seeing business lineFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-14

A - Jeﬀrey Weineracceleration in a meaningful way in a number of diﬀerent markets for Talent
Solutions. EMEA has been a very positive surprise. The team has done a really nice
job there. France is one of our fastest-growing markets in the world, which was
unexpected, not only in terms of engagement. But also the business and starting to
add up. Germany, where we were lagging XING I think closing that gap. And we're
starting to see the impact on the business and that's a big opportunity going
forward. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the size of the markets and the fact they're still
developing, China and India, are large growth opportunities for us. And we continue
to see some pretty positive momentum in markets like that as well.
Question...
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Sorry, go ahead.
Jeﬀ, question is just broadly, if you can help us connect the dots between all the
diﬀerent communication platforms inside Microsoft between Skype, Xbox, Minecraft.
Is there a master plan? I mean, obviously, you've got Outlook that's massive. Help us
connect all of those diﬀerent pieces.
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
I would gladly leave that to Satya and the team responsible for the communication
strategy. I do think they're very clearly in the long-term plans to maximize alignment
and start to orient those oﬀerings around value propositions and around the end
user as opposed to just selling product and bringing more SKUs to market. And I
think Satya and the team has been very thoughtful in terms of areas for opportunity
that will help align situations with multiple SKUs like that.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. Any other -- sorry, there's one right here.
Jeﬀ, you've talked a lot about the product innovation on the user side and how you
can leverage diﬀerent technologies to help the users to be more successful in
whatever it is that they're trying to do. Can you talk a little bit about some of the
innovation that you're driving on the Talent Solutions side to help the users of that
product to be more successful?
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
Yes. So thank you. It's a really important question. So Talent Solutions is still our
largest business, especially when you consider our learning solutions business post
the acquisition of Lynda. Increasingly we think about those 2 as one solution set. And
where we're taking Talent Solutions has 2 components really, a marketplace, you'veFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-14

Page 12 of 14got people seeking the jobs and you've got people oﬀering the jobs. In terms of the
job-seeking experience, we have dramatically increased the number of jobs made
available on LinkedIn. About 4-plus years ago, we were at roughly 350,000 jobs
available on LinkedIn. And we thought that was the immediate addressable
opportunity for our core audience in terms of high-value white-collar jobs and
knowledge worker roles.
Today, we're about to surpass 15 million jobs on LinkedIn, something we're pretty
excited about and is making a pretty signiﬁcant diﬀerence, that kind of liquidity and
the comprehensiveness for our active job seekers. So it starts on that foundation. But
just investing more in getting that value proposition right. We now have our jobs
capability directly and seamlessly integrated into our ﬂagship application. And that
was a huge step function lift in terms of the number of unique users seeking jobs, in
terms of job applied, in terms ultimately of conﬁrmed hires, which is True North [ph].
And we can see that by virtue of when someone changes their proﬁle.
The other side of that equation with regard to Talent Solutions, the innovation that's
happening both in terms of products and go-to-market. With regard to products, we
announced at Talent Connect, which is our largest customer event on an annual
basis last October, that we are going to be going all in on talent intelligence and
starting to oﬀer data-driven products that help our customers to better informed --
more informed workforce planning, which is increasingly going to become essential
to the success of these companies, given not only the intensifying battle for talent.
But some of the trends we're seeing on a global basis in terms of automation and AI,
skills gap, the rise of independent workers, et cetera. So we're very excited about
that. Also, we've started to evolve our go-to-market strategy and business model.
And within Talent Solutions, in particular, we're starting to gain some traction with
what we call the Talent Solutions enterprise program, which has revisited our
business model and has broadened the potential addressable opportunity within the
customers we already served, who may have said that they didn't necessarily have
the budget to reach their entire force of recruiters and sourcers and hiring managers
that they were purchasing products pretty high-ticket item for the people who use us
most intensively. What we knew that everyone within the organization who is related
to that process could beneﬁt through the tool. And so we went back to the drawing
board and thought through that business model and are now able to eﬀectively
reduce the cost per seat or cost per user, while materially expanding the footprint
within the organization. And the net result is more budget being allocated to
LinkedIn. And so that's Talent Solutions proper.
With regard to learning, the enterprise component of learning when we acquired
Lynda. Lynda was very early on with regard to taking other product to the enterprise.
It was largely a consumer oﬀerings and consumer subscription. We were able to
leverage our existing enterprise sales force. And we're starting to see meaningful
traction with regard to the enterprise. And we think this is a pretty big opportunity
for all the reasons I cited earlier in terms of both secular trends and the need
increasingly for companies to not only source the best talent. But to develop theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-14

going forward. So it's kind of 3 legs to a stool.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
You mentioned enterprise sales force that you have that's existing at LinkedIn. But
also Microsoft has obviously a huge global enterprise sales force with deep
relationships. Can you share with us kind of how you might be able to leverage the
broader footprint of the Microsoft sales organization?
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
Sure. One example would be the Sales Nav Dynamics CRM example, where we're
able to leverage Microsoft's sales teams' footprints in terms of the customers that are
using Dynamics. And conversely, leverage our footprint for Sales Navigator.
Microsoft, the sales team, has very signiﬁcant penetration on a global basis that
we're potentially able to leverage. We recently announced our hiring a country
manager in Japan, which we're excited about. That's a large unaddressed
opportunity by LinkedIn, where Microsoft has an enormous presence. And I think
Microsoft's business in Japan is probably larger than or at parity with our entire
business. And we're able to leverage their footprint in areas like that. Microsoft has a
very strong footprint in terms of governments as customers that use Microsoft
products. And increasingly, we've got some case studies where governments are
purchasing our learning products to oﬀer to their citizens. And that started in schools
and higher educational organizations. And it is now expanding to everyone within
that jurisdiction.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Is it fair to say that, that is just -- you're just exploring that now. So the opportunity is -
- you've been able to accelerate revenues just with what you've been doing with
your internal LinkedIn asset. The kind of extension of the relationship into the rest of
the Microsoft family seems like that's yet necessarily to show up in the top line. Is that
fair?
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
I think that's the -- an accurate characterization. I think there's a fair amount of
opportunity there. And I just cited a few that would leverage Microsoft's ﬁeld sales
footprint. But there's also their customer footprint in terms of subscriptions and in
terms of product lines O365 and M365 and then our subscription product, which is
one of our larger businesses. And you start to think about what's possible in terms of
integration opportunities, in terms of leveraging those existing footprints, whether
it's learning, whether it's our general subscription packages. And that's also an
interesting area to further explore.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
All right. That's great. I think we're about out of time. But thanks, everybody. Thank
you, Jeﬀ. It's great.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-14
