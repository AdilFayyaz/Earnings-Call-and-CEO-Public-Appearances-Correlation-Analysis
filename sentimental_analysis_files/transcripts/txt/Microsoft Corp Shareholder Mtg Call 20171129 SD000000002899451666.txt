Presentation
Today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are predictions,
projections or other statements about future events based on current expectations
and assumptions. Actual results may diﬀer materially from these forward-looking
statements because of a variety of risks and uncertainties about our business, which
are discussed today or described in our ﬁlings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, including our Form 10-K and 10-Q. We do not undertake any duty to
update any forward-looking statement.
Please welcome to the stage, Microsoft Chairman, John Thompson.
{BIO 15832126 <GO>}
Good morning. Welcome. I'm John Thompson, Chairman of the Board at Microsoft.
For those of you who are here with us at the Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue as well
as those of you listening to our online website, we welcome you to our Annual
Shareholder Meeting. We're streaming live from our Investor Relations website. We
strive to make the meeting as inclusive as possible. We're also excited to oﬀer
shareholders the opportunity to participate and vote via the virtual shareholder
meeting. Our board values your feedback. The thoughtfully expressed and diverse
opinions you provide help us create real value for you, our shareholders.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 2 of 28I'd like to share with you the presenters for today's meeting. I will be joined on stage
by Satya Nadella, our Chief Executive Oﬃcer; Amy Hood, our Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Oﬃcer; Brad Smith, our President and Chief Legal
Oﬃcer; and John Seethoﬀ, our Deputy Secretary -- I'm sorry, Deputy General
Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
John will address the business portion of the meeting, followed by Amy, who will
review Microsoft's ﬁnancial results. Brad will share the plan for the Redmond campus
redevelopment and our commitment to this region. And ﬁnally, Satya will talk about
our expansive opportunity and how Microsoft is uniquely positioned to lead our
customers across every industry digital transformation. Following his remarks, we'll
then show you some exciting innovations that are all happening all around Microsoft.
Then we'll have an opportunity for Q&A. But ﬁrst, let's attend to a few formalities.
Broadview Financial has been appointed the inspector of elections for this meeting.
The inspectors are located in the reception table in the lobby. Most of you have
already voted your proxy, or your proxy votes have already been tallied. If you're a
shareholder of record or a beneﬁcial shareholder holding a legal proxy from your
bank or broker. And you want to vote your shares now or change your vote, ballots
are available from the inspectors at the reception table in the lobby. Following a
ballot -- ﬁlling a ballot, I'm sorry. And giving it to the inspectors will revoke any earlier
proxy you gave. If you are a beneﬁcial shareholder with a voting instruction form, you
also may submit those forms and use the computers in the reception table to cast a
new vote. The votes are now open and will close in a few minutes. And the
presentation of our business matters will be here.
As Satya said in his letter to you, we are proud of the progress we've made this past
year. And we're eager, very eager, about the opportunities ahead. We continue to be
guided by our mission to empower every person and every organization on the
planet to achieve more. Microsoft's strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and
productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge, all infused with
AI. We believe achieving our mission extends beyond providing our customers with
products and services, to helping address economic, social and environmental
issues around the world. Microsoft's approach in important areas like energy usage,
data privacy and diversity inclusion is always grounded in its mission and values.
We also have a long-standing commitment to pursue governance in a way that is
thoughtful, proactive and constructive. We regularly evaluate governance
frameworks to ensure our policies meet the needs of our company and the
expectations of you, our shareholders. Eﬀective this past July, we adopted a new
board policy that targets an average tenure of 10 years or less for the board's
independent directors. This approach strikes a balance between retaining directors
with deep knowledge about our company and adding new directors who bring
fresh, important perspective.
In the past year, we reﬁned our executive compensation plan to align performance-
based pay with strategic opportunities, business results and shareholder returns. We
adopted preestablished ﬁnancial metrics that determine 50% of the annual cashFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 28incentive for all executive oﬃcers. We aligned the metrics of our performance stock
awards with our 3 strategic ambitions. And we reduced the maximum award levels
for performance stock awards.
As part of our ongoing commitment to create a balanced board with diverse
viewpoints and deep industry experience, we regularly add new directors. Though
we still have more work to do, our board nominees continue to be more diverse than
ever. Seven of 14 nominees are either female, nationally or ethnically diverse.
Now I'd like to introduce the nominees for the Board of Directors who are here with
us today: William H. Gates III, our cofounder; Reid Hoﬀman is a member of our
Regulatory and Public Policy Committee; Hugh Johnston is a member of our Audit
Committee; Teri List-Stoll is a member of our Audit Committee and the Governance
and Nominating Committee; Chuck Noski is chair of our Audit Committee and a
member of the Governance and Nominating Committee; Dr. Helmut Panke, chair of
our Regulatory and Public Policy Committee and a member of the Audit Committee;
Sandi Peterson is a member of the Compensation Committee and the Regulatory
and Public Policy Committee; Charlie Scharf is a member of the Compensation
Committee and Governance and Nominating Committee; John Stanton, chair of our
Compensation Committee and a member of the Regulatory and Public Policy
Committee; and Padma Warrior is a member of the Compensation Committee.
And we have 2 new nominees, Penny Pritzker and Arne Sorenson. Following the
election this morning, the board will consider the committee appointments for Penny
and Arne. And also consider other adjustments in committee assignments for the
next year.
And lastly, Mason Morﬁt is not seeking reelection. I personally want to thank Mason,
as does the full board, for the many contributions that he's made over the course of
his tenure here.
Also here with us today is Steve Sinwell, Chris Weber. And James LaCamp
representing Deloitte & Touche, our independent auditors.
And now I'd like to call the 2017 Annual Shareholder Meeting to order. I'll be serving
as the chair of the meeting. And John Seethoﬀ will be serving as the secretary. This
will be John's last meeting serving in this capacity as he will retire later this year after
17 years with Microsoft. As with all people like John, I can't tell you how impressive he
is and how important he has been to this company and to this board. We would like
to thank him for his leadership and his guidance.
As chair of the meeting, I've adopted an agenda that will govern the order of
business and the rules of conduct for the meeting. Copies of the agenda and the
rules are available at the reception table outside the meeting room. The rules of
conduct also govern the Q&A session.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

present the matters to be voted on. John?
{BIO 4224917 <GO>}
Thank you, John, for those kind words. Welcome, everyone. This morning, I'll walk us
through the short formal meeting. Then as John said, you'll hear from Amy, Brad and
Satya, followed by a Q&A session. The notice of the meeting and Internet availability
of the proxy materials were mailed by Broadridge Corporation beginning October
16, 2017. And it went to all shareholders of record as of September 29, 2017. As a
result, the meeting is being held pursuant to proper notice. Proxies representing
more than 88% of the roughly 7.7 billion shares of the company's stock that are
eligible to vote have been received. This means we have a quorum present and the
meeting is duly constituted and will proceed.
This morning, we have 6 management proposals for you to consider. They were all
described in the proxy statement for today's meeting.
The ﬁrst item is the election of directors. The following 14 people have been properly
nominated by the board: William H. Gates III; Reid Hoﬀman; Hugh Johnston; Teri
List-Stoll; Satya Nadella; Charles Noski; Dr. Helmut Panke; Sandra Peterson; Penny
Pritzker; Charles Scharf; Arne Sorenson; John Stanton; John Thompson; and Padma
Warrior. The board recommends a vote for each of them.
The second item is an advisory vote to approve executive compensation as
disclosed in the company's proxy statement. The board recommends a vote for this
proposal.
The third item is an advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on
executive compensation. The board recommends a vote for every year.
As the fourth item, we ask that you ratify selection of the company's independent
auditor, Deloitte & Touche, for ﬁscal year 2018. The board recommends a vote for the
proposal.
The ﬁfth item is approval of the material terms of the performance goals under the
Microsoft Corporation executive incentive plan. The board recommends approval of
the proposal.
Last, the sixth item is approval of the Microsoft Corporation 2017 stock plan. The
board recommends approval of that proposal as well.
The discussion of matters for shareholder consideration is now closed. And the polls
are also now closed. So now, I'll share with you the preliminary voting tabulation.
First, the 14 nominees on the ballot to become a director are elected with over 98%
of votes cast. They'll serve until the Annual Shareholder Meeting and until theirFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

Proposal 2, the advisory vote on executive compensation, has been approved by
more than 95% of votes cast.
Proposal 3, the advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive
compensation, has been approved for a vote every year by more than 90% of votes
cast.
Proposal 4, ratiﬁcation of the company's auditor, Deloitte & Touche, has been
approved by over 98% of votes cast.
Proposal 5, the approval of material terms of the performance goals under the
Microsoft Corporation executive incentive plan, has been approved by more than
98% of the votes cast.
Finally, proposal 6, the approval of the Microsoft Corporation 2017 stock plan, has
been approved by over 96% of votes cast.
We expect to post the details of the ﬁnal voting results on all these matters on our
Investor Relations website later today. We'll also report the results including the
company's decision on the frequency of future say-on-pay votes in a Form 8-K that
will be ﬁled with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 4 business days.
With that, we completed the formal portion of the meeting. And the meeting is now
adjourned. So let me hand the stage over to our Chief Financial Oﬃcer, Amy Hood.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thanks, John. Hello, everyone. And thank you for being here or watching online
today. I'm proud of our performance and achievement in FY '17. We executed well
and ﬁnished the year with $90 billion in revenue, with 11% operating income growth
and 29% EPS growth. Strategic areas like Commercial Cloud and gaming continued
to have strong momentum. And we welcomed LinkedIn to Microsoft, bringing
together the world's leading professional network and the world's leading
professional cloud to create unique scenarios that open new addressable market
opportunities and enrich productivity experiences of our customers.
And in May, at our Financial Analyst Brieﬁng, we shared our view on the key
initiatives to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. To meet the evolving
needs of our customers and partners, we've aligned our sales and go-to-market
approach to 5 core customer solution areas: modern workplace, business
applications, applications and infrastructure, data and AI. And gaming.
We completed 8 acquisitions to enhance our capabilities and talent in strategic
growth areas. For example, we purchased Mixer, a gameplay streaming company, to
broaden our engagement with the Xbox community. And we added Maluuba, aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 28company that built machine learning and inference engine that reads and
comprehends text, to help us advance our AI strategy and make it accessible and
valuable to everyone.
We continue to invest in innovation and expand our market opportunities, while
maintaining our commitment to shareholder return, which included a total cash
return of $22.3 billion. And in September, we announced an 8% increase in our
quarterly dividend. We completed our prior $40 billion buyback authorization in
December 2016. And are now executing against the current $40 billion buyback
authorization.
Now I'll share a few highlights from the past ﬁscal year. First, our Commercial Cloud,
which is comprised of Oﬃce 365, Azure and Dynamics 365 as well as other cloud
properties. We ended ﬁscal '17 with more than $18.9 billion in Commercial Cloud
annualized revenue run rate and nearly $15 billion in revenue. Commercial Cloud
results were driven by strong growth rates in each of the services. Oﬃce 365 grew
46%, Azure grew 99% and Dynamics 365 grew 78%.
We also made a commitment to material gross margin improvement. And we
ﬁnished the year at 50% gross margin, substantial progress from our prior year and a
reﬂection of great work by our engineering, marketing and sales teams in this critical
business.
On the consumer side, our Oﬃce 365 consumer subscriber base grew to 27 million
as more users chose our cloud-enabled productivity solutions.
I want to brieﬂy talk about our server and Azure businesses. Collectively, we look at
these 2 businesses as our hybrid cloud, which enables customers to run their own
data centers with our public cloud in a single cohesive infrastructure and at scale.
Our true hybrid cloud approach is a key diﬀerentiator and competitive advantage in
the market. And in ﬁscal '17, we grew that multibillion-dollar business by 13% year-on-
year.
Now let's turn to progress across our broad Windows ecosystem. We continue to see
healthy, commercial and consumer demand for Windows 10, increasing our base of
active Windows 10 devices. And in turn, contributed growth in usage-driven services
like search or gaming. Search continued its revenue growth and proﬁtability. And our
gaming business exceeded $9 billion in revenue, with 53 million Xbox LIVE monthly
users. In our devices business, we expanded the Surface family, introducing Surface
Studio, Surface Laptop and the newest Surface Pro, ending the year with more than
$4 billion in revenue.
Now just a few comments on our current ﬁscal year. We adopted revenue standard
606, an accounting standard that allows us to simplify the communication of our
results by eliminating non-GAAP revenue reporting. As we do at the start of each
ﬁscal year, we also updated our investor metrics. Given the size of our Commercial
Cloud business, we now provide both the Commercial Cloud revenue as well asFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 28Bradford L. Smithgross margin percentage as quarterly metrics. And we had a strong start to the ﬁscal
year with double-digit top and bottom line growth in Q1, a result of our consistent
execution and ongoing investment in product innovation and sales capacity. We
surpassed our goal of $20 billion in Commercial Cloud annualized revenue run rate
set a little over two years ago. And we're ahead of our original ﬁnancial commitment
for LinkedIn, which we expect to be accretive to EPS this ﬁscal year, excluding the
impact of amortization from purchase accounting.
We are conﬁdent that our innovation road map, our disciplined investment approach
and world-class talent position us for continued growth. And we believe that the
highest shareholder value is created by investing in our future and creating
diﬀerentiated scenarios and solutions for every organization and person to achieve
more.
And with that, please join me in welcoming our President and Chief Legal Oﬃcer,
Brad Smith.
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Thanks, Amy. Well. Good morning. It's my pleasure this morning to share with all of
you the next steps, the next chapter for Microsoft, our campus and for Redmond,
Washington. Because as you may have seen in the news this morning, we
announced earlier today our plans for all of this.
Well the interesting thing is that Redmond has been changing periodically for a
century. Back in the 1920s, the land where Microsoft sits today was owned by a
gentleman named Silvio Morelli. And he used the land as a chicken farm. Well he
was fortunate. His business prospered. He grew. He invested in the land. And it
eventually became what was known as Silvio Morelli's Chicken Ranch. In the 1960s, it
was sold. It was anticipated that the land would become in fact a shopping mall,
something that never happened. But eventually, it was purchased in the 1980s. It was
sold to Microsoft to become our new home. The ground was broken in 1985. And in
1986, a new campus was born.
Here you see Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer and Jon Shirley. The so-called iconic X wings
were created buildings 1 through 4, surrounding what has forever since been known
as Lake Bill. A new tradition was born. When a development team would ﬁnish its
product, it would release it to manufacturing. And everyone would promptly run to
the lake, where the leader of the team would be thrown in the water.
Well now, it's time for a new generation for Microsoft and for our campus. We have a
new generation of employees. They're building the tools and services that are really
redeﬁning the future work space for our customers, not just here in Washington
state. But around the world. So it's only ﬁtting, in fact it's even essential, that this new
generation of employees have the new generation of workspace where they too can
do their best work. So let me share with you the vision of what's coming to
Redmond.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 28Clearly, this is no longer a chicken farm. We're excited about what's coming ahead.
Well it'd be taking down those ﬁrst 4 buildings as well as 8 others. And as those 12
buildings come down, 18 new buildings will go up in their place. Those 18 buildings
will have 2.5 million square feet. In addition, we'll be renovating 6.7 million other
square feet. Put all together, we'll have the equivalent of 180 football ﬁelds of the
most modern workspace for people in our industry. We'll have 2,500 employees
working in the construction and development space over the next ﬁve years. And
when they're done, we think that we're going to have a place that will enable the
employees of Microsoft to create, to connect, to collaborate and most importantly to
innovate, to do their best work to create great products for our customers.
The space will be more open than what they have today. It'll be less formal. There
will be team neighborhoods. There will be natural light. It's exactly the kind of
environment that we have found in our most recent buildings here and around the
world do the best to help our employees do the work that they need to do.
It also is going to take advantage of other things. It will connect with the light rail
station that will open in 2023. And in no small measure, our ability to take this kind of
step is really enhanced by the long-term investments that this community and this
region have made. It has really required a long-term partnership, not just by
companies like Microsoft. But with the state of Washington, with King County, with
the city of Redmond and other cities in the region. And sometimes, by voters
including many of you in this room, the votes that made it possible to replace and
expand the 520 Bridge, the vote that will make it possible to bring light rail literally
to our doorstep in 2023.
And when people decide to where -- about where they want to work, our employees
will know they can live in the middle of Bellevue and take the train and be at our
campus in 10 minutes. If they want to live in the middle of Seattle, they can take the
train and be on our campus in 0.5 hour. And when they get oﬀ the train, they'll ﬁnd
that they can go [ph] one direction and walk over a new pedestrian bridge to
buildings that exist today. They can get on their bicycle. They can go the other
direction and they'll ﬁnd themselves in the heart of this new part of the campus.
They'll walk past restaurants and retail space. They'll ﬁnd this plaza of 2 acres that has
room for up to 12,000 people. So you can imagine employee meetings in the
summer, customer events and the like.
We're also doing what we've always done, which is taking advantage of the
outdoors. As you saw in the video, this will continue to be a campus that oﬀers great
opportunities for people, not just who work at Microsoft. But for our neighbors as
well. People who want to walk, who want a bicycle, there'll be ﬁelds for people to
play baseball and soccer and even cricket. It really is something that we've tried to
focus on with the neighborhood in mind. That's why we're proud that we'll be
making $150 million in investments from Microsoft to invest in this neighborhood
with that pedestrian bridge, with better roadways, with the new storm water system
and with the new Redmond Technology Center Station, where these trains will arrive.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 28Satya NadellaIt's also a development that we're focusing on with the environment in mind as well.
In recent years, we've taken steps to build a smart campus, focused on reducing
energy, waste and our use of carbon. We're using Azure for all of the monitoring of
our HVAC systems. We're bringing down our electric -- electricity consumption.
We've become a 0 waste campus. We've been certiﬁed and will retain that
certiﬁcation as this moves forward.
And we're committed to taking the kinds of steps that will broadly reduce the use of
carbon. That's why we'll continue to provide fun transit options for all of our
employees, like the ORCA transit card or their use of cars and van pools or the
Microsoft connector service.
We also believe that this is a smart investment for all of you, for our shareholders.
Instead of using our space as we do today to park cars above ground, as you'll see,
we'll park cars underground. We'll create a more urban feel where people work in
the buildings. But have just as much green space as we've had before.
And even as we have our eye on the future, we're going to continue to nurture the
legacies that matter to everybody. Lake Bill will survive.
Ultimately, we're excited about what this enables us to do here in Puget Sound.
When you think about it, Microsoft has an asset that's not only unusual, it's maybe
even unique. We have a campus of 500 acres. It's 500 acres that neighbors a vibrant
urban core, healthy suburban cities, mountains, lakes and literally miles of forest. I
think one would be hard pressed to ﬁnd any company anywhere in the world that
can look to an asset that can match this. We think it's one of the crowned jewels for
Microsoft. We think it's one of the crowned jewels for Puget Sound. And with this
kind of investment and this kind of work, we are excited about bringing this into the
future and contributing even more, both here at home and around the world. Thank
you very much.
So now, please join me in giving a warm welcome to our CEO, Satya Nadella.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thank you, Brad. Thank you for being here today as well as all of you joining online.
We greatly appreciate your commitment as shareholders to Microsoft.
I'm proud of the progress we have made this year at Microsoft. And more
importantly, with our customers and partners. We are eager to make even more
progress in the years to come. We are always guided by our mission to empower
every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our mission
provides us an unprecedented opportunity as digital technology is transforming
every industry and every walk of life. It enables us to create local opportunity, growth
and impact in every community and country around the world that we operate in
and serve.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 28As Amy shared, we have seen tremendous cloud growth, innovation in AI and digital
transformation progress with customers. It's great to see increased usage and
engagement across all of the solution areas.
Let me share a few of the highlights. More than 120 million people use Oﬃce 365
Commercial today. More than 28 million consumers use Oﬃce Home and Personal.
More than 53 million members are active on Xbox LIVE, as we speak. More than 530
million members use LinkedIn. Dynamics 365 customer growth was 40% year-over-
year. And Azure compute usage grew or doubled year-over-year. And now, Windows
10 is active on more than 600 million devices around the world.
Everywhere I go, I see ﬁrsthand the impact we are having. Boeing is using Azure AI to
create a digital twin for every plane they build. Ford's designers are completely
redesigning how they think about the design process itself using HoloLens. State
Bank of India is using Oﬃce 365 to empower more than 200,000 of their
employees. In China, we integrated Oﬃce 365 with WeChat to empower the nearly 1
billion users to be more productive.
Celebrating our customers' success is what really drives us at Microsoft. With that as
a backdrop, I wanted to turn to the opportunity ahead. A new technology paradigm
is emerging, one with an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge. Microsoft is
uniquely positioned to lead in this new technology era. There are 3 characteristics
that deﬁne this shift. First at the experience layer is becoming more multidevice and
multisense. That means a person's experience with technology will span a multitude
of devices and become more natural with voice, ink, gaze, gesture-based
interactions. Second, artiﬁcial intelligence will be pervasive across all of the apps, all
of the devices as well as all of the infrastructure to help drive the next level of
insights and action. Third, computing will be even more distributed than ever before.
Compute power at the edge, whether it's a connected car, a connected factory ﬂoor
or a connected device.
With this new paradigm comes a complete new opportunity for us. Every customer I
talk to is looking for both innovative technology to drive their growth. But also a
strategic partner that they can rely on to help them build their own digital capability.
Microsoft is that partner. We are focused on bringing our technology and products
together into experiences and solution that deliver new value to our customers.
Let me brieﬂy discuss these solution areas. I'll start with what we describe as the
modern workplace. The workplace itself is transforming very rapidly. The
expectations of the employees are changing. There's a very diverse set of skills that
are coming together across globally distributed teams. We want to empower
everyone to participate in this new culture of work, enterprises, small; and medium-
sized businesses, students and teachers, more than 2 billion ﬁrst-line workers from
health care professionals to barristers. Microsoft 365 brings together Windows 10,
Oﬃce 365 and Enterprise Mobility and Security into one complete integrated
solution for organizations of all sizes. It's a people-centered approach spanning all
devices to unlock the creativity, inspire teamwork while simplifying security and
management. We've infused AI deeply across Microsoft 365. And you'll see manyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 28examples of this in the demos. PowerPoint automatically transcribes and translates
presentations. The Word Editor suggest bias-free language. OneNote Math Assistant
converts handwritten equations into digital form. Microsoft Teams, for example, takes
collaboration to a completely new level, bringing people, conversations and content
together into a digital hub. Windows 10 Fall Creators Update unlocks the creator in
all of us with new interfaces in Cortana, inking immersive 3D content creation and
mixed reality experiences. And we're making Windows 10 more accessible with new
features like the eye control, which gives people the ability to operate a PC just using
their eyes. You'll see our great holiday lineup of Windows 10 devices from the new
Surface Laptop to devices from our OEM partners.
Now let me talk about our unique approach to the next solution area, business
applications. Every process inside a business is increasingly being digitized. Today,
much of the value still, when it comes to sales or ﬁnance or operations or HR, is
locked up in data silos. We have a unique opportunity to help our customers
connect these valuable assets and transform their businesses. The combination of
LinkedIn and Dynamics 365 enables us to build a much more modern, modular
business application suite with AI that is deeply infused for organizations of all sizes.
Now I'll turn to the last 2 solution areas, the hybrid cloud value and -- which is --
comes across applications and infrastructure as well as data and AI. We've been
focused on addressing the real-world needs of our customers ever since the
beginning of our infrastructure eﬀorts. Customers with our diﬀerentiated approach
to cloud architecting for hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities
and trusted security and compliance. From Costco to Bank of America, our hybrid
cloud approach is one reason nearly every Fortune 500 company has chosen to
partner with Microsoft. Azure Stack and Azure provides this hybrid consistency that
every organization needs both at the edge and in the cloud. With our Azure AI and
data platforms, we are democratizing AI, enabling organizations to get more out of
their own data assets and giving them powerful building blocks to create their own
AI capability. From machine learning to vision to speech to text understanding,
translation, emotion detection and many more capabilities, we want to give them
that capability to create their own intelligence.
Finally, we continue to invest in making Azure the most trusted cloud with AI-based
security. Our data center expansion brings Azure to 42 regions globally, more than
any other cloud provider and with the most comprehensive compliance coverage in
the industry.
And now I'll go to the last solution area, gaming. We're mobilizing to pursue our
expansive opportunity in 100-plus billion gaming market. This means broadening
our approach to how we think about gaming end to end, about starting with games
and how they are created and distributed and to how they are played and viewed.
We will continue to connect our gaming assets across the PC, the console and
mobile. We will also work to grow and engage our more than 53 million Xbox LIVE
members more deeply and frequently with new services like the Game Pass and
Mixer. And our new Xbox One X, the most technically advanced and most powerful
console ever built, is seeing incredible response from fans this holiday season.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

that enable others to grow and thrive now and well into the future.
Now I would love to welcome the Microsoft team on stage to give you a great demo
of all of the new innovations over the last 12 months, especially from a consumer and
an end-user point of view. So let's just welcome the Microsoft team up on stage.
Thank you.
Last year, we showed you some of the amazing new editions to the Surface family of
devices and how we're enabling everyone to be more creative using Microsoft
technology. This year, we wanted to do something just a little bit diﬀerent. We want
to show you how we're inspiring and empowering the creator in all of us with the
new Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, how we're extending experiences beyond
mobile devices and PCs, how businesses are transforming the way they work with
mixed reality. And how we're are building the modern workplace with the help of
Microsoft 365 and artiﬁcial intelligence. So Molly and I are going to dive right in.
Thank you, Shun. Creating and editing videos just got easier with the Windows 10
Fall Creators Update, no editing experience required. With our totally reimagined
photos app, we're making it easy for you to personalize and share your story like
never before, using your own photos, videos, inking and even 3D eﬀects. With the
new photos app, I can edit my own photos and videos into one video with a
soundtrack, theme, ink and polish transitions. And with 3D eﬀects, I can add glowing
sparkles, autumn leaves or snow, like I did here to enhance my video.
Now extending 3D even further, I'd like to show you how I can bring fall right here
into this room. I begin by visiting Remix 3D, our online 3D community. And I'm going
to start by searching for a fall tree. Here's one. Shun, could I have you step over here,
please?
Absolutely.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

simply by clicking view and mixed reality. And with mixed reality viewer, I'm going to
be able to place it right here on stage with Shun. All right. So we've got our tree. I'm
going to set it right over here on the corner of this stage and what's really cool is I'm
able to move the tree around on the stage. I can scale it to make it bigger. I can
rotate it around to get it just the way that I want. And my favorite part, I can snap a
photo of Shun with the tree to save it and share with her later. Thank you.
Now for the ﬁrst time, Windows connects with your iPhone or Android phone to
deliver a seamless experience across devices. With continue on your PC, I can start
reading a long news article on my phone's browser and continue reading it right
here on my PC.
Molly [ph], I absolutely love this feature and at Microsoft stores, we're showing the
same seamless Microsoft experience across devices using the Samsung Galaxy. The
Microsoft launcher app for Android released just a few weeks ago and it brings a
unique experience to Android users, complementing the productivity experience
with Microsoft apps on a mobile device. By swiping right, I can easily access all of the
tools and apps that I care about the most and since I can link all of my accounts to
the launcher, all of my content, my personal content is accessible here. For example,
the document section shows me a list of all the ﬁles that I recently accessed on any
of my devices and just as Molly showed us that we can pick up the browsing
experience from our phone to our PC, I can also send a notiﬁcation from my Android
to all of my devices so that I can resume viewing this exact same document on
whichever device I am using next.
And from this screen, I can also access all the recent activities that I've engaged in.
All of the people that matter most to me and that I contact most frequently and all of
the apps that I use most often. With Oﬃce 365, Microsoft launcher not only allows
me to have a productive experience. But it also allows me to personalize it, by
creating pages for the things that I use most like my Oﬃce 365 calendar, I can easily
access my calendar just by swiping left from my home screen.
So what you just saw was how a seamless connection of technologies helps us be
more productive on both a mobile device and on a laptop. But we're also lighting up
ambient devices to help you increase your productivity whether you're at home or in
the car. Because Cortana connects directly with Microsoft 365, I can manage my
calendar with just my voice. "Hey Cortana, help me schedule vacation the week of
December 25."
Thank you. With one simple phrase, Cortana takes care of what is normally a
multistep ﬂow to book time oﬀ. Cortana books my time oﬀ in the company reporting
tool, updates my calendar as out of oﬃce, notiﬁes my manager of the day's oﬀ and
sets up my e-mail autoresponder, saving me tons of time and allowing me to get
right back to work.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

Mixed Reality has the potential to help customers and businesses across the globe
do things that until now have never been possible. Mixed Reality experiences will
help businesses and their employees complete crucial tasks faster, safer, more
eﬃciently and create new ways to connect to customers and partners.
ThyssenKrupp is using HoloLens for remote elevator service repair and to digitize
the sales and manufacturing processes of in-home stair lift solutions, improving
processes and reducing their operating costs by up to 4x. Stryker Medical is using
HoloLens to design operating rooms of the future by using holograms for space
planning and collaboration between teams. And Ford is designing vehicles of the
future using HoloLens and mixed reality, allowing them to move more quickly and to
improve collaboration between teams, which is taking processes that used to take
days down to just hours.
Finally, let's talk about gaming. Gaming is one of the most popular forms of
entertainment. And the way people play, watch and interact is changing with game
streaming services like Mixer. It's been an exciting time for gaming over the last few
weeks. The Fall Creators Update delivered improvements for PC gamers. And with
the recently released Xbox One X, the world's most powerful console, we're excited
to deliver gamers incredible experiences and immersive true 4K gaming. Thank you.
Let's roll the video.
Three years ago, Steve Gleason, the former New Orleans Saints football player,
challenged us at Microsoft to create technology that could help him as someone
with ALS to be able to digitally share his thoughts, communicate with the outside
world, talk to his wife and play with his son, Rivers. So a dedicated team worked
together as part of Microsoft's annual hackathon to build technology that could help
people with ALS gain greater independence and enabled Steve to move his
wheelchair with only his eyes. After three years of collaboration between Windows
and Microsoft Research, a new product inspired by this work called Eye Control was
released as a beta in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. I'm on stage with Jay
Cowen [ph]. And he's going to demonstrate this for us.
Thanks, Shun. I'm really excited to be here to talk about Eye Control. For those that
don't know, ALS is a neurological disease that causes you to lose the ability to move
your muscles and to eventually talk and can often leave you with only being able to
move your eyes. At Microsoft, we strive to empower every person on the planet to
achieve more. And we asked ourselves, why shouldn't you be able to use your
computer with only your eyes?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

Shun Grewal
Unidentiﬁed SpeakerWe started this exciting journey by building native support for eye tracking
technology right into Windows. And this enabled us to build Eye Control. At the top
of the screen, you can see the Eye Control launchpad, the starting point for this
experience. And with a compatible eye tracking device, I can interact with this UI
using only my eyes, by simply ﬁxating my eyes on the icon to click it. This unlocks
true hands-free interactions.
Now one of the most diﬃcult consequences of ALS is losing your voice, the ability to
communicate with friends and loved ones, something that's easy to take for granted.
But now windows can be your voice. With the power of input AI, we are able to let
your eyes speak for you. And the Eye Control text-to-speech experience, I can
leverage quick phrases at the top of the screen to let the conversation continue
ﬂowing naturally. I could say something like, "Hello. How are you doing? It's great to
see you."
So all you're doing right now, Jay [ph], I mean your hands are on table, right? You're
just looking at the phrase. And it's being spoken out loud.
That's right. The true power of eye tracking. And in addition to quick phrases, that
can be customized to say anything you want. I can leverage the keyboard to type
anything. And along the way, I can leverage intelligent predictions to help me get
the words out faster. "Now I have a voice."
That's incredible. And this works across other applications as well, right?
That's right. Not only does Eye Control let you communicate. But it lets you control a
mouse and keyboard throughout all of Windows and any application. A great
example is the mail app, which can extend your conversations from in person to any
one over e-mail. I can use my eyes and control where the mouse cursor is. And at this
stage, I can even ﬁne-tune the position and then commence an action like a left click.
And just like that, I have full access to all the apps on my start menu.
Awesome. So we learned pretty quickly though that typing one letter at a time with
your eyes can be slow and tedious over long periods of time. And we challenged
ourselves to make this experience better. Well on the touch keyboard on PCs and
phones, we have a technology called shape writing, which lets you swipe your ﬁnger
on the screen to type words faster. We took that technology and integrated it right
into the Eye Control keyboard to let you do that with your eyes to type even faster.
This is really exciting technology coming together to make something work. Check
this out.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

Really taking a moment there, Jay, to think about what you just did. You just opened
an application, wrote an e-mail and sent it using nothing but your eyes.
That's right. I'm incredibly proud of our team and the work we've done to make this
possible so far. And what's really exciting is this shipped last month in the Windows
10 Fall Creators Update for anyone to use. This work has been truly inspiring. And it
really changed when we started working with people in person living with ALS, like
Steve, to understand the challenges they live with every day. And to ﬁnd ways
technology like this can help improve their lives. We're really excited for the future
opportunities of technology in this to come.
Thanks, Jay.
Thanks so much.
Now in the last couple of years, we've seen the convergence of 3 critical technology
advancements: the cloud, big data and machine learning and reading. This
convergence is helping us unlock the potential of artiﬁcial intelligence to augment
human capability. So today, we wanted to show you how we're enabling AI through
some of our familiar Oﬃce applications. And Nina [ph] here is going to show us how.

Shun Grewaldelivering an online lecture to students around the world. Imagine a multinational
CEO addressing their global workforce. Wouldn't it be nice to provide real-time
transcriptions for anyone in the audience? Wouldn't it be nicer to provide real-time
translations so that anyone can access the presentation in their own native
language? Well that's exactly what we're doing with PowerPoint and Presentation
Translator. Let me show you.
The nice thing about translator is that there's nothing new for me to learn. It's right
here in the PowerPoint experience. I click this button. And a dialog will allow me to
select the language that I'm going to be speaking in my presentation. In this case,
I'm going to select Spanish among 9 diﬀerent languages that are available. Then I'm
going to select the language for the subtitles. In this case, I'm going to select English
among 60 diﬀerent languages that are available. And just like that, I'm going to start
the presentation with subtitles.
I'm going to mute myself for a second just to show you what happened. Notice that
PowerPoint inserted an additional slide with a QR code so that anyone in the
audience can join using their own device and select an additional language if they
want to. Shun, do you want to join using the Microsoft Translator app?
Now we're ready to start the presentation. I'm going to advance the slide. And un-
mute myself. I want you to pay close attention to the translations on the screen.
(foreign language)
That's amazing, Nina. I have absolutely no idea what you were saying. But I can read
it on the phone.
As you can see, I can stand here and speak in Spanish. And you see all of the
subtitles in English. But remember, people who are following along can get the
subtitles in any language they choose. This is all possible using the power of
Microsoft Translation services. And I can even customize the translation model based
on the content of my deck and my voice.
AI is more powerful when there is nothing new to learn, when it is integrated into the
technology that we love and use every single day. And this particular experience is
helping us break through language barriers in amazing new ways.
You know it's incredible to see how empowering the tools within our Oﬃce
applications can be. I recently started graduate school. And though I've always been
an avid OneNote user, I've now started using it in a new way as a student. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

Shun GrewalOneNote and a Surface Pro and a Surface Pen have made that experience incredible.
OneNote is truly enhanced learning experience for me in my economics class.
As you can see here in every lecture, I take quite a few notes to capture the concepts
that my professor is teaching us. He always says he wants to see 3 things for any
question. He wants to see an equation, a graph and an explanation. And the
beautiful thing about OneNote is that it can help me with this. Now I always free-
hand the curves when I'm in class so that I can learn them conceptually. But when I
get home, I use the math tool to graph the equation at scale and compare them.
So over here, I have an equation for a budget line. I'm going to go ahead and select
that equation. And when I click on the math button, you can see that it transcribes
the written equation. And I have a few diﬀerent options here. I'm going to select the
action to graph it. So not only does it give me the graph for that equation, I also have
the opportunity to look at key graph features here: the x and y intercept, the domain,
the range. And when I insert the graph on the page, I can put it right next to the one
that I drew. And with my pen, I can even draw my indiﬀerence curve right on top of
my budget line.
That's deﬁnitely a great example. Now let me show you one in Word. I'm sure most
of you in this room have gone through the process of creating a resume. And while
this is not something that we do every single day, when we do it, we want to make
sure that it's just perfect so it can help us land that next dream job.
Well we know that around 80% of worldwide resumes are created in Microsoft Word.
So we set out to make this task easier with a new feature called Resume Assistant.
Here, I'm going to help my friend Amy with her resume.
Using artiﬁcial intelligence, Microsoft Word has already identiﬁed that I am creating a
resume and has automatically scanned the roles and experiences. Now it took this
information and connected it with LinkedIn to ﬁnd the highest performing examples
for people with similar roles. I can scroll to these examples and get inspiration for
writing my own. I can even ﬁlter by the industry, for example gaming, to get
additional results. And I can get the top skills for this particular role listed by people
in their public proﬁles. This is all made possible using the integration of the LinkedIn
graph and Microsoft cognitive services to help tailor the resume based on the skills
that employees are looking for.
Love that. Now we've shown you just a few of the new innovations that we brought
to market in 2017. We've talked about the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, gaming
and the new Xbox One X, artiﬁcial intelligence and why we think it will be the next

Questions And Answers
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Good morning. I'm Chris Suh, Microsoft's Head of Investor Relations. I'll be the
moderator for today's question-and-answer session. I'll now invite the speakers to
come back out on stage.
I hope you enjoyed that incredible product showcase. If you haven't already done
so, we -- after we conclude the Q&A, I encourage you to visit with the Microsoft Store
associates, who are on hand in the room next door, to experience ﬁrsthand some of
Microsoft's latest products and services. They're also available to assist with any
technical support questions as well.
In the aisles, you'll see microphone stands set up. If you have a question, please
queue up at the stands. There's also a representative at each mic from the Investor
Relations team that can provide any assistance. And we'll try to get to as many
questions as we can. So let's go ahead and start with mic #4.
I recently read that about 95% or more of Internet search -- searches are done with
that other search engine. So I'm just wondering how far is Bing going to go against
this competitor.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
So let me answer that. Overall, we are very, very focused on building the Bing search
technology. That technology investment in fact has helped us grow a lot of our AI,
our capability that you saw today. It's in fact even helped us build some of the
distributed systems infrastructure that's very core part of what we're doing with
Azure. But on search itself, it's a fairly substantial business for us that's growing very
nicely because of the amount of searches that are still done on the PC and in
Windows. And in the context of Windows, our search share continues to grow. So we
are now well north of 20% search share in the United States. The PC search market
happens to be one of the largest markets. And so -- in that sense, for us, it's actually
a growth opportunity. So we continue to make progress month-over-month, quarter-
over-quarter, while also taking advantage of the core technology investment
underneath Bing in many, many diﬀerent areas.

I'm Ken Copley, Capital Executive; shareholder since 1991. To frame my argument or
question, I'm only talking about Windows and Oﬃce for the PC. Why use a consumer
pricing strategy that was basically developed before the Internet, which brought
scale to software service? Learn how to strategically price the consumer software
service to build and protect the legacy of Microsoft. I want to question the strategy
of application design. Operating system, browser, e-mail once dominant positions of
Microsoft, what happened? I'll tell you one reason. With respect to software as a
service, Google has ﬁgured out the relationship between the consumer and the
enterprise. Speciﬁcally, how you can strategically price the software service to
literally create synergy between the market segments. How? Through application
design one software, one service, 2 versions, one for the consumer, one for the
enterprise. They have more functionality security. But both have the same user
interface. Think of it this way. The more consumers you serve, the more value you
create for the enterprise. And this market dynamic maximizes monetization potential.
Fortunately, Microsoft still has a dominant position in Windows and Oﬃce, a great,
great competitive advantage for Microsoft. And again, I just wanted to question the
consumer pricing strategy and the strategy of application design. Thank you.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
The 2 data points that I shared with you today speak very directly to I think what your
question or comment was. It is 28 million subscribers of Oﬃce 365 Home and
Personal, 120 million users of Oﬃce 365 Commercial are 2 sides of the same
product. And that's our strategy. We absolutely think of Windows as a key part of it.
But you can see where we are going with Microsoft 365 and Microsoft 365 at Home
and Microsoft 365 Commercial as essentially the 2 sides of the same coin. This is
something that, as you rightfully pointed out, is our heritage. And that's what we're
going to take forward in a new era where subscriptions and devices come together.

ﬁeld, join Microsoft and other technology organizations and succeed after joining in
their careers. So I don't know, Brad, if you wanted to add more to it.
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Sure. It's a really great point. And what we're trying to do is build the pipeline of
people in this country and elsewhere who, ﬁrst of all, have the opportunity to learn to
code and get exposed to computer science. And in doing that, make sure that we're
taking special eﬀorts to reach girls or women and also ethnic and underrepresented
minorities. We have one signature program that we call TEALS, Technology
Education and Literacy in Schools. This is in 348 high schools in 29 states across the
country this year. But we also have key partnerships with code.org, with Girls Who
Code, with the Boys & Girls Club of America and a variety of other groups. And one
of the things we're measuring every year is what number of participants or what
percentage of participants are female and what percentage of participants are from
underrepresented minorities. And we're focusing on getting into urban cores where
people may have less opportunity and also into more rural areas, especially with the
new partnership with the 4-H.

And just one other program that we're very excited about is DigiGirlz. DigiGirlz is
another program we started a few years ago. And it's exciting for me to see the
graduates of DigiGirlz join Microsoft even as full-time employees. So it's fantastic to
see the progress these programs are making. And we know there's a long way to go.

Thank you for your question. Let's go to mic #3 please.
Tina Escobar [ph], shareholder. Just a quick question about cybersecurity. I know as
we're going to IoT, the cloud and that gets more pervasive, what is Microsoft doing
to ensure the security of all the businesses and people that are using this? Because
as a consumer, you get a little bit, I guess, passive about what we're putting on to the

Absolutely. Overall, the frontier of what is needed in security is rapidly changing, for
the very reasons you described. Whether it's the pervasiveness of technology in our
lives because now it's not just the endpoint device in terms of computing. But it's the
thermostat, it's your doorbell, anything in the house and, of course, in any other
setting. So the approach we're taking is for us as the technology providers, how do
we build all of the software and the devices with the deepest security technology. So
we're making signiﬁcant investments. Out of the gate, any Windows device, forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

A - Bradford L. Smithexample, comes with endpoint protection so to ensure that you can have the best
technology. We also invest and we continue to invest heavily on keeping it up-to-
date. There is no such thing as building something that's secure for all time if it's not
kept fresh so that it can respond to any new threats. Beyond that, one of the other
things that in -- when you think about cybersecurity is it's not just about the security
in the product. But it's the operational security posture that you have. When it comes
to consumers, we have that posture on your behalf.
Because at our -- in our data centers, we see all of the signals across all of the
endpoints. We are continuously monitoring what those signals tell us, create
intelligence out of it so that we can help respond to any threats. So -- and this
doesn't just stop at the Windows endpoint. But it also goes into your inbox in your
mail. Because when we see some threat vector on the endpoint, we make sure that,
that threat vector doesn't propagate, for example, through social phishing. So that's
the approach we're taking across all of our products. This is something that we are
happy to sort of demonstrate and talk more. But cybersecurity all end -- end to end
is a very high priority. The one other comment I'd make on IoT, since you brought it
up, one of the biggest advantages of having Windows devices even in your IoT. And
we have a very good program at Windows IoT is the update capability. When you
sort of think about putting operating systems into new devices and those operating
systems don't have the investment to keep them fresh and up-to-date. From a
security perspective, that's going to be a massive challenge. Whereas with Windows
IoT, you have the one assurance that Windows Update will always ensure security of
that endpoint.

congestion beyond sound transit and the footpath? Because I still think that's just
going to be a nightmare going on 405.

It's HoloLens teleportation. Well the ﬁrst thing we would say is this is a challenge not
just for Microsoft as a company. But it's for all of us who live in this region. And it
really requires a comprehensive approach. And I think the one point that gives us
some encouragement is that we do see increasingly the region taking a
comprehensive approach. And so in part, it has involved improvements in the
highway system, the continued expansion, whether it's 405 or 520 or the I-5
Corridor, it deﬁnitely involves more investment in transit. So we're seeing
investments in buses. The region is doing that. King County is doing that. We're
doing that. Microsoft operates the ﬁfth largest bus service in the state of Washington
with our connector service. So we're always focused on whether we can enhance
that in ways that will reduce the congestion that our neighbors may face. We do see

I'm sure that the folks in this room would agree that Microsoft is on the shortlist of
great U.S.-based corporations, like General Motors' stature in the middle of the
1900s, although the (inaudible) said to Michael Corleone, "We are bigger than U.S.
Steel." So why am I saying this? Well Microsoft is on track to receive a major tax
break along with other corporations, if Congress and the President have a way of
passing this legislation. This tax overhaul is relying on the business segment in
America to invest in all forms of endeavors to move the American economy. My
question to the panel is this. What are Microsoft's intentions vis-Ã -vis this added
revenue? And by the way, your presentation prior to Q&A was spectacular.
Perhaps -- so again, what are your intentions, perhaps to accelerate the educational
needs of our student population at all levels? Could (inaudible) technological
curriculum be the answer? In other words, algorithms must be balanced on the

keeping themselves on that seesaw in the right balance.
Will Microsoft strongly defend and assist the DREAMers? And ﬁnally, be positive --
be a positive voice along with the political action committees on campus to take a
stand against all the ﬂuﬀ and no substance of the leader of this new and dangerous
administration? And a quick P.S. May I respectfully submit to everyone here to read
and possibly reread Sinclair Lewis' satirical novel, It Can't Happen Here. And thank
you for being here.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thank you for your comments, I guess. But the -- let me just start by one thing
though, which you brought up which I think is important. For me, everything starts
with our mission. When we say we want to empower every person and every
organization on the planet to achieve more, each one of those words is not just
words but a guide to how we think about investing for not just our future but more
importantly the people we empower and more importantly the institutions that
people build using our technology that in many cases will outlast them as well. And
I'm a product of Microsoft technology reaching me where I was growing up. So I'm
always reminded of that in terms of the power of what technology can do to create
opportunity for people everywhere. But the most important part of our business
model, in spite of all of our success, the one thing that we are grounded on is our
success rests on our customers' and partners' success. That's core to our businessFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

your point, anything that we can do to continue to invest, to build new technology,
build new solutions that empower more people so that they can be more successful,
make it possible for other institutions to thrive, that's what we will continue to do
with any changing landscape around policy, around tax or others.
(inaudible)
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
I think we have taken a very clear stance. But Brad, if you may want to add to it.
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Yes, I think you'd be hard-pressed to ﬁnd any company that has been more resolute
on the issue of the DREAMers than Microsoft. In part, it reﬂects the fact that we have
45 employees who themselves are registered under DACA. We have employees in
this area that literally have come from 157 countries around the world. So they've
been just fundamental to our success. Obviously, Satya personiﬁes that himself. And
we do worry about the fact that our 45 employees are among the 800,000
DREAMers in this country who currently are having to look at the calendar and know
that if nothing happens on March 6, they'll wake up and potentially face deportation.
So we don't think that is good for our people. We don't think it is good for our
company. We don't think it is good for our shareholders. And we don't think it's
good for the country. So we've actually ﬁled suit. We've stood up and ﬁled briefs in
other suits. And we've made clear to our employees that if any of our 45 employees
face deportation, we'll provide legal counsel for them. We'll stand by their side in
court. We'll seek to intervene in the court proceeding. And we'll ﬁle an amicus brief.
We think that's important.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
I'll just add one other comment because I think this brings up another thing that all
of us are very passionate about, which is when we talk about our mission and
empowerment, creating economic opportunity for everyone is super important,
starting right here in the United States. So the rural broadband program, I think, is
something that we are very, very excited about because I think that that's really a
pressing need to create that economic opportunity in all of our communities. I don't
know, Brad, if you wanted to say a few words about what we are doing there.
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Sure. I mean it is important. One of the things that we recognize is this needs to be a
country where we need to live in a community where there's opportunities, obviously
not only for people who come here from other countries but for everybody who
grows up in this country. And right now, there are literally 23.4 million Americans
who live in rural counties who have no access to broadband. Just think about all of
the services that we are working to provide. And what broadband means for people
in terms of doing homework after school, what it means for a veteran who wants to
get telemedicine coverage, what it means for a small business wanting to create aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

A - Bradford L. Smithjob or what it means for the future of agriculture. So from our perspective, this is
important. And therefore, we've launched an initiative. We call it Airband that where
we've committed ourselves over the next ﬁve years to bring broadband coverage to
2 million rural Americans, always working in partnership with telephone companies
because we're not going to be in that business ourselves. But more broadly, we've
called for a national initiative to completely eliminate the rural broadband gap in the
next ﬁve years.

We're actually going to stay right here at mic #2 for the next question.
My name is Dennis [ph] (inaudible) . And I'm a nurse and a psychologist. And I've
been a Microsoft user since DOS in the mid-'80s. But I don't know much about
gaming. First oﬀ, I want to thank you for the great demonstration and work on the
things that allow people with disabilities to use learning and be productive. I have
several family members with neuromuscular disorders and cognitive disabilities. And
this is going to be fantastic for them. Thank you for that terriﬁc demonstration. But
my question is around what is -- I'm not much of -- even though I've been a longtime
user of Microsoft products, I don't know much about gaming. I've not spent much
time using my computer as a play tool, more a work tool. What is being done in the
world of gaming to address the issues of the social and cognitive and emotional
development of children who are playing the games that are clearly high degree of
energy and sometimes violence? And how do the games take into account the
eﬀects on the development of our youngsters as they are growing up and learning
about violence as a way of solving world's problems? Can you comment at all on
that?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
I mean, ﬁrst of all, we take all of the work around ratings of games very, very seriously
and making sure that everything that's published on our platforms has the proper
ratings. In our own games, which we produce, we absolutely are very focused on
creating in fact content that promotes things like diversity inside of the games. The
content itself is something like, especially something like Minecraft to me is a perfect
game, which not only will give you a lot of entertainment. But it happens to become
one of the most -- best tools to teach essentially STEM in computer science. so we
want to be able to even extend what is this notion of gaming and a form of
entertainment into activities that actually enhance the cognitive capabilities of
people as well as give them entertainment. So therefore, we'll take a broad spectrum
view of how we pursue our gaming. We are recognizing that there is certain games
that have violence in them. And we just want to make sure that the ratings is the way
we warn parents and children about what that may mean to them. I don't know if
Brad or others want to add to any of these?
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
No. I think that addresses it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

Thank you very much. Let's move to mic 1.
My name is Lonnie Lusardo of Seattle. I am a slow learner. The rate of technological
innovation is happening at a pace I can barely keep up with. Seeing the demos
today is very impressive and very positive. But most of it just goes over my head.
And my ﬁrst question to me is how can I use that in a consulting practice? The
question for you is does Microsoft oﬀer a site online where one can go and learn all
the dynamics of these great demos so I can ﬁgure out how to apply that in my work?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Absolutely. And thank you for that question. I mean you're absolutely right. The pace
of technology advance is rapid. We're doing everything possible in the product itself
to make things much more intuitive when it comes to usability, the tutorials and
everything else that you can use while using the product to teach yourself. But one
of the other great resources we have is our professionals in our stores. So as a small
business or an --
(inaudible)
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
I'll come back to even online. So stores is a fantastic place to go as an additional
resource. Then online. So everything that we can do in-store in terms of somebody
explaining how to use a product, how to take advantage of the product is all
available online as well on microsoft.com. So I would encourage you to go in the
product to help in -- to microsoft.com and then our stores, if that makes sense. So
those are the 3 places I would point you to. But your question is something that we
think about all the time because we want to make things more accessible, more easy
and/or more intuitive. Thank you.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Looks like we're down to our ﬁnal question at mic #3.
One follow-up question. You're talking about AI and Machine Learning. Has
Microsoft thought of getting into autonomous driving vehicles and its role in that in
the future?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Sure. One of the things that, at Microsoft, we're very, very clear on is the businesses
we are in and our relationship with other of -- partners and customers. In this context,
we are partnering very broadly with the auto industry, the American carFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

A - Satya Nadellamanufacturers, the Japanese, the German and many others to make sure that they
can take the cutting-edge AI technology. Autonomous driving means you got to
solve the computer vision problem. It turns out Microsoft has signiﬁcant technology
around computer vision. The other part of autonomous driving is even the
connected car scenarios. In fact, we have great traction with all automakers all over
around telematics and connected car scenarios. So we are partnering deeply.
Our intent is to empower many auto companies, whether they are current
incumbents or even new entrants to be able to be very successful in their
autonomous driving vehicles eﬀorts by providing them the technology capability as
building blocks. And so that's our intent in those markets. And what is happening in
autonomous driving in auto industry quite frankly is being replicated in every other
industry that's being digitally transformed. Energy is another example. Retail is
another example. Manufacturing. Our intent is to not get into any business that's
now being digitally transformed but more importantly is to empower people in
those industries to become digital companies. That's core to our strategy. And that's
what's building trust in Microsoft as a long-term technology partner because they
know that we are not there to compete with them, we are there to empower them.
Sorry. One last follow-up question. Will that roll up into like the usage of the cloud or
Azure?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Absolutely, absolutely. Azure is one place you can look at. But it also means things
like Cortana will show up in diﬀerent devices, including cars. So we have lots of
diﬀerent technologies, whether it's on the front end or in the cloud. But cloud is a
place where there is a lot of traction, especially on that particular scenario, or on
autonomous driving and connected car.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Thank you. So this brings this year's annual meeting to a close. We want to thank you
for your attendance today and, of course, sincerely thank you for your support and
investment in Microsoft. Thank you very much.
