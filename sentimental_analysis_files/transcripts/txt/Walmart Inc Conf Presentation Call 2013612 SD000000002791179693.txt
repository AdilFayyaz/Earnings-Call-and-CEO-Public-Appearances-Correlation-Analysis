One business update before we begin, Carol has informed me that Chicago
Blackhawks merchandise is up triple digits, in fact up 700% year-on-year I believe.
And that it's outselling Boston Bruins gear, in case there's any questions for the
game. I don't know how that comes out. But the sales verdict from the world's largest
retailer has been rendered. Okay.

Page 2 of 16Thank you for that sales update. She wouldn't let me do that. We appreciate it. And if
you haven't bought it, go out and buy it please. We'll buy more.
Good afternoon. Thanks for your interest in Wal-Mart. And I appreciate the
opportunity to give you an update on some great things that are happening at our
company.
We'll jump right in. I know we're the last one of the day and there's this large storm
coming. So we'll try to be eﬃcient with our time.
This next slide is my favorite slide. Actually I will be making some forward-looking
statements today. If you have any need for more additional information, please see
our website.
Now, at Wal-Mart we have a cheer and it ends with who's number one. And it's the
customer always. So I think it's appropriate to start with the customer in mind, just
give you our perspective a little bit on what we're seeing with our customer through
the lens of our stores.
Our customer continues to be pressured by the current economic environment. I
think what you see on the top of that slide says it all, are customers adapting to the
current environment. Now while unemployment is down a bit from last year. And
there's a bit uptick in customer conﬁdence, the key things on our customer's mind
you can see are jobs, job security, food and energy prices, particularly for our
customer you see gas price is a big variable for our core customer.
Then you can see, in the general population, the impact of the payroll tax continues
to be on the mind of the general population. And in Wal-Mart US, with the Wal-Mart
moms, our customers, about how do we keep jobs in America. So we're wondering if
we caused that interest. But I think it's pretty powerful that people want their
communities to thrive. And that's what's on their minds.
Our research shows us that our customers continue to look for lower prices,
particularly in challenging times. And they're also looking to eat at home more than
going out. So that's kind of the top lines of what's going on with our customer.
The good news is Wal-Mart is very well positioned for today's environment. If you
think about it, we have a timeless strategy that works very well under any economic
environment. We continue to focus and drive our productivity loop, which is on the
upper left-hand corner of the slide, while we oﬀer a very broad and local assortment.
The productivity really is about how do we buy for less, invest that in our EDLP
pricing to drive the topline, while we leverage productivity across both the supply
chain as well as our store environment. So we then can continue the productivity
loop.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-12

Page 3 of 16Our broad and local assortment, I'll talk about some of the great work that we're
doing there that continues to resonate with our customer. And we're also adapting
to our needs of our customers today that are saying I want to shop anytime,
anywhere. And I want to have product either in the store or delivered to my home, or
wherever they may be. So we believe we have a unique footprint with our 4,000
stores as forward placed fulﬁllment centers interaction sites for our customer.
We have a very solid framework to deliver on our strategy. This is basically the
merchandising framework that we employ. You've heard me talk about the ﬁve Ps
before. It's quite basic. It's the marketing four Ps plus people for ﬁve. I'm really
pleased that the team's done a great job delivering across all of these.
Price obviously, which is really the foundation of Wal-Mart. Second is product. Third
is place, which is really where it comes to life for our customers in our store.
Promotion, this is really about how we communicate and talk to our customer about
our oﬀer, as well as engage with them in diﬀerent sites. Then ﬁnally, our commitment
to our people and how we're making progress there.
In price, we continue to execute our strategy that you've heard us talk about, about
investing in retail price, particularly in our food, our consumable business. So that we
can drive traﬃc to our stores. And we continue to be on pace with that and are
happy with our progress there.
And product, we remain very focused on making sure we have the broadest
assortment. This year. And the coming year, we're very focused on localizing that
broad assortment, store-by-store, community-by-community. So I'll share with you
how we're doing that.
And place, it's really about using our physical footprint, these 4,000 stores that I
talked about. And then leveraging our walmart.com capabilities so we can have a
complete and seamless oﬀer for our customer in their shopping experience,
leveraging walmart.com, whether it be site to store, pick up today, or same day
delivery, depending on which market we're talking about.
In promotion, we're supporting our team messages with our customer. We have a
broad-based campaign in television, in print, in radio. We're both in the social and
digital media that we're always talking to our customers. We've rolled out our local
basket challenge ads to now 75 markets, which cover 70% of our sales across the
United States. And we're also in 14 DMAs with Hispanic and Spanish language ads
on local basket challenge. We continue to be very pleased with the results that we
get from this campaign.
And people, we're focused really on providing our Wal-Mart associates real
opportunities across the company. And I'll give you a brief overview on some of
those key initiatives. We're also investing in our home oﬃce and tools and resources
for our merchants to make them stronger merchants and world class merchants as
we look at the retail competitors across the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-12
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 16Then the common thread that you see here is the R for responsibility. It's about
working on and making a diﬀerence on issues that matter to our customers, like
healthy living, like sustainability, like women's economic empowerment, as well as
domestic manufacturing.
Our common commitment and constant commitment to our customers about EDLP,
every day low price, for our customers every day, this is the foundation of our
strategy. It's really what really fueled growth for Wal-Mart and we remain committed
to this. Quite frankly it builds trust with our customer. And that's why we're so
committed to it. And we continue to invest in price.
I'm really happy about the work that our team has done. And particularly in this
challenging time of economic uncertainty, we continue to deliver on price leadership
in the marketplace. What you'll see is we've actually widened our price gap over the
last 13 months, against our competition by 100 basis points. So we tracked our price
gap, our average unit retail, versus the marketplace, in food, consumables and OTC
products. And over the last 13 months, week ending 4/27, we showed a 100 basis
point improvement in our price separation. So we've talked about we're investing in
price to drive traﬃc and get customer traﬃc. And what you can see here is that in
fact we are driving price leverage and price separation.
Our EDLP commitment is obviously enabled by EDLC because, as a merchant, if you
have EDLP without EDLC, it gets really complicated. So I think you all know that. But
what I want to show you here are four things that I've asked the merchant teams to
work on where we're making a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in our acquisition costs and our
cost of goods sold. We're going to share more information with you in our analyst
meeting in October in Bentonville. But I thought I'd just give you a quick overview of
some of the areas that we're focused on.
The ﬁrst upper left-hand corner there is up streaming. So we're looking at products
where transportation cost represents a signiﬁcant part of the aggregate product
cost. So if you think about things where it could be 15% to 25% of product cost, what
we want to say is how can we maybe up stream that product, either by ourselves or
with a partner. So that we can take that transportation cost and invest it in retail price
and give it back to our customer. So we're looking at diﬀerent ways to do that.
An example we're doing right now in California is we're actually self-distributing
wine. And we've found great advantages, both on our acquisition cost as well as our
distribution costs inside our own stores. There's ﬁve states in the United States that
you can actually self-distribute and California is one of them. So we're pleased with
the economics here and we're going to look at the next four states as we learn more
about this business.
The second is global sourcing. As you know, wherever we can, we can leverage our
scale as a company, not only in Wal-Mart US but also working with our sister
companies, Sam's Club as well as international, where we can direct import to lower
our costs. It also gives us an opportunity to work one-on-one with suppliers to getFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-12
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 16better lead time, better innovation. And a sustainable, dependable supply chain. So
global sourcing has been a great source of lowering our cost over the year.
The third area that you've heard us talk about is our joint business planning process.
We now have about 300 suppliers that we're actively engaged in joint business
planning. And this is where we're working with senior leadership of our supplier
partners. It's a process that we use to get transparency and alignment on key
strategies where we can share investments. It allows us then to work not just one
year out. But two and three years. And some of our companies are letting see
innovation that's coming multi-years down the road. So we can think about what are
the impacts on the store, what can we expect from a consumer. And how should we
think about taking the leadership role in some of these key categories. And should
we start to invest in those. So our JBP process continues to work and work well.
Then last but not least is our initiative on domestic manufacturing, which really is
about us partnering with US suppliers to bring manufacturing back to the United
States. Those two things right, it brings back jobs to the communities in which we
have stores. So we can make a more vibrant economy. And also makes sense from a
business standpoint. Because in many of our categories we're seeing kind of a
crossover point where either labor cost, transportation cost, break factors, response
times from an inventory perspective, we see an opportunity that's good for business
to bring jobs back to America. And we're getting some good traction there. So I'll
share some things with that.
I'm actually delighted the pace at which we've been able to make some change
inside our business model. We announced in January that we buy an additional $50
billion of domestic produced goods in the next 10 years. With that, we then met with
approximately 25 governors of states. And we've had very good engagement. We've
addressed over 3,500 suppliers. We did that back in March as we really formally
engaged our supplier partners.
And we are now going to hold a summit in Orlando in August, really where we're
going to invite back our supplier partners, government oﬃcials, key stakeholders,
where we can start to identify eﬃciencies, local incentives, whether it be community
or state, where we can think about workplace training. So many of our states are
interested in training the workforce and then turning them over to our supplier
partners so they can build that robust job in that community. So we see some great
progress in this space.
The engagement from the likely folks that you think are very, very aggressive.
Suppliers are seeing the opportunity and we're very excited about that. I don't know
if you can see on the slide, there are four diﬀerent examples, between candles,
mattress toppers, bath towels and coolers.
The one on the far left is Hanna's Candles which is an Arkansas candle manufacturer,
which last year we did $4 million with. We said how can we change the dynamics of
our candle business. And this year we committed to doing $30 million. And we'll doFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-12
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 16$45 million by 2017. Again, multi-year contracts building so they can invest in people,
they can become more eﬃcient in their plants. And we can have a sustainable supply
chain and drive innovation because it's not a transactional relationship. But a more
meaningful long-term relationship. And it is in fact working. That will create 50 jobs
in Arkansas just for this small candle manufacturing. So you can make a diﬀerence
town by town, community by community.
The second example I'd give you is the mattress toppers. A company called
Authentic Comfort is a new supplier to us. And before this year 100% of all of our
mattress foam toppers came from China, 100% were produced in China. Because of
rising costs in China, particularly the internal domestic demand actually was rising,
labor cost, energy cost, they were going to pass on some cost increases. So it gave
us an opportunity to think about this diﬀerently. And we're going to now buy 20% of
our needs now manufactured in the United States. So these are the kind of examples
that say it's still going to be good for China, we're going to just bring some jobs
back to America. And we see great opportunity here. And it is in fact very good for
business.
Freight factor obviously is another one here. When we're shipping light products,
anything high cube. And also where you need good response time, the economics
really do look favorable for us. So this is good for the communities. But it's very good
for our business.
Another key deliverable from our merchandising team is we've talked about
bringing back about 10,000 items over the last couple of years. But the key now is
about delivering quality, new brands and product innovation to our customers. You'll
see on this slide a number of brands that you might not have seen before in a Wal-
Mart store.
In outdoor living for example, we've brought and expanded our assortment of our
Weber grill platform. You think about the folks that are grilling, this is a great
endorsement, a powerful brand, that resonates great with the Wal-Mart customer.
And we're excited about having that expanded assortment in our stores across the
country.
We've also added Snapper lawnmowers this year into our lawn and garden
assortment. And it's been very well received by our customers. Again, great quality,
great price leadership at your local Wal-Mart store.
Another one, the gentleman in the beard there, are the friends at Duck Dynasty. I'm
not sure this crowd probably watches Duck Dynasty. Anybody? Anybody? Okay. It's
an amazing show. And I'll tell you what, the Wal-Mart customer loves it. And this, talk
about seeing a trend, optimizing it. And making a diﬀerence. And believe it or not,
the number one selling graphic t-shirt inside of Wal-Mart, wait for it, Duck Dynasty,
okay. That applies for men's and boy's, okay a no brainer. But ladies', yes. Number
one selling t-shirt, graphic t-shirt in ladies'. So it's, again, this about -- and the
innovation there is a great partnership with a great story that we merchandise overFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-12
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 1610 departments across our store, because it resonates in diﬀerent places. And again,
it's kind of expect the unexpected as you shop the Wal-Mart store.
A couple of new brands that I'm pretty excited about, is we're going to launch Avia
tennis shoes in July. So next month you'll see Avia tennis shoes in the shoe
department at Wal-Mart. Then also Russell Athletic apparel will be in our stores in
September. And with Avia, we're going to launch next month. And we'll have a 15%
to 20% price gap to other retailers. And we're going to have enough shoes to
basically line them up between here and Bentonville and back.
So we're excited about the sales opportunity that will really bring a diﬀerent
customer for us. And again, brings another well-recognized brand into our store and
will drive traﬃc into our shoe department and our apparel path so we're very excited
about that. And you'll hear more about Russell Athletic wear as well as we get into
the fall season and football gets back in gear.
On the right side where you see exclusivities and innovation, a number of things.
There's the $99 tablet that we just launched. And there's also a $149 tablet. Explosive
growth in this category, providing great value to our customer. Flower cosmetics is a
great fast-growing cosmetic and exclusive to Wal-Mart.
Then I'd just highlight, in the lower right-hand corner, is a $3.98 bra. When we looked
at our intimate business, we had missed the price gap that we ﬁlled with a $3.98 bra.
And this has been virtually all incremental sales to our business and has really been
driving our sales across this department. And it is driving a lot of traﬃc as well. So
just some examples of innovation and exclusivity. And bringing well-recognized
brands to our store.
I mentioned before on product, we brought back many brands before. This is really
the year of localization. So this is in food, my goal is to have actually store-speciﬁc
modulars across the key categories. And we're making great progress there. In
consumables, we really take a cluster approach, because if you think about food, it's
very local, very neighborhood based. And very regional.
And consumables, it tends to be more national, perhaps regional. And the
diﬀerences there might be brand proﬁle, they might be package size. So we're
actually going to use clusters. And if we just think about consumables for example,
we're looking at many diﬀerent factors like income. We're looking at what our
competitors handle, ethnicity, geography, demand, the pace of sales, if you will. And
then the customer decision (tree) is to really decide what we're going to really oﬀer
store by store. We're really utilizing our Nielsen and our NRI data. And our
consumables teams have done a great job to do this. And as a matter of fact, it's
making a real diﬀerence as we roll out these modulars.
In food, for example, we see a real opportunity. You might think well you guys have
been in food a long time, you're the largest food retailer, this should be a no brainer.
Ice cream, for example, we did the data with the Nielsen analysis and we found 110FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-12
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 16regional brands that we didn't sell before. So this is really resonating with our
customer. And making it come to life for us at stores. So we'll have over 3,500 store
speciﬁc modulars. So not only do we get the regional needs. But we also get the
holding capacity on the fastest selling items. So you make sure that you have an in
stock as well as the right products for our customer.
Another key focus area for us, that you've probably recently read about, is on driving
results in fresh, speciﬁcally in our produce business. Last year you heard us talk
about our meat business. And we focused aggressively on our meat business. And
we're very happy and delighted with the success that we've had there. So I'm really
excited about taking that same passion, that focus and those resources. And placing
them on our produce business.
If you talk to customers, there's two areas that they think about food, they want great
meat and they want great produce. Absent to that, you're likely to miss some of the
rest of the food shop. So we made a great commitment here. And what you can see
is they think about it really from farm to fork, if you will.
So from the farm perspective is we basically working with local growers. We've
placed our buyers and our sourcing agents in the ﬁeld so they can work closely with
our local farmers. And we're also buying directly from them. We're consolidating it
from a supply chain so we can add more freshness and more deliveries to our store.
So we give more time in the customer's refrigerator for better value and better
freshness and better quality.
We spent a signiﬁcant amount of time training our store associates so they
understood what good produce looks like and what customers should expect when
they see it. So our operators are absolutely fantastic with this. And we feel very good
about it. We conduct weekly audits with a third party audit ﬁrm that looks at every
store, every week across the fruit and vegetable commodities. Then if they pass, they
pass, if not, they fail. And they get a scorecard. And our operators get store by store
speciﬁcs. So we're making a diﬀerence for our customer.
We also then feel so good about this, we guarantee 100% guarantee of freshness for
our customer and satisfaction. Don't need to bring the product back, bring your
receipt in, we'll give you your money. And the product and the customer experience
resonating, we're very happy with the early returns. And we really just kicked this oﬀ
three weeks ago. So I'm excited about the progress we've made there.
You can see here, WIBI is just would I buy it, if you're a customer. If you're an
associate, if you'd buy it, leave it there, if you don't, take it oﬀ the sales ﬂoor. And this
is the balance between freshness and quality. And you can see that our comps have
been growing nicely.
What I'd like to do now is -- there's two ads I'd like to show you. First is the fresh over,
which is similar to our steak over campaign. And I'll let you just watch that. Then aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-12
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 16local basket challenge ad that we ran here locally. So if we could run those two ads
please.
(video playing)
It's great stuﬀ. We continue to be very happy with both these campaigns. The
produce one is very early. But the customers vote with their feet and we're excited
about the opportunity there. And the local basket challenge will continue.
One of the other key areas that we have focused on is obviously operational
execution at store level. One of the things the merchants are doing with the
operators is saying how do we make modular recess easier. So A, we did fewer last
year so we could actually give time back to our operators to focus on the customer.
The second thing that we've been looking at is capacity in the modular across the
categories to make sure that we have the holding power needed to get through our
heavy sales days, which are typically the weekend. Then we also introduced what we
call mini mods. So where we might have three to ﬁve items, historically we'd reset
the whole area, now we just go up and just touch the items that are important. So it
makes us more nimble, keeps us ﬁrst to market. And it helps lower cost and leverage
our operational eﬃciency.
Another thing that we did is we launched a program called SPARK, which Supplier
Portal Allowing Retail Coverage. So it basically takes your iPhone or your Android
device and allows you then to use it as a Telxon if you've been trained and certiﬁed
as a supplier. That allows them to check if there's an empty spot on the shelf, to say is
there product in the backroom. If so, they can scan it, they can see it. And they can
bring it to an associate or they can ﬁll the shelf themselves. So it's just a great
partnership to allow us to leverage on-shelf availability for our supplier partners. And
ultimately meet the needs of our customer. So we feel good about where we've
been on shelf availability and our operational standards.
The next area of focus for our company. And you've heard Neil Ashe and Bill Simon
talk about this. But really about how do we leverage our physical footprints and our
dotcom capabilities. So we think we've got a unique business model because quite
frankly we have 4,000 fulﬁllment centers that are next to most Americans. And how
do we leverage that ability that no one else can do that. It's almost, as Bill talks
about, the convergence of digital and retail space. And then we can uniquely deliver
for our customer.
Some of the things that we're doing, obviously leveraging our technology and our
innovation from our global ecommerce partners is things like obviously ship from
store, which we're piloting our site to store, which is becoming a bigger and bigger
part of the business today. Same day deliver. We also announced a locker test where
we'll forward place the product for you to them come pick up.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-12
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 16Some of the other opportunities, whether you're an express store, a neighborhood
market, or a supercenter, an Endless Aisle. You should then basically have access to
all the items that we have at walmart.com. We should be able to get it to you either
the same day if you're in a small store, or the next day if you're in a supercenter.
We've launched Scan & Go, which allows our customer to do basically self-checkout
and scan throughout their shopping experience. And also have an in-store mode so
they can understand where there's product and what kind of quantities we have. And
also Pay with Cash online, they can come to the store and pay with cash. So again
leveraging our physical assets with our digital capabilities and innovation.
Another area that we're very proud of is about our commitment to our people, that
ﬁfth of the ﬁve Ps, is providing real opportunities for each one of our associates. And
there's three key areas really. It's about priority, it's about access. And it's about
visibility.
And the priority is basically we've built a new system that allows all of our associates
to have opportunity to see open positions that they can apply to. Before, they may
not have had that visibility. And we might have hired somebody else and this person
may have wanted diﬀerent hours or more hours. So we now allow that person to
actually have access open positions they'd be interested in.
Access to open shifts, again same technology saying I want to work more or I want to
work a diﬀerent time. This system allows them to do that so they can work more
hours if that in fact is what they want to do.
Then ﬁnally visibility to supervisor roles. So folks that want to get into management,
or take a diﬀerent department lead job in the store, they have an opportunity now to
see that, either in their store or in the neighboring stores. And before they wouldn't
have had visibility to do that. We're very excited about this and our associates I think
are going to see it pay big beneﬁts long-term.
Also, we want to comment a little bit on the responsibility component, is that we are
in fact leading on issues that matter to our Wal-Mart customer. I just want to highlight
three key areas here.
The ﬁrst is our women economic empowerment initiative. We are on track to reach
our -- our commitment was, we'd buy $20 billion of business from women-owned
businesses between Wal-Mart US and Sam's by 2017. And we are in fact on track to
meet that goal. That's the right thing for the business, it's the right thing for our
communities. And we feel very good about the progress there.
On Memorial Day you may have read that we did launch a program to basically hire
honorably discharged veterans within one year of discharge. And we're really
excited about this. We've had a signiﬁcant number of applications. We've already
hired 650 veterans. We love hiring veterans. They're dependable, they're great
workers, they have a great work ethic. And they ﬁt well in the Wal-Mart culture. SoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-12

Page 11 of 16Q - Mark Miller
A - Duncan Mac Naughtonthis is a huge opportunity for us to engage with some great associates and future
associates. And it's got some great traction and we've only been doing it for about a
week and a half so it's been excellent.
And the third area is our healthy food initiative. And we launched this and talked
about how can we take trans fats, how do we take sugar, how do we take sodium out
of our products. And then how do we also help our customers save money and eat
better. And we don't believe at Wal-Mart that folks should have to pay more to eat
healthy. And we've already accomplished a $2.3 billion saving in our produce
initiative to help people eat better across our stores. The healthy living great for you
icon has got great traction and we continue to work on that. So we're excited about
those three key components.
What I'd like to do is, before I wrap up, is show a veteran's commercial that we just
launched with our Memorial Day initiative.
(video playing)
Great campaign. And we feel if you fought for your country, you shouldn't have to
ﬁght for a job.
So in the spirit of time, I want to wrap up. We'll well positioned to serve our
customer. Our EDLP/EDLC campaign is on track. Broad assortment is working. We're
making our associates opportunities better and better every day. And we feel real
good about where we are. Thank you.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 3105655 <GO>}
I'll kick oﬀ with the ﬁrst question and then (inaudible; microphone inaccessible).
{BIO 6052579 <GO>}
Sure, speciﬁc down line price matching. Yes. The question is really asking about
some of our competitors have decided to price match online competitors. And what
would our stance be and what are we considering.
Today we don't currently do that. If you study it, actually those prices change
numerous times during the day on the same product. And as we looked in our
presentation, we're about building trust, consistent everyday low prices, that the
customer can count on every day.
As we look at that, we feel that we have price leadership across the business, both
physical and in the ecommerce world. And we're comfortable with where our price
leadership is today. So at this time, we don't plan to do that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-12

The question was, what is the most compelling opportunity we see for growth across
Wal-Mart today.
There's obviously going to be some very dynamic fast growth across the global
ecommerce space. But I will tell you that in across Wal-Mart US, it's the convergence
of leveraging our assets with global ecommerce. And I think the acceleration of
small footprints also will be a great opportunity for us to grow topline sales and
service areas today that we don't have stores. So a bit of the building stores, ﬁlling in
our network. And leveraging the potential global ecommerce.
Yes sir?
(inaudible; microphone inaccessible)
{BIO 6052579 <GO>}
Sure. The question was really about what's in the basket of dynamics change
between branded and perhaps private label products. And also EBT impact as
month time had an impact on our shopper.
I will tell you that we're really about a house for brands ﬁrst. So we're all about selling
national brands because we can demonstrate price leadership on branded product.
We have a great oﬀering in our private brands across the store that we're quite
proud of. We have not seen a dramatic change in that behavior between branded
and private branded product today.
I will tell you that we have, for about two years, really since the economy has been a
bit bouncy, a reliance on electronic beneﬁts. And states tend to now smooth those.
So the states have been moving those across the month. We still see an impact the
1st, the 3rd and the 15th. And then because states have moved it across the states,
you can tell by state where there may be a variance. So our core customer is still
quite reliant on EBT. But I think they've been able to balance their budget and their
need states.
Anything else? Yes sir?

Sure. How has internet retailing changed our perspective and our merchandising
mix in our store?
I think many of -- there's key categories that just fast adapted to ecommerce, right,
like music. Movies would be one that many people are starting to look at diﬀerently.
We still sell a lot of physical movies and we intend to continue to sell a lot of physical
movies. So particularly in the entertainment area, I would say it had a signiﬁcant
impact for us. So we're always looking at how do we optimize space in that store so
we can fast adapt.
Our key is, how we can use ecommerce to actually sell the Endless Aisle to our
customer. When they're in our store, we'd love to sell them a product. But if they
don't have that product I'd like them to go to walmart.com and buy a product there,
either ship it to the store for free shipping, or ship it to their home.
Obviously I think today people use ecommerce Internet retailing for knowledge
beneﬁt. They're researching products and then they're going to come in and they're
going to check our prices, or they're going to check their prices online, or they're
going to stand in our aisle and they're going to check the price. Bring it on. We love
it, because we feel good about our price leadership.
Yes?
(inaudible; microphone inaccessible).
{BIO 6052579 <GO>}
Yes. We've always had web only merchandise. The question is, are we adding
signiﬁcant SKUs for the Endless Aisle? And we are always updating our assortment
online. We feel that we can do that in a pretty productive way. And particularly with
third party relationships, we should be able to have an expanded line of assortment
without necessarily adding all the carrying costs. But the team in walmart.com works
closely with our team at Wal-Mart Bentonville to make sure that we're aligned on our
strategy across the assortment.
(inaudible; microphone inaccessible).
{BIO 6052579 <GO>}
Yes, I think it's two million online today. An average supercenter would have 150,000
just for reference.

Sure. Mike, you might want to help me from an operator perspective. Obviously one
of the things with our produce initiative, for instance, we're looking at, because of
the consolidation we're doing of local farming, we're actually trying to actually
eliminate the shrink at warehouse level so we can optimize retail sales space. So
actually as we do that, we can actually lower shrink in our produce model, which is
pretty eﬀective.
We've not seen a signiﬁcant issue in shrink from a theft perspective, for instance. And
the operators are always working on ways that they can manage their inventory and
their receipt and keep their perpetual inventory accurate so that we minimize shrink.
And Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything?
{BIO 1643144 <GO>}
I think that's about it. You know, one of the things -- or I would say that one of the
things we continue to do is really watch inventory levels in the store. If you don't own
it, you can't shrink it. And so with PI accuracy, really watching what we have in the
back, what we have ﬂown to the stores. And the merchants have worked with us on
ﬂow, we really haven't had an issue right at this point.
(inaudible; microphone inaccessible).
{BIO 6052579 <GO>}
Well we're always looking at both. I can't say that. We look at both sides of it. We
have a lot of AP folks that are always in our stores, watching our customers and
looking for ways to make sure that we're selling the product out the front door.
{BIO 1643144 <GO>}
You know our biggest opportunity to0, you know as Duncan talked about,
everybody's concerned with theft. But the biggest opportunity we think an average
supercenter may receive 15, 20 trailer loads worth of merchandise coming in the
back door. When it comes to retail shrink, there's a bigger opportunity to make sure
that the accounting is right than there is from somebody stealing it. And that
continues to be a focus. So we're focused on the ﬂoor from a safety and security
issue. But we're also trying to make sure that our record keeping and everything
coming in the back door is accounted for.

Will there be a sales transfer maybe between supercenters, neighborhood markets
and express stores as we expand it?
(inaudible; microphone inaccessible).
{BIO 6052579 <GO>}
Without a loyalty card, we don't, necessarily can't track each customer. But I will tell
you that as we look, we think the diﬀerent formats oﬀer diﬀerent trips. So there's a
stock up trip, there's a convenience trip, there's a quick needs trip. We actually think
in total, it will all be additive. And there may be some blurring between our
customers. But as long as they're in the Wal-Mart family, we welcome them to shop
any of those stores.
(inaudible; microphone inaccessible).
{BIO 6052579 <GO>}
I think there is -- my ﬁrst slide is basically what they're always interested in, to see if
there's any dynamics that they may not see in the data point. And we're pretty
transparent with them on what we see. I tried to paraphrase for you in that ﬁrst slide
in essence what we share with them.
Just one more. Yes sir?
(inaudible; microphone inaccessible).
{BIO 6052579 <GO>}
The question is really about, we have produce laid out in diﬀerent stores, in diﬀerent
places, the walls may be in diﬀerent places, why is that? Then do we see produce in
baskets with food only or cross merchandise?
And I'll tell you, we're really proud of the 4,000 stores we have. And they all look
diﬀerent. So there are -- we do have common prototypes. But as we've kind of
evolved the format, we have some of those diﬀerences. We do have a current format
that we have in diﬀerent sizes that we're using. We do like produce to be upfront and
the right wherever we can, in a two-door entrance supercenter. So we ﬁnd that to be
most engaging for our customers.
And we do see baskets that -- our best basket of course is across the whole store.
And most of our customer baskets have a mix of diﬀerent departments in them. SoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-12

Well I'd just like to thank you again on behalf of Wal-Mart for being here. Have a
great day.
