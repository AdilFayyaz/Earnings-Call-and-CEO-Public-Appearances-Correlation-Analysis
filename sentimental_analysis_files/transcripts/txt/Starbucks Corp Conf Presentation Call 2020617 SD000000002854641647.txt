{BIO 6061984 <GO>}
David Palmer, Evercore ISI's food and restaurant analyst. I'm really excited and
honored to have Pat Grismer, Starbucks' CFO, with us here today.
Pat joined the company in late 2018 from Hyatt, having recently been the CFO there.
And prior to that, he spent 14 years at Yum! Brands in various ﬁnance roles.
So he certainly knows the role, and he knows global brands.
Welcome, Pat.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Thank you. Glad to be here.
{BIO 6061984 <GO>}
You provided a lot of good disclosure last week. So thank you for that.
We can circle back to some questions that we have about the recovery in the near-
term realities.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 6061984 <GO>}
But perhaps I was wondering if you could start oﬀ with a comment about how you
think Starbucks will be positioned immediately after the COVID period is behind us,
sort of that medium-term view.
I think more speciﬁcally, I think investors are seeing economic and commuter
headwinds that might linger, but also recognize that Starbucks has done pretty much
everything right as far as we can tell and through the virus for its partners, leaning in,
in terms of store format and digital.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-17

Page 2 of 13A - Patrick GrismerSo this can mean bigger share gains and maybe even margins ahead.
So maybe tee us up with a comment about how you're thinking about exiting this
crisis.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Certainly, David. Thank you. Now let me start by saying that current challenges and
future headwinds aside, we are very optimistic about the future, and we're taking
steps to ensure that Starbucks will emerge from this experience even stronger. The
progress we're making in our two lead growth markets, the U.S. and China, reinforce
our belief that we will fully recover our business in due course.
We continue to expect that China's comparable sales will trend towards slightly ﬂat
by the end of our ﬁscal fourth quarter, and that the U.S. will continue to show
improvement with recovery extending into next ﬁscal year.
At Starbucks, the third place has always been about community connection and
convenience. And we know that in the current environment, likely to continue for
some time, physical distancing is a vital need state for customers.
We already have a variety of ordering and service channels that provide a
contactless experience, including drive-through, entry way pickup with Mobile Order
& Pay and delivery. And additionally, the transformation of our store portfolio and
the acceleration of innovative store formats, like Starbucks pickup, and new
operating protocols, like curbside delivery, aligned with customer preferences that
have evolved as a result of COVID-19, enabling us to connect with customers and
serve our communities safely and even more conveniently. Combined with our focus
on the customer experience beverage innovation and digital assets, we are well
positioned to regain the momentum we had before COVID-19.
Now that said, as you mentioned, disruption to weekday morning routines, notably,
commuting to work and school, is the strongest headwind that we're facing and will
be more diﬃcult to recover. However, there are two key tailwinds that we are -- that
are helping Starbucks. First, strong brand loyalty, which is inspiring customers to
replace past routines with new routines in diﬀerent locations and at diﬀerent times of
the day. Second, consumers' desire in an increasingly stressful world for the comfort
and the care that are unique to the Starbucks Experience.
So we're leaning in on these brand strengths as we continue to execute the game
plan that was instrumental to pre-COVID success, an elevated partner in customer
experience, breakthrough beverage innovation and increased digital customer
engagement.
Now with respect to the broad economic headwinds, we expect, likewise, brand
loyalty will provide some measure of support to our business, along with the fact that
a Starbucks Experience is seen as an aﬀordable treat.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-17

{BIO 6061984 <GO>}
That's great, Pat. I can attest to my wife and daughter being -- using this as an
aﬀordable break these days. I wanted to circle back and reﬂect on your last couple of
years at Starbucks, which have been pretty good years, ones where you've been
improving.
The ﬁrm broadly has been improving leading up to that 8% monster same-store
sales immediately preceding the COVID-19 crisis. What did you see at Starbucks
when you were joining? What progress do you see in the inside and the
opportunities that -- versus the opportunities you saw at the beginning?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well under the leadership of our CEO, Kevin Johnson, the growth at scale agenda
had been clearly established, focusing the company on a tight list of priorities while
also enabling that focus through targeted streamline initiatives to simplify the
business and drive eﬃciencies.
Shortly after I joined, we introduced a new long-term growth model to clarify the
building blocks of sustained double-digit EPS growth at scale. Since then and until
the impact of COVID-19, we've been very much focused on disciplined execution of
the growth at scale agenda, allocating resources to the highest priorities, which are,
again, elevating the partnering customer experience, driving beverage innovation
and increasing digital customer engagement, while also sustaining strong net store
growth and capitalizing on our global coﬀee alliance with Nestlé, which has
extended the reach of the brand.
This tight focus, combined with disciplined execution, have contributed to steadily
strengthening operating results while also helping to unlock growth. And then
COVID-19 arrived, and our focus has really been on, ﬁrst, mitigating and containing
the spread of the virus, then monitoring and adapting to the current environment,
and now, fully restoring the business and building resilience for the future.
{BIO 6061984 <GO>}
I want to follow up on that beverage part of the equation. Domestic trends,
particularly in the domestic side of the business. It seems like beverage contribution
has been a big part of the improvement. I think the beverage contribution had been
in the 2% range in the old days when you were just joining. It's been more like three
to six points lately. To what do you attribute this beverage contribution gap, this
improvement?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well we're particularly pleased with the innovation in our cold beverage platform,
which has become increasingly popular at all times of the day. Cold beverages haveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-17
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 13A - David Palmergrown in popularity over the last four years. And while there's naturally, as you would
aﬀect some seasonality between winter and summer, the fact is that the platform has
continued to grow even in the colder months every year. Key drivers of that have
been innovation around Cold Brew, Nitro, Cold Brew, Cold Foam, iced teas and
refreshers.
So a whole range of cold beverages. And those collectively have helped to mute the
impact of a decline in the more indulgent cold beverage platform, frappuccino.
Our focus on beverage innovation is moving toward diﬀerentiated platforms rooted
in well-researched consumer insights with less reliance compared to past years on
beverage LTOs and sparks that really don't have a lasting impact. These innovative
beverage platforms create new opportunities for us to introduce seasonal variations
on a more regular basis.
Now at the same time, we're also rolling out new and sometimes proprietary
beverage brewing and dispensing technologies at scale.
So that includes our Nitro Cold Brew as well as our Mastrena two espresso machines,
and that delivers the best coﬀee quality and consistency at improved speed of
service, and it meets customers' evolving preferences, including for wellness.
Now following the holiday season this past year, which was our best ever, we added
more plant-based milk beverages, knowing consumers are increasingly looking for
those alternatives, yet providing customers the ability to customize their beverages
with those alternative milks. This included a regional rollout of oat milk in the
Chicago area, and we plan to expand that in the coming months.
More recently, for our spring season, we introduced Pineapple Matcha and Golden
Ginger, both iced coconut milk drinks that have quickly become fan favorites. And
then as we reopen stores in May, we introduced a new summer lineup of beverages
and food. That included our Iced Guava Passion Fruit drink, another hand-shaken
coconut milk-based beverage. Our upcoming follow-on promotion will include even
more innovation in the beverage -- in the cold beverage space.
So we'll continue to innovate there while further enhancing our Cold Brew and Nitro
platforms, delivering, again, seasonal innovations, such as this last year, Pumpkin
Cream Cold Brew and Irish Cream Cold Brew. And then ﬁnally, introducing even
more textural variations, capitalizing on our proprietary Cold Foam at scale.
So plenty of room for innovation with so many highly diﬀerentiated platforms that
we've deployed across our business at scale.
{BIO 6061984 <GO>}
That's great. You guys have really improved a lot on the beverage side. It's been
super impressive.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-17

A - Patrick GrismerLet's talk about loyalty and digital a bit. U.S. loyalty membership growth has
accelerated in the last few years. It had been dipping as low as 8% or so. It's now
mid-teens. Clearly, China digital usage has been ramping really hard lately, but I
think it's just as interesting how at scale, when you're doing it, it's still rapid growth in
the U.S. Could you speak to the digital contribution's growth and how that might be
changing due to the crisis?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Great questions, David.
So before the onset of COVID-19, we had seen the contribution from digital from our
loyalty program increase from about one point of comp to two points of comp.
We're really pleased that the more recent loyalty oﬀers and enhancements to digital
that we've launched coming out of COVID have really reengaged customers and
have helped to drive sales, as evidenced by a meaningful increase in average weekly
downloads and activations of the Starbucks mobile app since the campaign started
in early to mid-May.
Customers are increasingly reliant on the mobile app with new users adopting the
app for contactless ordering. Average retention amongst new users increased
relative to pre-COVID levels, and they represent a larger share of app visits.
We continue to utilize various digital tools and techniques to drive traﬃc into our
stores, including loyalty, program promotions and personalized oﬀers.
We're also seeing increases in digital engagement in China, as you mentioned,
compared to pre-COVID-19, and that appears to be fairly sticky in terms of
consumers pivoting to more Mobile Order & Pay and mobile order for delivery
experiences.
{BIO 6061984 <GO>}
During the last call, you talked about how digital has -- you're getting better at doing
digital. It's not just about penetration. It's the ways that you're doing more
personalized marketing and operational adjustments to that digital. Could you speak
to that angle and how you're perhaps leveraging digital better?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Absolutely. It's something that we are especially pleased with because we think that
it is a signiﬁcant competitive advantage for us and something that will continue to
fuel our recovery from the current COVID-19 impacts.
But really, over the last ﬁve years, the company has made very signiﬁcant, very
thoughtful investments in our digital ﬂywheel, and it has become much more
powerful with each passing year. And of course it's anchored by our Starbucks
Rewards program, which enhances the customer experience through some veryFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-17
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 13relevant features that provide customers with a convenient way to place orders and
to receive, as you mentioned, those highly personalized oﬀers that unlock value and
drive incremental spending.
So kind of with that as a background, about a year ago, we enhanced the Starbucks
Rewards program in the U.S., signiﬁcantly increasing the ﬂexibility with which
customers can redeem stars or loyalty rewards, and we call that multi-tier
redemption.
These changes were very well received by customers pre-COVID and continue to be.
Growth of our 90-day active rewards members accelerated to 15% year-over-year
growth in our second ﬁscal quarter, reaching 19.4 million active members at the end
of the second quarter. Loyalty members accounted for 44% of U.S. tender, and we
see evidence of continued growth in the current environment.
So let me tell you a little bit more about this multi-tier redemption, because I think
it's important to understand what changed from a design perspective and why that's
resonating so strongly with our customers. The multi-tier redemption has enabled
current -- or continued growth in the member base and has also helped to drive
member engagement for new members. Attracting new customers to become
members of the loyalty program is a strategic imperative for us because we know
from our experience over a period of years that when we convert members or
customers from nonmembers to members, we see their spending increase.
We see an increase in frequency, and we see an increase in average spend. And
those changes in customer behavior tend to be very sticky.
So it's a strategic imperative for us. And multi-tier redemption has proven to be a
very signiﬁcant unlock for us in that regard.
The previous program had a -- what we call the green tier, which was a barrier for
some customers in terms of joining the program. New members had to earn 300
Stars just to reach gold status, and then they had to earn another 25 Stars to reach
their ﬁrst reward.
So -- or that was 125 Stars.
So net-net, they add to amass or accumulate 425 Stars before they could earn their
ﬁrst reward. The new program eliminated the green tier altogether.
So new members can start redeeming as early as 25 Stars now. Additionally, they can
now redeem their Stars at ﬁve diﬀerent tier levels, ranging from 25 to 400 Stars. And
as we've added new items such as merchandise and at-home coﬀee for which
members can redeem stars, these changes collectively are resonating with our
customers in a very signiﬁcant way and contributed to the growth in our active
member base, as I mentioned before.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-17
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 13A - David Palmer
A - Patrick GrismerWe do expect to see higher levels of digital engagement going forward as
customers appreciate the eﬀortlessness of the experience and they see the value of
becoming a Starbucks Rewards member.
So the last thing I'd like to highlight here is what we're doing next, what's next to
build on this outstanding momentum that we've built with our digital ﬂywheel. And
that's something we call Stars for Everyone. It's been in the works for several years
now, and I'm excited to say that we're reaching the end of the development phase,
and we do anticipate launching this towards the end of this ﬁscal year.
We expect that it will meaningfully impact business results next ﬁscal year.
And here's the insight. One of the most signiﬁcant barriers preventing our customers
from signing up for our rewards program is the requirement to preload payment
onto a Starbucks gift card in order to earn Stars.
So to remove this barrier, we're launching a program where any customer who
registers a credit card or a debit card can earn Stars. And it's a way to attract
customers who wish to beneﬁt from our rewards program and all the value that, that
unlocks and all that, that enables by way of personalized oﬀers without having to
prepay through a gift card.
So again, in the ﬁnal stages of development, expect to launch toward the end of this
ﬁscal year with meaningful impact next ﬁscal year.
So collectively, all of these innovations are helping to reinforce and strengthen,
which is something that is a key competitive advantage to us and something that we
view as a tailwind to our recovery coming out of COVID-19.
{BIO 6061984 <GO>}
That's very cool. That's under the category of why didn't you do this earlier. This is --
seems like such a good idea. One of the things that you talked about last week and
previously was store format. It's obviously a hot topic. You've been talking about
transforming the asset base in the U.S. with more pickup locations to go with your
drive-throughs, which are already the majority of your growth. This plan will include
some closures. I think there's curiosity about what this all will mean in terms of
renegotiated rent reduction.
But perhaps we can focus on, because it's probably too early to say, on what that
rent impact is going to be.
But could you just speak to the returns diﬀerence, just the economics of those
pickup formats and your drive-throughs relative to the traditional walk-in stores?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-17
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 13Thank you, David, and I appreciate the opportunity to kind of step back from this
and share how we're thinking about this strategically. Now the fact is that drive-
throughs will remain the leading driver of net store growth for Starbucks in the U.S.
They have accounted for 80% of our new store development in recent years, and
that will continue. Those units deliver, as you would expect, higher average unit
volumes and superior operating margins, because of the higher volume, the
leverage that we get with that, with cash paybacks less than two years, substantially
better than we see in our traditional cafes, which are for more of a sit-and-stay
experience. This development will continue to be focused in geographies where
Starbucks penetration is relatively low.
So the Southeast and Central regions of the country.
So that will continue irrespective of what we're doing in dense urban markets.
In the dense urban markets where we're looking to accelerate the pace of Starbucks
pickup store development, that's less about growth near term. It's more about
transforming those trade areas near term and to set them up for future growth.
How they compare to cafes, a more eﬃcient asset, likely to be lower sales but a
much more attractive margin proﬁle with lower labor expense and lower occupancy
costs.
So we would expect returns on those investments, even with lower sales volumes, to
be at least as good as our traditional cafes, which have been good, not the same as
drive-throughs, and we expect that those will improve over time.
The drive-throughs are positioned as a unit growth engine for Starbucks. Again, the
pickup stores serving more as a vehicle to transform our dense urban markets,
eﬀectively to optimize our sales capture and improve proﬁtability of those
businesses, which are fairly well-established trade areas as opposed to drive-
throughs, which are more new trade areas for us.
I would say, particularly in the current environment where we're seeing customer
behavior shift, including more people working from home, perhaps for an extended
period of time, drive-through development in suburban markets remains a priority
for us.
Blending the pickup stores with traditional Starbucks stores in the dense urban
markets will elevate the customer experience and, as I mentioned before, position
Starbucks for long-term growth and as part of our strategy to transform those trade
areas.
So diﬀerent growth vehicles that we're going to be deploying diﬀerently depending
on what the needs are and what the opportunities are in the various markets, but weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-17
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 13A - David Palmer
A - Patrick Grismerbelieve collectively will enhance overall returns and improve proﬁtability while laying
a stronger foundation for future growth.
{BIO 6061984 <GO>}
That's great, and certainly seems logical, too, with the way America's moving these
days. I want to circle over to how you might be helping along the recovery in some
of your traditional stores. The U.S. being down 32% the last week of May. It seems
that most of this was due to people not ordering in your stores that -- whether it's in
the drive-throughs or the traditional cafes, ordering at the counter.
I guess that's a blend of social distancing and closed walk-in stores. You mentioned
9% were still closed at the time, and that lost urban commuter. How do you think
about getting each of those types of lost occasions back or replacing that with
something else? And how do you speciﬁcally see states reopening as a boost to your
stores that are already open?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well there's no doubt that as states reopen, we are able to introduce more channels
at each store, which eﬀectively increases our sales potential.
So think about it in progressive terms.
We move from drive-through and delivery only to entry way pickup with mobile
ordering, to curbside delivery where it's available, where we can provide it, to in-
store ordering and pickup, all the way to in-store seating.
So it's a progression. Each expansion or extension of service, each extra channel that
we have increases our capacity to accommodate customer demand and contributes
to sales recovery.
We've developed data-driven tools that each store manager can use to determine
based on prevailing conditions in their market, in their trade area how they can work
their way along that curve. And we're seeing that continue to unfold in the U.S. As we
mentioned in our 8-K, we saw nice progression from week-to-week as we undertook
a massive reopening in the U.S.
We've seen that continue into the month of June as, again, we progressively opened
these channels of distribution, eﬀectively increasing our capacity to accommodate
considerable customer demand, because you, yourself may have experienced this or
you read about it or saw it on the news, but when we were largely limited to drive-
through and some amount of delivery, we had very long lines.
We had more demand than we could accommodate.
So it also remains a priority for us to increase our operating eﬃciency, to increase
throughput at the drive-through, but critically important is opening up these otherFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-17
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 10 of 13A - David Palmer
A - Patrick Grismerchannels so we can better accommodate all of the demand, and that includes what I
mentioned earlier, and you kind of alluded to in your question, which is replacement
occasions.
We are seeing customers make shifts moving occasions to a diﬀerent location closer
to home as opposed to closer to the oﬃce, maybe later in the day.
So as their routines are evolving given the strong loyalty that we enjoy as a brand
and some of those established habits that have built over a period of years, we're --
our goal is to make the changes necessary to our operations, backed by marketing
to ensure that we are capturing that demand as we rebuild our business.
{BIO 6061984 <GO>}
One of the things you mentioned on the last earnings call was how marketing had
been turned oﬀ, and actually customer awareness at that point, it was a while ago,
but customer awareness that you were -- where you were open was low -- that you
were open. Could you talk about the marketing side and the building of awareness
and where you stand right now?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
The marketing has been absolutely instrumental to the progress that we've seen in
sales week-on-week. As you mentioned, we closed a lot of stores for an extended
period of time.
We only had 45% to 50% of our stores open in the U.S. for a period of about six
weeks, and we did that for reasons of partner safety and customer safety.
So as we started to reopen large numbers of stores in the second week of May, ﬁrst
of all, communicating that we were open was a priority.
We do expect by the end of our ﬁscal year to have substantially all of our stores
open. As of our 8-K last week, we had about 95% open.
So the remaining 5% we expect will open balance of year.
But after having been dark with our marketing activity for that period of six weeks,
we launched a holistic marketing campaign to ﬁrst drive awareness, but then right
behind that, drive traﬃc as we reopen some of these stores. And that included
traditional advertising. It included social media outreach, exterior signage, which
you've probably seen, and then targeted promotions to our Starbucks Rewards
members.
We also timed the ﬁrst phase of our summer program launch with this marketing
campaign, driving product news around, as I mentioned before, the coconut milk-
based beverages that have resonated so well with customers, particularly this time ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-17
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 11 of 13A - David Palmer
A - Patrick Grismerthe year, and then also rewarding customers for new app downloads and for
frequency.
So strategically using our Starbucks Rewards program to drive higher levels of
membership and more customer engagement through a personalized marketing.
Consumers have responded really well to these oﬀers.
And then for customers who habitually visited a speciﬁc store, they're starting to
return. And importantly, the Starbucks Rewards member base is continuing to
reengage at higher rates than the nonmembers. Their spend is holding to pre-
COVID-19 levels, and Starbucks Rewards contribution to U.S. company-operated
tender in the last week of May was at 48%, which is up from 44% in the second
quarter of our ﬁscal year.
So we're seeing an increase there. And as I mentioned before, driving membership
to Starbucks Rewards is a priority for us because of what that does to increase spend
through the combination of both increased visitation and increased average ticket.
{BIO 6061984 <GO>}
Thank you. Those are great data points. I'm just going to wrap things up. It's -- we've
been speeding along here, and so we only have time for one more.
But let's wrap things up with a question on China. It's -- that market's obviously been
earlier on the recovery and relatively aggressive in handling the issues there. You
noted that same-store sales in that market could reach near ﬂat levels by the end of
ﬁscal 4Q. Is China just simply earlier than the U.S.? Or is the recovery in other ways
fundamentally diﬀerent than the U.S., including potentially lingering eﬀects, positive
and negative?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well it's both earlier and diﬀerent.
I would also say we could not be more pleased with the steady progress we've seen
in China as the business has been recovering. The ﬁrst step for us was to rapidly
reopen stores.
We were closed for a shorter period than in the U.S.
We had widespread closures for about three weeks as opposed to six weeks, and
then we rapidly reopened stores. And then the playbook in China, very similar to the
playbook in the U.S. In fact, arguably, the U.S. has followed China, which is about not
only reopening stores rapidly, but then also coming behind that with marketing
support to drive high levels of awareness and to drive visitation into the stores,
leaning in on our digital assets with our Mobile Order & Pay and mobile order for
delivery platform in China as well as product news, which focused on what we call
the good, good platform, plant-based proteins and plant-based milk beverages.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-17

A - Patrick Grismer
A - David PalmerWe've seen changes in customer behavior as we've continued to recover the
business to remain fairly sticky with sustained high levels of Mobile Order & Pay and
mobile order for delivery compared to pre-COVID-19 levels.
We have seen some variability across the portfolio, as you would expect, related
more to diﬀerences in the proﬁle of the customer base in various markets.
But overall, the market has progressed well.
So I guess the last thing I would say is that the manner in which the country dealt
with the crisis was also very diﬀerent from the U.S. and I think contributed to the
speed with which the China business recovered in terms of a more coordinated
eﬀort by the country to mitigate and contain the virus and then to mobilize resources
to support the reopening of the economy.
I think that has also helped the China recovery and contributes to our belief that the
business will be substantially recovered by the end of this year with comps trending
to about ﬂat.
