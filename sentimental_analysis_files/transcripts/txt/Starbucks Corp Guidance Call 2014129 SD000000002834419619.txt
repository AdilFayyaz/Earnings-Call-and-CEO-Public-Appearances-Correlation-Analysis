Good afternoon. My name is Mike. I will be your conference operator today. At this
time, I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coﬀee Company's conference
call. (Operator Instructions)
Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.
{BIO 2134543 <GO>}
Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of
Investor Relations for Starbucks Coﬀee Company. Joining me today are Howard
Schultz, Chairman, President. And CEO; Troy Alstead, Chief Financial Oﬃcer and
Group President, Global Business Services; and Scott Maw, Senior Vice President,
Finance.
As you know, this afternoon we announced a new senior leadership structure,
eﬀective February 3. The intent of this call is to discuss that with you and give you an
opportunity to ask questions. So we appreciate you joining us on relatively short
notice.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-29

over to Howard Schultz.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Joann, thank you very much. As Joann said, thank you all for joining the call on such
short notice. I think the press release pretty much speaks for itself. And it is fairly
straightforward. But let me put into my own words what I think this is really about so
there's no misunderstanding.
First and foremost, it's really about strengthening our organization with proven
leaders who are heavily tenured and really understand the nuances of our business,
against our core business. And as we spoke last week on our conference call, that
core business, mainly our stores domestically and globally, will accelerate over time.
This new organization will bring a new level of discipline, business acumen. And
oversight to the business as we accelerate the growth of our retail footprint around
the world. That's number one.
Number two, to signiﬁcantly leverage the undervalued unparalleled physical and
digital assets that Starbucks has to create both new revenue streams and to ensure
relevancy of the brand inside and outside of our stores. Those are the two main core
issues beyond the restructuring of the organization.
What it is not about is it's not about succession planning. And it is deﬁnitely not
about me leaving or planning to leave the Company. It's not about taking our eye oﬀ
our core business; and in fact this organization is now put in place to both
strengthen and accelerate our core business.
It's not about any acquisition, certainly not anything that is in sight. And it's not about
slowing growth. Let me brieﬂy highlight to you the moves that we're making today
with speciﬁcity with regards to the organization.
In partnership with our senior leadership team, including Starbucks Chief Digital
Oﬃcer, Adam Brotman. And Chief Strategy Oﬃcer, Matt Ryan, I will expand my day-
to-day focus on all things innovation, including coﬀee and tea. But with an emphasis
on the Starbucks experience that will really thread into all things digital: digital
payments, areas of digital, mobile card, loyalty. And e-commerce.
I think I spoke at length last week about the seismic shift in consumer behavior. That
was not a December anomaly; that's going to happen and happen quickly. And we
believe strongly that any and all bricks-and-mortar retailers must understand and
must embrace this. And we are sitting with a set of assets that is unparalleled.
The investments have been made. And now we're going to ladder that up in ways
that I think will add signiﬁcant value, not only to a new stream of revenue. But inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-29

business, as we leverage the ﬂywheel of Starbucks. I will also continue to work
closely with our senior leadership team to continue to drive disciplined growth and
operational excellence around the world, while ensuring that our next wave of
growth is achieved through demonstration of our mission and values.
With regard to Troy, ﬁrst and foremost let me personally congratulate Troy on the
promotion of Chief Operating Oﬃcer. With my focus on the next wave of global
growth, it is my pleasure to announce the promotion of Starbucks Chief Financial
Oﬃcer, Troy Alstead, to the newly created position of Chief Operating Oﬃcer.
The addition of a COO will provide me with more time to focus on innovation and
strategic initiatives, while at the same time enable us to continue sharpening our
day-to-day operational focus and elevating Starbucks' unique customer experience.
In his new role, Troy will continue to report to me. And will be responsible for
aligning and prioritizing Company investments across business units.
The group presidents, Cliﬀ Burrows, who leads the US, Americas. And Teavana. And
John Culver, who will lead China Asia Paciﬁc, Channel Development. And Emerging
Brands, will now report to Troy, along with EMEA president, Kris Engskov. The
Company's new CFO, who I will discuss next, will also report to Troy, as well as his
existing senior direct reports, who lead the Company's global technology and global
supply chain organizations.
I couldn't be more grateful of and proud of Troy for his signiﬁcant contribution to
Starbucks over the past 22 years. And I look forward to working with him for many
more. I would also like to thank Cliﬀ and John for all they've done to make Starbucks
record FY13 and Q1 possible. I look forward to continue partnering with John and
Cliﬀ as trusted members of our senior leadership team.
With regard to our CFO, I would like to formally welcome and congratulate Scott
Maw. With Troy's appointment to COO, I'm pleased to share with you that Scott Maw,
Starbucks' Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, has been promoted to
Executive Vice President and CFO. Scott joined Starbucks as Global Controller in
2011. And brings more than two decades of ﬁnance leadership experience to this
new role, including senior ﬁnance leadership roles with JP Morgan Chase and GE.
And ﬁnally, it gives me great pride to announce Craig Russell's promotion to
Executive Vice President of Global Coﬀee. Craig has been in a Starbucks department
since 2001. And has embraced his role as Starbucks' voice and advocate for coﬀee
with passion, imagination. And humility.
The elevation of these strong, experienced Starbucks leaders will bring an even
greater ﬁnancial and operational discipline to our day-to-day business in our three
regions around the world. And I would say personally there's never been a greater
opportunity for Starbucks to signiﬁcantly grow, expand our business. And to do it inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-29

Page 4 of 12Troy Alsteadthe style and the elegance that we have in the past. And that is driving performance
through the lens of humanity.
We are on the cusp of another great inﬂection point in Starbucks' journey. I couldn't
be more optimistic about the Company's readiness to beneﬁt from the converging
retail, digital. And team environment.
Simply put, there's never been a more exciting, a more important time to be a
Starbucks' customer, Starbucks partner, or Starbucks' shareholder. With that, it gives
me great pride and admiration and respect to give the call over to Troy.
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Thank you, Howard. First let me say that I had the chance to work with many of you
who are calling into the call today over the past ﬁve-plus years. And I want to take
the opportunity to thank you all for the support you've given me and to Starbucks
during my time as CFO. It really is an immense honor to be given the opportunity to
lead the day-to-day operations at Starbucks after more than two decades with the
Company.
When I joined Starbucks it was a small, privately-held company of stores, primarily in
the northwest, with high aspirations and goals. And of course, now it is a global
growth company.
I've had the privilege of working closely with Howard and the business unit leaders
over many years. And I couldn't be more proud of what we've achieved, nor more
conﬁdent in the opportunities ahead. It's no secret that one of Howard's great
strengths, among many, is that of a visionary and strategic thinker.
Providing him the opportunity to focus even more sharply on innovation and
Starbucks' strategic initiatives while I take on daily oversight of our global operations
will allow us to realize our growth ambitions more quickly. Howard and I have a great
trust between us and a great working relationship. We share a passion for what
Starbucks stands for. And a commitment to our partners and to the values that have
made Starbucks really what it is today.
I've also had the great opportunity to work closely for many years with our strong
business leaders in Cliﬀ Burrows, John Culver. And Kris Engskov leading our
operations around the world. I now look forward in this new role to working directly
with them to align and prioritize strategies and investments to ensure we as a
Company deliver the discipline, growth. And operational and ﬁnancial excellent that
we're committed to.
Let me now speak a bit further about our new Chief Financial Oﬃcer, Scott Maw, who
I recruited into Starbucks a few years ago as a key leader in the ﬁnance organization.
During that time, Scott and I have worked very closely together as he has gradually
assumed more and more of the ﬁnance function. And has taken on increasinglyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-29

Q - Sara Senatoremore responsibility, making a signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁnance organization and the
Company as a whole.
In addition to the impact he's made in his time here, Scott brings depth and
experience from a number of previous CFO and ﬁnance leadership roles in other
companies. Many of you have had the opportunity to meet Scott in the past couple
of years when he has joined me on road shows or at meetings here in Seattle. For
those of you who have met him, I know you experienced ﬁrsthand his deep
knowledge and understanding of the business.
Howard, the Board. And I are highly conﬁdent of Scott's capabilities to be a fantastic
next CFO for Starbucks. Scott and I will work closely together as I transition into my
new role and Scott into his.
We will be meeting with the ﬁnancial community together over the next few months.
And for those of you who haven't met Scott already, I look forward to introducing
him to you in person. I'll now turn the call over to Scott for a few comments. Scott?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Thanks Troy. First of all, let me say I'm very honored and humbled to serve as the
CFO of Starbucks. I've long admired Starbucks' ﬁnancial achievements that combine
rapid growth, world-class innovation. And return on investment at a scale few others
can match.
Over the past few years, I have learned much more about what makes Starbucks a
very successful and very diﬀerent kind of Company. Even more unique than our
ﬁnancial performance is the ability to achieve these results while leading the way as
a global citizen, via our deep commitment to environmental sustainability, the
communities we serve, our partners. And our customers.
I'm excited to join the leadership team and our partners around the world as we
continue to elevate the Starbucks experience. And I look forward to meeting many of
you and working with you in the future. With that, we'll turn the call back to the
operator to open the line for questions. Operator.
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions)
Your ﬁrst question comes from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-29
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 12A - Troy AlsteadGreat. Thank you very much. Troy, congratulations to you on this. It's been great
working with you. I look forward to continuing that. If I may, could you talk about --
you said the split with you and Howard will allow to you accelerate the growth going
forward. Can you talk speciﬁcally about what that means? Would we expect a step-
up very literally in investments? Is it more just about the focus? Can you just maybe
give us a little more detail on that?
And on a related note, could you talk explicitly about your growth in China? Howard
mentioned that on the conference call last week. And obviously there's been some
concern. So maybe how that ﬁts into accelerating growth?
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Thanks. First, Sara, thanks for your congratulations. I appreciate that. Let me speak to
this. One of the overarching goals of this org structure, as Howard said, is really to
focus a number of places. Him to focus in innovation and our initiatives by allowing
him to step up a little bit and hand oﬀ some of that daily oversight of the business to
me working and partnering very closely with the great teams we have around the
world and the leaders we have in Cliﬀ and John and then Kris, leading Europe for us.
One of the key goals of this is for us to build upon the great success we've had in
our operations around the world. And continually challenging ourselves to say, how
do we elevate that further? Where does this come next? How do we execute better
than ever before, both in terms of the experiences that we're providing the
customers, how we're leading our partners? And yes, the growth that we can drive
throughout the business.
If there's anything that we've learned in the last few years, it is that our global upside
is bigger than it's ever been before. We came out of the diﬃcult days of 2008 and
2009. And have continually ramped up our pace of development since then. And
concurrently ramped up volumes per store, proﬁtability per store, return on capital,
have every single year increased to new levels. And we believe we've got an
opportunity to pick up the pace of growth in the coming years in a very responsible,
disciplined way and continue elevating every metric we have, again, ﬁrst starting with
the customer. So that is a big part of what we're going in to for. I'm really conﬁdent
we can do that.
Speciﬁc to China. And I would just say I think that there's concerns you were
mentioning. I think that's more broadly about China, not about Starbucks. As we said
on the call last week, our results in China actually accelerated in this most recent
quarter. Traﬃc growth accelerated, two-year comp growth accelerated. Our
proﬁtability accelerated dramatically, far faster even than the top line, which was
pretty remarkable itself in China. So our goal there is to continue the fantastic
progress we have, continue working to build capabilities so we can responsibility
accelerate even further from here as we approach the coming years.
And by the way, look at opportunities outside of the Starbucks store to grow, not
unlike what we've done in other markets. Huge opportunity ahead. None of theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-29

A - Howard Schultzconcerns you may have heard others are in the least bit showing up in our business.
And I wouldn't expect them to.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
Thank you.
Your next question is from Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
{BIO 1491816 <GO>}
Thank you. This may be too simplistic. But is it fair for us to think about these moves
as entrusting the physical assets of the business to Troy while you, Howard, try to
further develop the digital opportunity? Is that a fair way to categorize the moves, or
is that too simplistic?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
I mean, I don't think I'd go that far. Troy's oﬃce and my oﬃce is about, I don't think
it's 15 yards apart. So every single day that we're in the oﬃce, we are talking about
the business holistically. And I see this continuing.
However, as Troy indicated in terms of the last question, this frees me up to really
focus, I think, on the assets that we have that we think are under-leveraged. When
you look at mobile payment and what we're able to do there. And you look at the
card and MSR and what we did during Q1, calendar Q1 with -- I'm sorry, calendar Q4
with 1.4 billion on the card, I think there are enormous opportunities for us to take
advantage of this. I think it's twofold. One is that unto themselves, we think these
assets can create new revenue streams and signiﬁcantly long-term proﬁt for us.
But in doing so, I think we can integrate them into the core retail business. And as a
result of that have a positive eﬀect on being able to drive more frequency and more
value for our customers. I think in the previous question in terms of growth, Troy
indicated also, I think there's opportunities in the long term to increase average unit
volumes. And I think by leveraging the digital assets we have and mobile payment
that we have, there are things that we can do around that and loyalty that we have
not done before.
We've learned a great deal most recently about what we're able to do in other
channels in distribution. We've processed over 2 million Starbucks' Stars that have
been processed as a result of people buying pounds of coﬀee in the grocery aisle.
That is another indication to us that there is a currency that relates to Stars that can
go further in the future. I think we're just beginning to understand that. If you just
take all of that and the seismic change, we are going to be on the right side of this to
date. And we believe we have the winning hand with assets that are signiﬁcantly
under-leveraged that are highly complementary to our core business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-29

Q - Matthew DiFrisco
A - Howard Schultz{BIO 1491816 <GO>}
Thank you. That's a good overview.
Your next question is from Matthew DiFrisco with Buckingham Research.
{BIO 3948570 <GO>}
Thank you. You actually answered a little bit of my question there. I was wondering
about that, about the cross-selling opportunity. I think it was a couple of conference
calls ago, maybe two, where you were mentioning the introduction of cross-selling
into not only the card and the loyalty, into the grocery channel as well. I guess is that
somewhat the opportunity that we could see, just not conﬁning the mobile payment
opportunity, or even the mobile app and your connection with your consumer
conﬁned to your stores. But is it a broader opportunity? Can you talk about that, what
channels they could be outside of the Starbucks store?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Let me try and answer that. And with the caveat that I want to ensure the fact that we
are not in any way over-promising what our capabilities are. But instead talking
about our aspiration and what might be possible. So let's make sure that my words
are not misunderstood.
As we sit today, processing almost 5 million mobile transaction -- payments a week,
we are so far ahead of any other national retailer of scale. I don't even if anyone is
processing 1 million payments a week. That has garnered the attention of leading
tech companies, all of whom are chasing with great fervor, who is going to be able
to create the standard de facto of mobile payments. What I will say is that I think
there are things that we can take advantage of. And that we can leverage, that are
outside of the ecosystems of Starbucks.
And this new organizational change will free me up to really create and innovate
around not only mobile payment. But the things that we are doing with new
channels of distribution in which we can cross-promote and cross-reward our
customers with Stars as currency. I think we're in the nascent stage of all this. But as
we sit down with leading companies in the space, what has become very clear to us
is that we have a set of unparalleled assets coupled with one of the most trusted
brands in the world.
That is a very valuable component of what ultimately will make up one or many
standards of mobile payment around the country. And I think this organizational
change is a signiﬁcant pivot point that is designed to strengthen our core business at
a time when we have the wind at our back. And take advantage of the investments
we've made. And leveraging the equity of the brand and the -- what we believe to
be the convergence of the consumer integrating their lifestyle and their shoppingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-29

going to be at the cutting edge of that.
{BIO 3948570 <GO>}
Okay. I have a follow-up question, if I could just ask on that. That was very good.
Thank you for that answer.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Go ahead.
{BIO 3948570 <GO>}
With respect to, I guess, if you think 10 years ago, you guys always used to not
market. You used to say your real estate was key. I guess, do you see the young
consumer and the future consumer, the incremental guy that you're gaining coming
into the workforce, is digital the future of real estate? I mean, is that how people are -
- is digital and the way you are going to pay become -- are you seeing trends
become more increasingly more component to why I choose the place I'm going to
buy at, rather than what real estate might have been 10 to 20 years ago?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
I think that's a fascinating question. I think if we look at the assets that we have as a
Company, I think the strongest critic would be hard-pressed to say that Starbucks
probably has the best real estate portfolio of any national footprint company in
America. And when you look at the fact that the majority of our stores are Company-
owned, we have the nimbleness and the ﬂexibility to do things outside of our stores
that a typically franchise system does not, because of the inherent conﬂicts and
cannibalization.
Having said that, our core real estate will always be a major asset of the Company.
However, there's no question that the consumer is rapidly embracing and involved in
-- and it's evolving to the point when your digital wallet is going to be the primary
currency of how you're going to pay for things.
But if you look at the assets of Starbucks going forward, the national footprint of our
stores, the equity of the brand. And the ability to integrate these digital and mobile
assets into the shopping experience and create relevancy. And I think that is the
operative word here. The consumer brand that's going to win over the long term is
going to be relevant not only inside the four walls of their respective store. But a
must-have is to be relevant in the digital space in which the customer is not only
living, working. And playing. But in every aspect of their life.
I think we are in a very unique position, unlike most traditional bricks-and-mortar
companies. And a very unique position against most digitally-based consumer
brands who do not have a physical presence. When you combine those two things,
in a seamless fashion for the customer, we have an opportunity, I think, to do things
that will leverage both asset classes unto themselves and make them stronger as aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-29

{BIO 6061984 <GO>}
Hi, guys. Congratulations Troy and Scott. Howard, I wonder if this arrangement in
some way brings you back to the structure of the days when Orin was working with
you. Is that -- do you feel like this is analogous where -- and I'm sorry for saying this.
But if Troy is the Orin here and that this (technical diﬃculty) frees you [ph] perhaps to
have more fun on the innovation side, much like the old days? Is that similar to that
deal?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
I tend not to look back on the old days. So many people at Starbucks say -- I'm so
fond of the old days. But they don't remember, I was here during those days and
they weren't that good. (inaudible). Let me say this. Of course, my working
relationship and respect for Orin is above reproach. But Troy and I have worked for
22 years. That's a very unusual relationship and partnership. We probably can ﬁnish
each other's sentences with regard to the business. Troy will bring a level of business
acumen and discipline to the business through the lens of his experience and his
skill base that I believe will make us stronger at a time when we are moving at a very
rapid global pace. And his working relationship with John, Cliﬀ. And Kris is so strong
and his respect within the organization.
At the same token, I'm not leaving the business on any level. I'm still engaged in the
meetings, I'm still engaged in the strategy. These people will report to Troy. And Troy
will develop his own team and his own rhythm with that team. Troy and I, we talk
every single day, whether we're in the oﬃce or not, about the business, the
challenges, the opportunities. And that's not going to change.
What will change. And I keep repeating myself, is that we believe we can go after
something that is rare. That is a signiﬁcant unparalleled, under-leveraged digital
assets that we have that relate to mobile, mobile payment and other things that we
believe we can bring to the market that will make both our digital and our physical
business stronger. Troy is a great partner. His relationship with Scott also will bring us
closer together. I just think our team is a seamless team. No one is walking around
thinking, who's reporting to who? It just doesn't work like that at Starbucks. This is aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-29

Thank you.
Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
Thanks. Since this [ph] has been acquisitive recently. You've bought a number of
brands than have enhanced the Starbucks business. In your new role, do you think
acquisitions play a piece in this new digital strategy?
And secondarily, do you think there is opportunity to create new revenue streams for
the Company? I'm thinking speciﬁcally would you choose to own, or potentially own,
or create digital payment platforms that you could then sell to third parties?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
As I said in my comments, what this is not about is that there's no short-term target
of any acquisition. And there's no company that we're thinking of acquiring.
However, I think the payments space itself is a very attractive opportunity for our
Company, given the digital assets that we have. And I think moving forward, we'll be
speaking more about that as time goes on.

Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess it's very clear at this point that Starbucks
has been open about investments in digital and mobile. And has been very
successful with those. It seems like e-commerce, though, is a word that's come up a
little bit more frequently recently. And Starbucks has had an online store for a long
time. And maybe if you could give us just some color on where you see a greater
opportunity there. And maybe how that might tie into better addressing the
international opportunity in CPG?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-29

I think our current product line, given the multiple channels of distribution that we
have, I mean, there are over 100,000 points of distribution in North America for
Starbucks coﬀee products. As a result of that, an opportunity within e-commerce on
our core products is fairly limited. I do think there are creative things that we can do
that leverages the physical assets we have that could become (technical diﬃculty) to
be honest with you, I think the e-commerce pure play opportunity, as it is probably
understood, is really subordinate to the opportunities that we see with regard to
loyalty card, mobile transactions. And ultimately the digital wallet and payments.
