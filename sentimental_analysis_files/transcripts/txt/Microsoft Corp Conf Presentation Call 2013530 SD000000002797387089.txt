Well. Good morning. Good morning. There we go. All right, it's great to be here and
it's great to be able to talk a little bit about the Microsoft story and what we are up to,
which I think is very timely. We have got a lot happening in our Company. There is a
lot happening certainly in the industry and having someone that has been in
technology and around technology for a very long time, I think this is one of the
most exciting times certainly that I have ever seen as it relates to the amount of
change, the velocity of change and the volume of change. So there is a lot to get to
and a lot to talk about. I am going to jump into it.
Before I do that, I want to say thank you to Mark and thank you to all of you for
allowing us the opportunity to come here. We appreciate the opportunity to be able
to bring you up to speed a little bit on our business and talk a little bit about context,
as well as hearing any questions or feedback you may have for us.
The Company is around a little over 37 years old and in tech terms, that is an old
company in some respects. In other respects, we are a very young company and we
have always been, at our core, a software company and Bill believed in the magic of
software and the possibilities of software and we long had this aspiration that he
crafted of having a PC on every desk and in every home. And that dream and
aspiration mostly has been fulﬁlled, particularly in mature markets. In emerging
markets, it is happening very rapidly.
The transition that we are on right now and the transformation that we are in the
middle of is around this idea of becoming a devices and services company. And it
doesn't mean we are going to make all the devices. But it does mean the way we
monetize, what is important to us changes from a device perspective. It also means
that we will make some of the devices that we are getting into some of the devices
area. And you saw us launch Surface and Surface Pro. We have long had Xbox and
we have long had some mice and keyboard and some other hardware elements. But
you saw us take a diﬀerent stance particularly of late as it relates to devices and
where we are going.
And it is a broad range of devices and we want to light up, still having software at the
core, great experiences across those devices. And to be able to do that, we believe
services is one of the big monetization levels and levers that we will use across
consumers and businesses. And we have been hard at work for a long, long time
candidly on our services business and we have not -- I wouldn't say we've been out
and evangelized and articulated what that story is from a services perspective. But
I'm here today, at least from a perspective of the enterprise really ground you in
what's going on in the services business at Microsoft and where are we. Because I
think this has been about, I would say, more than seven to eight years in the makingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-30
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 17and it is really maturing in a very nice way. And I will talk about that and get into that
in a moment.
So we have a very diverse and balanced business. This is not a chart you see from us
very often. But it is a chart that I like to use. I like to use for a couple of reasons. One,
we are really the only technology company out there seeking end-users and
consumers all the way up to the biggest customers and governments in the world.
And that is something, as you see this chart here, 53% of our business goes to
enterprise, 21% consumer and online and then we have an OEM number, which
certainly there is a lot of consumer in that particular segment as well. But that is how
we account for it. Then small and medium-sized businesses at 6%.
The other thing you can see here is from a product and services perspective and
anytime I talk about this, it blows people away. This chart used to look, a long, long
time ago, it was predominantly Windows, then Oﬃce, then everything else. As you
can see from this particular chart, Windows is now our third-biggest business and we
have a couple of other businesses ahead of Windows and I would say that we are
pretty proud of the diversity of this portfolio.
The Oﬃce division is not just the Oﬃce product. In fact, the last three record holders
in our Company in terms of speed to $1 billion from a product perspective live in this
particular segment of the chart -- Oﬃce, Exchange, SharePoint, Oﬃce 365. There are
some very big complementary products in that particular segment.
The server and tools business continues to explode and we continue to grow share.
You all see the share numbers. We are growing share, cross-virtualization,
hypervisors, systems management, database. Those areas, very, very healthy, now
make up 26% of our Company and continue to grow very nicely. Windows is still
25%, entertainment devices at 13% and Bing in the online area at 4%.
And if you look at the geographic basis, we count it -- the way we count it is really
North America, the US and Canada together, as well as rest of world. And I would tell
you that this chart continues to change and will continue to be more balanced from a
global perspective. But the business is very, very balanced and diverse. We operate
in 191 countries around the world and we have over 1.5 billion people that use our
products every day. So it is a very global company from that perspective. But
whether you slice it on customers, products and services or geographically, we
believe we have a very balanced business, which positions us well both in good
times and tough times.
Now if I would have been here at this conference a year ago on this day, I would've
said, ladies and gentlemen. we are right on the eve of the largest single innovation
plan portfolio rollout re-imagination in the history of our Company. We basically are
about to launch every single product solution and service in our portfolio in a 12-
month window.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-30
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 17I stand here today to tell you we did that. And it feels really, really good. And so we
launched and landed in market an unprecedented wave of innovation this past 12
months and something that we are going to continue to build on for the years to
come. And it has been very, very foundational for us as an organization.
Now when you think about the opportunity we have in the marketplace, we really
see four market-driven trends that I want to talk about and then I want to talk about
how we are answering those. And my speciﬁc pivot today will be around how we are
answering those in our commercial business, particularly with the enterprise and
business to business -- cloud, social, mobility and Big Data. There is no secrets there;
there is no surprises there. Those are very, very popular business themes that
customers are all seeking answers to, that our partner ecosystem is also seeking an
answer to and that is what we have been hard at work on as it relates to really
ginning up our business and our go-to-market to take advantage of those.
Let me jump into the cloud ﬁrst. When you look at the Microsoft cloud, I think the
ﬁrst thing you have to do is you have to have context that we have been in the cloud
a long time and we have been in the cloud speciﬁcally around consumer services for
a long time. And if you look at some of the momentum we have today with 400
million plus people using Outlook.com, formerly named Hotmail, 46 million people
subscribing to Xbox LIVE, 460 million MSN customers that use the product on a
regular basis. Skype has over 300 million active users that average 100 minutes a
month. And now we feel one-third of all long-distance traﬃc in the world, run
internationally, runs through this particular network.
SkyDrive, a relatively new and younger cloud service for us, now has over 250 million
users growing very, very rapidly. The strength that we have in these consumer cloud
services are serving us extremely well in our commercial cloud service. And that is
what I am going to pivot to. If you looked at our commercial cloud service business,
the fastest-growing product in the history of Microsoft to $1 billion, ﬁrst was
Windows; second was Oﬃce; third came SharePoint. I will talk about SharePoint in a
moment. But this year that we are in, Oﬃce 365 became the fastest-growing product
in the history of Microsoft to $1 billion. We are growing our seats 5 times what we
were year-over-year and this is a business that is exploding and accelerating across
all segments and it is one that we feel very, very good about.
We have also been very active and hard at work in signing up some of the most
important and sophisticated customers around the world and that is government
and we have got a lot of government momentum, including here in the US. But
going outside the US into Canada, India, Australia, the UK, France, Germany,
Switzerland, Mexico. We have got some very big lighthouse wins that we are winning
in government in taking that to business in a very strategic way.
We feel like when you see our cloud solutions that we have got the most enterprise-
grade and enterprise-credible cloud out there speciﬁcally around productivity. And
50% of the Fortune 500 are already actively using our platform and infrastructure as
a service with Azure. So we have got some real momentum that is manifesting itselfFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-30
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 17into real numbers in the business cloud space and it is one that again we feel pretty
good about.
So let me take you through some detail here about what are you doing in the
business cloud services, what do you oﬀer the enterprise customer, what are they
buying because I think this is really important for you to have context around. We
have three distinct types of cloud. We have a private cloud environment and that
includes hosted, hosted by a partner and it also includes customer-hosted. So we
have a great private cloud environment. We have a public cloud environment with
our own cloud and speciﬁcally Windows Azure where we run the majority of
everything we have in our public cloud on Azure and then we have probably the
most popular cloud that we oﬀer is the hybrid cloud. It makes a very unique story
about our cloud situation and other people. We are not trying to push people to our
cloud; we are trying to build the cloud on customer terms. We take customers to the
cloud at their pace. And so we oﬀer both behind the ﬁrewall and outside the ﬁrewall
cloud environments.
And when you think about it, let me talk about private cloud for a moment because
this is an area again that has really changed over the last three years. We got a little
bit of a late start as it relates to virtualization. We are now in a situation where we are
(inaudible) very, very strong market share, we are growing every quarter and the
dominant guy is losing every quarter as it relates to virtualization. And the game all
changed when we launched Windows Server 2012. When we put Windows Server
2012 in market, we have a superior piece of technology all across the technology
measurements and metrics that people check. And we are a third the price of the
other guy. So the share momentum that we have in this private cloud space is all
driven oﬀ of a better product and a better price.
When you get a better product and a better price, I tell our own team you better
grow share. And that is precisely what we have been doing quarter after quarter after
quarter in this particular space and we are growing at twice the rate of the other guy.
And as I said, every quarter, as the share numbers come out, we go up, they go
down. And that is something that again we like to see from a market share
perspective.
When you look at the public cloud environment, you have to think about it in terms
of three diﬀerent distinct types of services that we oﬀer. One is productivity and
collaboration. I talked about the success of Oﬃce 365, Yammer, Skype, SharePoint,
Lync and Exchange also fall in that particular space. So we have got a uniﬁed
communications cloud, a collaboration cloud, a productivity cloud and the ability to
host those services publicly or privately for people as they so choose.
In the business solution area, on our dynamics platform, again, we have both on-
premise, as well as CRM online and ERP online, something we are very excited about
for our dynamics portfolio.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-30
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 17In the infrastructure and platform as a service, it is all about Azure, Windows Azure
and SQL Azure. And we started with a really forward-looking transformational
approach as it relates to platform as a service. We really stepped out there and took
that platform as a service head on and delivered that with Azure. Then we came back
recently and added our infrastructure as a service. So the most forward-looking of all
of the clouds that we have is Azure from a platform as a service perspective. And we
have some very big customer wins and important customer wins in that space that
we are also very proud of.
Now one of the strategic advantages we have in our portfolio is the ability to have
common identity, the virtualization, common management, as well as a common
development environment. If a customer has Active Directory and System Center
completely deployed, we have the ability to take them to the cloud whenever they
so choose and the ability to have that done where they can have a single sign-on,
sign in and they don't care whether the data is hosted in the public cloud, the private
cloud or the hybrid cloud, they have unique provisioning and identity management
with our platform and with our solutions.
And think about it. The majority of our customers have Active Directory and System
Center. So we have a really powerful ﬂywheel, if you will, to continue to gain
momentum in the enterprise cloud space. And we think we are very well-positioned.
This is not a three-year roadmap. This is what I am selling today in markets. This is
what is driving our enterprise business in a big way. The Microsoft enterprise-grade
cloud, we have spent a long time working very hard on making sure that we really
put the investments in building this cloud out the right way. We have got globally
redundant data centers in all the important geographic theaters around the world.
We have both secondaries and primaries. We have got massive networks built to
work on latency in places like Australia and South Africa and other hard-to-get to
places. We have got a whole bunch of advancing compliance and regulatory
initiatives underway.
This is one of the hardest areas because the compliance and regulatory environment
from a cloud service perspective changes very, very rapidly and it is diﬀerent by
geography around the world. Even within Europe, yes, they have the EU model
cloud. But even within Europe, the diﬀerent countries have diﬀerent requirements as
it relates to data sovereignty, data protection, data privacy and what we do with the
cloud.
One of the things I am most proud of here is we just launched last week a cloud in
China. We have the ﬁrst commercial and enterprise-grade cloud. We have a partner
there in China that we just launched and kicked oﬀ last week. And we are very
excited about the potential in China for a lot of reasons. One, for monetization
reasons. There is no piracy in the cloud. The cloud is a beautiful thing from that
perspective.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-30
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 17The other thing that the cloud does is it allows people to stay current. One of our
biggest problems is a lot of people have our product solutions and services. But they
are running old versions. In the cloud, we take care of that for them.
The third thing the cloud does is when you sell in the cloud, you now have
someone's mission-critical environment that you are taking care of and looking after.
So it gives you -- what we have seen is it gives you a unique perspective to be able
to grow your share of wallet with that customer. Microsoft still has a relatively low
share of wallet on enterprise spend because we are software, not hardware, in the
enterprise. And when you think about our potential to grow that share of wallet, we
see it coming from the reliance on cloud services. Getting people on our cloud
services is great for us on being able to keep them current, keep them patched,
allow them to experience the latest and greatest functionality, all the diﬀerent things
that go along with that.
I will talk about security in a moment. But it is an important area in growing of
importance for everybody globally and those companies not working on it should
be. That is how strongly we feel about it. And we know that the cloud saves people
money. The ability not to have to procure data center space, run power, run ﬁber, get
gear, bring it up, all those things are now put on somebody who has scale. And
certainly from a Microsoft data center perspective, we have a lot of scale.
Now I get asked a lot about security and again, I am somebody who has been in IT
and around IT for a very long time. One of the things that I like to do each year is I
look at this report, it's a third-party report, it is put out by a company called Secunia
and you can look it up online. But one of the unique things about this report. And I
study it every year, is it tracks the number of vulnerabilities that are out in the
marketplace from the top software and technology ﬁrms.
This past year, the non-Microsoft vulnerabilities accounted for 86% of the
vulnerabilities in the most popular programs. When you look at that, that is a chart
that has really changed over the year and one of the things that I think is pretty cool
when you think about it is this idea of having the top companies and their
vulnerabilities. So if you looked this past year, in the past 12 months, which company
would you say had the most vulnerability? Well it was Google. Who had the second
most? It is Apple. Who had the third most? It is Adobe. Then it is Mozilla and then it is
Microsoft.
This is a chart, ladies and gentlemen. that is quite profound and interesting on a
couple of dimensions. One, our global footprint relative to the other four guys is
signiﬁcantly larger if you added all of them up by a multiple. So we have a lot bigger
market share and a lot more potential chance for exposure than the other guys. The
reality is we had fewer vulnerabilities than the other guys.
Now this is no accident or mistake. We have been investing in security and the
importance of trustworthy computing for many, many years, more than 13 years. As
an organization, we have been investing in that initiative. A part of that you could sayFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-30
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 17is out of necessity. Whatever it is, we have got a big head start in this particular space
and we only see the cyber security areas continuing to escalate, continuing to
elevate as it relates to the importance of what is happening out there.
We are not satisﬁed or happy with 131 vulnerabilities over the last 12 months.
Precisely the opposite. We want to drive that number down further and further and
further. But we are really the only company out there doing that. Everybody else is
going the other way and we are continuing to go the other way. And we are going to
continue to go in opposite directions on that and invest in what we think is a very,
very important area.
Now the other area about the cloud that we get asked a lot about is what about
Oﬃce, what is going to happen to Oﬃce as it relates to this cloud and where things
go there. Well the new release of Oﬃce is a cloud service. It has got the full Oﬃce
apps available in the cloud and oﬀ-line. It is always up-to-date as it relates to the
cloud with features and what we are able to drive there from a product and product
performance standpoint. And it allows you to sign in to any device and your
documents, your spreadsheets, your Word documents, your OneNote can roam with
you regardless of what device you use. It is per user now across Windows, tablets,
PCs and Macs and that ability to see the side-by-side installation of the old version
and the new version we think has been very, very helpful in helping this product get
embraced. And so we are pretty excited about this new Oﬃce and where we have
gone as a cloud service and it has been very well-received by our customers.
Let me talk about the next big megatrend that we are embracing and it is social. And
it is speciﬁcally enterprise social. Now you know the success of SharePoint. It was the
fastest-growing product in the history of the Company to $1 billion after Oﬃce. And
we have had wild success with SharePoint the product. It became the Facebook, if
you will, of the enterprise. In fact, over 85% of the companies in the Fortune 500 use
it and more than that use it in the Fortune 2,000. When you look at where we have
taken that particular platform, we have broadened it and this new release of
SharePoint is an exciting one and I will touch on that in a moment.
We bought a company a while back called Yammer, which has very good
penetration, again, allowing for collaboration, group feeds and technology and
information sharing in the Yammer product and we like where we are -- we are pretty
well-positioned in this space. And if you look at what has happened, we are seeing
great increases in the Yammer product and portfolio and those continue to sustain
and accelerate as we integrate that product into SharePoint and into our
collaboration and productivity story.
We have got strong penetration with our uniﬁed communications solution called
Lync. Yesterday, we announced something very strategic in this space. We
announced Lync to Skype integration. So the ability to do presence, sharing, voice
calls from Lync to Skype, Skype to Lync, B2C, C2B communication exists now on the
platform. Very, very strategic for us again from a social and collaboration
perspective.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-30
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 17When you think about it, this enterprise social space is a hot space. It was really
borne of the idea that most enterprises want to get people to work better together
behind the ﬁrewall and that is why SharePoint was so wildly successful. The new
version, the contemporary version of enterprise social says, hey, that is important.
But I also want to make sure I collaborate and work well outside the ﬁrewall. I want to
extend deeper into my customers and into my partners.
The new release of SharePoint does something very unique. Within that release of
SharePoint that we just launched, we now have hooks built in for Facebook
integration, Twitter, LinkedIn, the ability for a company to take those external data
feeds, run those through the system using our CRM product, using all of our
collaboration tools, SharePoint, the new release of Oﬃce, the new release of
Exchange and what we do with Lync and Skype and bring a whole new powerful
experience on enterprise social to the table.
This is a hot area. This is an area that most every company will give you a seat at the
table to understand how can you help me get in front of this social phenomenon
that is happening to companies. Everybody wants to connect outside the ﬁrewall
now in addition to inside the ﬁrewall. And we believe with these latest and greatest
solutions and the integration of Yammer, we have got a very, very uniquely
positioned product to take advantage of that. So I look for this business to be of
growing importance long term and we are going to drive that very hard in our
commercial business.
Next, let me talk about mobility. There is no secret it is a mobile ﬁrst world that we
are moving to around. And we have been hard at work on the mobile story. We've
still got a lot of work to do to continue to grow our mobile business. But one of the
things we are proud of is we are making traction, we are making traction in the
mobile space. It starts with the quality of the OS.
For the ﬁrst time in external surveys. And this one was done by PC Magazine
recently, we are now ranking ahead of iOS. We have been ahead of Android for a
while. We are now ahead of iOS as it relates to customer satisfaction and readers'
choice. That has never happened on our platform before. It is happening now. And
so we feel very good about Windows Phone 8 and what we have been able to do
there.
As a result of that, we are seeing some market pickup. We are growing at 5 times the
smartphone market rate right now worldwide and globally, 5 times. And we have
become the number three phone OS. We still have a long, long way to go in this
space. But we are seeing positive momentum, positive traction. We have got
countries like Mexico, Italy, Poland, Spain and others, Portugal, where we have really
big share in these countries with the phone OS and we are going to continue to
bring that out more and more globally and again, continue to grow share in this
space.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-30
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 17When you think about the mobile ecosystem for Microsoft though, it is broader than
just phone. The new Windows 8 platform gives us the opportunity with our
technology to really explode the mobile ecosystem into new form factors, into
detachables, into wearables, into convertibles, into two-and-one, into all kinds of
tablets, slates, embedded devices, point-of-sale registers, ATM machines, kiosks. We
are bringing this particular OS and what we are able to do uniquely across this entire
ecosystem and spectrum.
And we have got some pretty unique technologies like SmartGlass, which now oﬀer
the ability for you to watch a movie on any device on your phone, pause it, resume it
on your tablet or your slate from the same location, pause it and resume it and ﬁnish
watching it from the same location on your TV, all with consistent motions across our
platform. And that is something again -- this mobile ecosystem is something that we
are nurturing to continue to grow. We see it as a very, very important area for us to
continue to invest in.
Now one area that we continue to work on is this area of mobile and oﬃce and
productivity across the mobile devices. We not only have the best productivity
experience on the Windows mobile platform. We now oﬀer it available through Web
apps on iOS and Android as well. So the ability for them to get those Web apps on
those platforms is something that we are pretty excited about again with this new
release of Oﬃce. We oﬀer the same ﬁdelity, viewing and editing capabilities in the
cloud across all platforms and it is something that we are going to continue to
nurture as well.
The second area that we are really helping enterprises is in the area of management.
Every company is struggling with how do I get my arms around this, bring your own
device to work, all these new diﬀerent devices showing up in the workplace. The
new release of System Center not only manages our devices, it also helps you
manage the other guys' devices. We now manage iOS and Android devices as well
on our systems management platform. Again, this is something that enterprises are
really seeking and looking for us to help them drive and explode that particular
trend.
Another trend is Big Data. No secret with the cloud, with mobile devices and smart
devices, the proliferation of social, there is a big, big demand on Big Data, Big Data,
BI analytics. What is the Microsoft position in this particular space? Well let me give
you a couple of notes that you may not know about our platform. Our SQL premium
oﬀering is growing at over 20% and that is a consistent growth rate that we are
continuing to drive on that platform. We lead benchmarks like TPC-E now. We are
being able to get energy and eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness from a database. We are at
the top of those TPC-E benchmarks. SQL is growing double digit all up from a
revenue growth perspective in the last quarter and that has been a consistent trend
for us. Excel certainly is the most widely used BI tool and will continue to be. We
don't see that changing in the foreseeable future. And SQL Server is now the most
widely deployed database in the world by far.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-30
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 17So when you look at all the databases out there, the number one deployed database
in the world is now SQL Server. We have been growing share in that SQL business
quarter after quarter after quarter. Why? Because we have a really good product and
we have a better value proposition. When you bring those two things to the market,
you can grow market share and that is precisely what we have been doing in this
enterprise space.
Now when you think about Big Data, what is the Microsoft approach and it is pretty
simple? We have this idea that there is these massive amounts of data that is being
created. We want to help companies take that data, turn it into information, take the
information, turn it into knowledge. And more importantly turn the knowledge and
turn it into decisions. And it is all about having access and being able to drive that
across devices, being able to have powerful engaging tools that people are familiar
with and being able to connect across your entire platform, across structured and
unstructured data is a very important part of Big Data and analytics.
Now when you think about our oﬀerings speciﬁcally, we have a couple core things
that we drive. Number one, we want to drive insights through this integration with
Excel and Hadoop. We have made a big bet on Hadoop and being able to be
completely aligned with Apache gives us the unique position in this area of BI and
Big Data and analytics. And we now have Hadoop on Windows from Hortonworks.
We also have the ability to manage and spin up Hadoop clusters on Windows Azure
now and the ability to make that seamless and easy for customers is something we
have worked hard on this past year.
We have a SQL Server 2012 parallel data warehouse SKU and we also have an
HDInsight Server SKU. So we have got a couple of SKUs for private cloud
environments or behind the ﬁrewall environments that we can really spin up some
nice, great, very friendly opportunities for people to really embrace Big Data and
analytics in a very unobtrusive way. Then certainly we have got great tools wrapped
around Excel and SQL Server with HDInsight service. And the ability to either put
that on Azure or bring those services to the behind the ﬁrewall private cloud
environment.
So we have got a really exciting Big Data story again all built around value and
eﬀectiveness. And that is our strategy for continuing to grow share in that space.
When we come in and compete with the other guys, it is really about here is the
value we can bring you and here is what we cost and our value proposition and
model is such that it is very, very compelling for enterprises to continue to look at
Microsoft for the enterprise in a diﬀerent unique way. And so we're working hard on
strengthening this position, our position in the enterprise.
And one of the things that I saw recently, which I thought was pretty cool, was there

megavendor will be critical and indispensable to your organization's IT environment

Page 12 of 17If you look at it, 2012 is really that, what I would say, green or (fuqua) color. 2013 is
the dark blue. You can kind of see what happens there with some of the technology
companies and where they are going. When you go through this list and you look at
it, this is what enterprise customers are saying independently about the prospects of
Microsoft in the enterprise. 45% in 2013 thought we would be indispensable to their
organization's IT environment going forward. And that is not a secret. That is not a
surprise. We have been hard at work on building and nurturing this enterprise
business for a long, long time. And that is why that share -- those share opportunities
continue to resonate and show that.
Now the cloud momentum we have is quite substantial, ladies and gentlemen. We
have all -- I mean big companies around the world have had global rollouts of our
cloud services and have been very happy on our cloud services. The acceleration
and momentum we have in this space is one we are going to continue to see, we
continue to expect to see and again, we are right in the midst of transforming our
Company around that.
Now let me talk about Windows 8. Windows 8 was a very, very bold piece of
innovation that we did this past year. And we could have done a lot of diﬀerent
things with Windows 8. We could've made our phone a big tablet. We probably
could have done that and got it in market sooner than we did. The reality is we chose
a diﬀerent point of view. We chose the point of view that says we need to reinvent an
ecosystem. And I just want to highlight some of these changes that went into
Windows 8 as a reminder for you.
Number one, it is the very ﬁrst time in the history of operating systems that a touch
ﬁrst and touch-centric UI has been created. We did that with Windows 8. We landed
a whole new client-side programming and app model because we used to be
completely limited to dotnet. Now you can develop in the language of your choice
on Windows, Java, C++, CSharp and dotnet as long as you use HTML5 and our
browser.
We also said let's roll out a new app store and we did that. We did it in 135 countries.
We also said let's add support for ARM and system-on-a-chip, as well as Intel and
x86. We did that. No other OS in the history runs across both. We are the only one.
We also said let's design and sell ﬁrst-party hardware. We did that with Surface and
Surface Pro. We anchored on the Microsoft account. So now when you sign into a
Windows product after you get to Windows 8, you have one sign-on and your
background, your images, your digital memory, your cloud, your data, your security,
your preferences, your spreadsheet, your documents, your pictures follow you
regardless of the device.
We also said let's redeﬁne and transform our entire OEM ecosystem and our silicon
ecosystem at the same time around touch. And that transformation is happening and
it is happening -- we would like it to happen faster. But it is happening in real time.
We also said let's inspire a whole new level of devices and creativity with the
platform. That is just now beginning. These new form factors for two-in-ones, for
convertibles, for detachables, where it is going from an embedded standpoint is justFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-30

Page 13 of 17now exploding. The design wins continue to come in and go up in this particular
area.
And we have said, you know what, let's listen and make sure that we take feedback
and we have done that. We have been analyzing the telemetry of Windows 8 and
Windows 8.1, which will come out and there will be a big preview on that at the end
of June, has a lot of the learnings that we have learned. And Windows 8.1 is not a
service pack, ladies and gentlemen; it is a new release loaded with new functionality,
new enablement because we have a foundation and a diﬀerent point of view. So we
have all of the safety, all of the security that enterprises love built into the OS. In
addition to, for the very ﬁrst time in our history, we now have a consistent user
experience across the phone, the tablet, the slate, the laptop, the desktop and the
TV with Xbox TV.
And so the ability to bring that live tile UI is something we took a long-term
approach on and it is one that we feel very good about. But make no mistake, when
you reinvent an entire. And I didn't say reinvigorate, I said reinvent an entire
ecosystem, it is going to take some traction. It is going to take some determination,
persistence and time to be able to drive that. And that is what we are working on.
Now the thing that I would share with you is that at Microsoft. And I have been there
-- it will be eight years in August -- and I have been really hard at work on the
execution mechanisms of the Company, we have been consistently working on our
predictability both from an innovation standpoint and from an execution standpoint
and we have made tremendous progress on that. If you look at our numbers and you
look at our share growth and where we have done, that track record speaks for itself
and it is one that we are very proud of. We have a foundation where execution is
strategic in Microsoft today. We have a foundation where innovation has been
strategic and will continue to be going forward.
One of the things that I think is really profound is if you look at our history and where
we are as a company, this innovation that we had -- the last 12 months was a record
amount of innovation. The next 12 months, ladies and gentlemen. is even bigger. We
are again doubling down on innovation. There is more products, more solutions,
more services coming to market in the next 12 months, stuﬀ I didn't even get to
today, than we had in the last 12 months. So that innovation machine, that innovation
execution is just ramping up into this devices and services world in a big, big way
and we feel very, very good about that position.
So with that, I think I would like to conclude. But let me conclude with a couple of
remarks and then we will open it up for some questions. Number one, we are in the
midst of this journey to devices and services. We don't think we are in the last
chapter; we are not in the ﬁrst chapter either. We have been on this journey a while.
But we still have a lot of work to do. We have got a lot of work to do in devices, we
have got a lot of work to do in services. But we are a company that is building that
out in a thoughtful way as we reinvent the Company around the strength of the
enterprise, the value that we get from consumer and bringing the best of both those
worlds together to get the synergies is what makes Microsoft very unique.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-30

Questions And Answers
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
So Kevin, since we have only a couple minutes, I will give you a couple of quick
questions. I'm going to ﬁre them at you and see if we can get through them. So
Adobe is making the transition to subscription. They started ﬁrst via incenting and
now they are no longer going to be selling a licensed version. This is the last version.
Does Microsoft see that they can drive the move to subscription within Oﬃce simply
by a functional incentive or do you have to do more?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
I think we are going to continue to oﬀer both. We see the opportunity for us to
continue to drive the Oﬃce product the standard way we always have. But there is a
bigger and bigger uptake of the services side. So I think you will see us continue to
do both.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
As you know, I have been bullish on the Oﬃce 365 opportunity. As head of sales for
Microsoft, can you talk about the opportunity from the clients' point of view?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
You bet. I think it gives clients a unique opportunity to save money because it allows
us to take a lot of the commodity IT and the commodity overhead from them and
pull it into our environment. It allows us to keep them current. It allows us to ensure
that we don't have any piracy and that they are always licensed correct. It allows us
to allow clients to take advantage of the latest and greatest technology and that is
what I think the cloud service oﬀers.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
How do you keep the client churn down?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
You have got to earn their trust and do a great job for them because they have so
many choices today, the customers vote by what they buy and there is no -- there are
consortiums out there like the Research Board. We have gone up dramatically in our
customer satisfaction levels, particularly in enterprises and accounts, by really deeply
getting in there and earning the right to be their trusted advisor and that is what we
have got to continue to do.

A - Kevin TurnerHow much do you think the approaches you have taken are going to aﬀect bringing
down piracy in emerging markets?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
Well the quicker we ramp to cloud services, the better we will be able to get in front
of a lot of the piracy that exists in those markets. We also have other initiatives going
on where we are working with governments on the importance of IP and a lot of
those strategic initiatives and we are seeing some progress. But make no mistake,
that is an uphill climb in emerging markets on piracy reduction.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Windows 8 has had a lukewarm reception. What is your perspective on the
performance? What can you do to stimulate that further?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
I think we have got to keep listening to customers. I think 8.1 is a big step forward for
us. I think the ecosystem has got to hurry. We need more touch devices. Where we
have a touch device in market, the customer satisfaction on that device and that
operating system is the highest of any OS we have ever released. Where we have a
non-touch device, it is not.
So the reality is the ecosystem has got to reinvent itself; that includes Intel. We need
Haswell, we need Braswell, all their future chip architecture helps us and we have got
to have great form factors and great devices coming from the OEMs.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
And do you see ARM part of that plan going forward? (Multiple speakers).
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
We are going to strategically continue to look and invest in ARM. We like the ARM
architecture for the battery life, for the thinness of the device. It allows us to continue
to broaden -- as the phone becomes more popular, it helps us broaden our platform.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Focus 365 and the cloud has been discussed for years. Why is now the time?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
Momentum and scale. I mean we have Coca-Cola worldwide, McDonald's
worldwide. We have big, big companies that have gone with us that are running the
service at scale and it is great to see that service mature, it is great to see the value
that we can bring and it lights up a whole new productivity experience.

space or that uniﬁed communication space with Lync and Skype very seamlessly andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-30

{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
What are your expectations for Xbox One?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
Excited about Xbox One. It is a whole new way and level of entertainment for us,
particularly in the living room. We are excited about the content deals that we have
struck. We are excited about the opportunities we have to continue to really take that
living room entertainment experience across mobile, across the devices and take
that to a completely new level for Microsoft.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Two more and then I think we are going to get pushed oﬀ the table here. To focus on
Azure, how diﬀerentiated is the oﬀering of Azure today from the competition? Why
do you think you are going to win there?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
Well what we started with was platform as a service. We didn't start with
infrastructure as a service. Infrastructure as a service is a real commodity business. It
is an important area. But it is not where we started.
We started at the platform level, which is something the other guys don't have and
so there is a strategic advantage to having a platform as a service that complements
the infrastructure as a service. That is quite diﬀerentiated. We have common
management, we have common tools, we have a common development
environment. We have got a lot of reasons and assets on why we will win in that
space. But the reality is we have a diﬀerent point of view in that space than the other
guys and while the commodity infrastructure as a service is important, it is not the
thing that we are building our business around.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Beautiful. My last one, in your presentation, you noted Big Data is a trend that
Microsoft is well-positioned for. How do you compete against Open Source in that
world?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
Well we embraced Hadoop. So we embraced Hadoop. We run those Hadoop
clusters on our platform and we think that that is a strategic way for us to embrace
the Open Source element plus provide our unique intellectual property around it.
And I think that again is the Microsoft of today that maybe wasn't the Microsoft 10 or
15 years ago. But today is a new day. We have embraced devices and services and
Big Data.

Q - Mark MoerdlerI think I can squeeze one more in quickly. The Microsoft Surface has had limited
distribution to date. We understand that corporate clients are not able yet to buy
through the traditional channels. Where should we think about this going forward?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
Stay tuned. It is coming to more and more retail locations. It is coming to more and
more channels and we are building our supply chain. It is a whole new area for us as
a company and it is one that we are being thoughtful on. But we are bringing it out
strategically and it will continue to go broader and broader.
