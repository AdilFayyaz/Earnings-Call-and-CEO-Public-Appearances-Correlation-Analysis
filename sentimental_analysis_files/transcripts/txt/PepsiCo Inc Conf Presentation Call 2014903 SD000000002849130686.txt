Presentation
{BIO 1500916 <GO>}
Okay. Good morning. We're delighted to be joined now by the heads of PepsiCo
Americas Beverages and Frito-Lay North America. Al Carey has been the CEO of
PepsiCo Americas Beverages since late 2011 and has led the revitalization of that
business in the context of a historically challenged US soft drink landscape. Tom
Greco has headed Frito-Lay since 2011 and driven admirable growth for the segment
while accelerating innovation and cost savings. We look forward to hearing their
takes on major drivers in their respective businesses, ongoing health and wellness
issues, revenue management opportunities, cost savings and category
fragmentation.
So without further ado, I'd like to turn the podium over to Tom.
{BIO 15063682 <GO>}
Well thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Before Al and I discuss our North
American business, I want to refer you to the safe harbor Statement on forward-
looking statements and where you can ﬁnd on our website a reconciliation to Non-
GAAP measures that we'll discuss today. Now, let's get started.
First of all, I'm going to give you a look at the overall PepsiCo North America
business, then I'm going to talk to you a little bit about Frito-Lay and then I'll turn it
over to al to talk about the North American beverage business.
NAB and FLNA are huge part of PepsiCo, representing 52% of PepsiCo revenues and
an even greater percentage of our overall proﬁt. And relative to our CPG
competitors, we enjoy a signiﬁcant scale advantage. In fact, we're almost twice the
size of the closest CPG competitor in North America and ﬁve times the size of others.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 2 of 12In addition, we have large-scale brands. PepsiCo has 9 of the top 50 trademarks at
retail, more than any other CPG company. There are multiple beneﬁts of one
integrated portfolio. First, we realize signiﬁcant cost savings including $1 billion in
ongoing cost synergies globally across procurement, R&D and other functions. We
also beneﬁt on the revenue side from joint promotions and merchandising across
our entire portfolio.
In emerging markets we're able to leverage the foundation that we've built in
beverages to develop our snacks business. Strategically, we get scale beneﬁts when
we integrate consumer and shopper insights across all of our categories. This also
enables increased relevance for our retail and food service partners who value a
broad perspective across categories.
Finally, having an integrated portfolio enables talent development and attraction.
However, the most exciting part of our integrated portfolio is that our categories are
uniquely complementary. In fact, the incidents of co-purchase between salty snacks
and liquid refreshments beverages is higher than other commonly purchased items;
even more than peanut butter and jelly. How about that?
Transitioning to the consumer food and beverage environment in North America,
there is little doubt that our customers are all looking for incremental growth.
PepsiCo has a clear formula to achieve this. We work together with our customers to
develop deep category insights within our respective categories. We then leverage
these consumer insights to understand the demand spaces that our products
compete in. That understanding informs every single thing that we do; how we build
our brands, how we brief our R&D teams on innovation and how we execute in the
marketplace. And this year it's proven to be a winning formula.
In 2014 PepsiCo is by far the largest contributor to food and beverage growth year to
date. We've contributed almost two times the growth dollars of the next-closest CPG
competitor in the US and, as you can see, many companies are actually declining.
However, our performance is not just a result of scale. We beneﬁt from a thoughtful
balance of both scale and focus. In fact, our North American businesses are laser
focused on what it takes to win in each category. For example, the Flavor Kitchen at
Frito-Lay helps us bring great new ﬂavor ideas to life, like the Lays Do Us A Flavor
campaign which we've now executed all over the globe. Also, the Gatorade Sports
Science Institute is at the cutting edge of sports nutrition research working with top
athletes to elevate their game. We know our categories extremely well.
At the same time, in today's world scale also matters. We leverage PepsiCo scale in
procurement and back oﬃce. We also take advantage of partnerships like the NFL,
along with productivity ideas like GES, as well as capability-building technology, all
of which provides scale beneﬁts to our businesses across North America.
Finally, our scale and complementary portfolio helps us better understand the
consumer. Since our brands frequently compete in common demand spaces, we'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 12able to leverage a common demand framework. Examples include Doritos and
Mountain Dew, very popular with millennial consumers, as well as Tostitos and Pepsi,
an important part of any good party.
Our customers fully recognize this and they help us bring this to life in the
marketplace. At Dollar General, Doritos and Dew is a part of a year-long program
which has driven co-purchase transactions up 21% at DG. We also leverage Doritos
and Dew with our Latino consumers with Juntos Disfrutamos Mas.
Another example of scale beneﬁt is how we leverage our NFL partnership with Pepsi
and Lays. Pepsi and Tostitos are the perfect pairing for enjoying your favorite team
and your favorite players. We beneﬁt from this sponsorship throughout the entire
season; from preseason right through to Super Bowl. In fact, when Frito-Lay snacks
are merchandised along with Pepsi CSDs, we not only see more inventory on display,
it also translates to higher sales. Joint displays drive great perimeter inventory,
leading to accelerated sales growth for both snacks and beverages. This is a
competitive advantage that other competitors simply cannot match at retail.
In addition, we leverage the NFL with our food service partners. Our NFL partnership
and powerful PepsiCo lineup enables us to secure new food service venues, like
Heinz Field in 2012 and Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara which we secured in 2013. And
we bring our brands and new products to life in food service throughout NFL
stadiums. Here you can see our presence at Met Life Stadium with our Tostitos carts
and our Pepsi advantage on TV screens at AT&T Stadium in Dallas. Later Al Carey will
provide additional examples of how we leverage our portfolio to win in food service.
Finally, we also leverage PepsiCo scale with our advertising. I'd like to show you a
spot showing World Cup star Lionel Messi. Can we run the video, please? (Video
plays) This high-impact commercial aired in 70 countries all over the world and
featured 3 global superstars: Lays, Messi. And of course Pepsi.
In summary, we leverage our combined portfolio by executing seasonal programs,
innovating with customers, unlocking local opportunities and engaging multicultural
consumers across North America and it's been working. Being part of PepsiCo
brings scale beneﬁts to all of our businesses.
Now, allow me to shift gears to Frito-Lay North America. At Frito-Lay we have an
excellent track record of performance. Our net revenue 5-year CAGR is 3.8%, putting
us at the top of the CPG landscape in North America. In addition, we're laser focused
on productivity which has led to a 6% CAGR on core operating proﬁt and 2.7 points
of operating margin expansion.
As we've talked about before, we achieve sustainable results through a consistent
growth model at PepsiCo which involves building big brands, delivering exciting
innovation to retailers and consumers, world-class execution and productivity to fuel
our growth. We follow this model at Frito-Lay.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 4 of 12Al CareyIn terms of brand building, our Lays Do Us A Flavor campaign has been an
overwhelming success story. Last year we thought we'd made it big with 4 million
entries in the US. And in 2014 we had over 14 million consumers submit for the next
new ﬂavor of Lays. Our current campaign is now in full swing and in the most recent
IRI period ending August 10th, Lays scans were up 9%. Take a look at the advertising
we're running this summer right through to the end of September. (Video plays) So
feel free to try the Do Us A Flavor ﬁnalists in the break room next door. We used the
very same campaign up in Canada and our results are equally strong up in Canada.
Of course, new products have always been an important part of our success. In fact,
our innovation contribution to growth has accelerated in recent years at Frito-Lay. In
2013 Tostitos Cantina retail sales exceeded $100 million and it was the number one
savory snack in IRI Pacesetters last year. This year we followed up with the launch of
Tostitos Fajita Scoops and Tostitos Queso Blanco Dip. In addition, we've launched
Lays Kettle Lattice Cut, Rold Gold Pretzel Thins and the Doritos Bold Flavor
experiment, all of which have exceeded expectations in 2014.
And as you know, we're also innovating in macro snacks. In 2014 we launched our
Ready to Go initiative in the cookie/cracker aisle. This includes Grandma's Cookies
and Munchies Crackers. This fall our customers have been very excited to hear our
2015 lineup in cookies and crackers.
Of course, all great brand building and all great innovation must be supported by
world-class execution. We provide our outstanding DSD sales organization with
rigorous selling processes and best-in-class tools and technologies to win in the
marketplace every single day.
Finally, at Frito-Lay we believe the productivity opportunity is signiﬁcant. Our
productivity agenda pursues cost reduction and capability-building initiatives to
deliver results. Within supply chain we continue to expand GES. By the end of 2014
we'll have six sites in play. GES continues to be a huge unlock for us, enabling more
SKU capacity with fewer facilities while lowering inventory levels. The exciting part
about GES is that it is both a productivity generator and a growth enabler.
In addition, we're leveraging automation. This includes automating packaging, case
picking and fork lift transportation. Productivity allows us to invest in our growth.
Frito-Lay remains focused on driving growth and productivity to ensure leadership
across the North American CPG landscape.
Now I'd like to invite my friend Al Carey to come and talk to you about the North
American beverage business.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Good morning, everyone. Thanks, Tom. Michael, thanks for the invite this morning.
It's a pleasure to be here with all of you. And I thought what I'd do for the next
couple of minutes is take you through a bit of an update on where we are in the
North American beverage business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 5 of 12We did a pretty signiﬁcant restructure of our business in North America 2.5 years
ago and we took signiﬁcant costs out of the system. And our plan then was to
reinvest in the way we focus on the consumer, the way we serve our customers and
then good returns on the business. And while I'd tell you that we're not where we
want to be yet, we've made signiﬁcant progress despite some signiﬁcant headwinds
in the beverage category and, speciﬁcally, CSDs. So I feel pretty optimistic about
where we're heading and I'll give you a brief review of that right now.
So for starters, under the consumer focus on innovation, we're probably doing twice
as much innovation as we did several years ago. And our brand health scores on the
top four brands are moving in the right direction; signiﬁcant on three of them. And
our shares have stabilized and have slightly ticked up here in the last six months to
nine months.
On the serving customer side, I feel very good about where we are in execution. I'll
give you a couple of examples of that in a minute. But I'd also say that one thing
that's helping in execution and in share is what Tom and I are doing to put our teams
together and call on the customer as One PepsiCo, both at retail and at food service.
And I'll give you some more speciﬁcs about the food service side of the business,
which is now a One PepsiCo food service team.
When it comes to productivity and improving returns, I think we have good CapEx
discipline in our organization right now. We've had signiﬁcant productivity and I see
that continuing for the next ﬁve years. Our revenue management and price
realization plans are much better than where they were in the past and some of our
new products are contributing to that and we have a leaner organization than we did
before.
Now, Tom showed this slide before and this is the IRI MULO C data which shows
sales to all retail channels and it says that PepsiCo has contributed more growth to
our customers than any other retailer. And there were two things he didn't say about
this slide that I'll give you right now. One is it's a pretty tough retail environment out
there. If you look at this slide through the ﬁrst half of the year, there are only 7 or 8
manufacturers who are recording growth out of the top 20. So it gives you an idea,
relatively speaking, how diﬃcult it is in the food business. It's only growing about
1.5% to 2%.
The second thing is, if you stripped out the North American beverage business for
PepsiCo alone, we rank third in contribution growth. So that's a big improvement in
where we were before. We weren't even ranking anywhere near that. But how
showing some improvement in our overall sales growth.
Now we'll take a look at some of the consumer work, the result of the reinvestment
in the monies we've put against the brands. In the ﬁrst half of the year Gatorade was
the second best contributor to growth for our retailers. I think Gatorade is making
good progress at going back to the basics to be a drink for the sports occasion, the
point of sweat.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 12If you look at Mountain Dew, we're having a very good year on Mountain Dew and
that is really driven oﬀ of our merchandising strategy and new products. And the
same thing goes for the next two, Lipton and Starbucks. Starbucks is the ﬁfth biggest
contributor to growth; Lipton is nine. And both of those are driven oﬀ of a
merchandising strategy, as well as some new products. Naked Juice is number 11,
beneﬁting from premium juice growth in the US today. And ﬁnally, Aquaﬁna holding
its own. So those are 6 of the top 12 brands that are growing in America. So that's an
improvement of where we were.
Now here's an interesting new development in that the CSD business is stabilizing
although the diets are not. And we're working on several solutions for the diets. But
in terms of the regular full-sugared sodas, our Wild Cherry Pepsi business is growing
signiﬁcantly, showing that young people, especially millennials, like ﬂavored product.
We've launched a real sugar product this summer which includes both vanilla and
cherry; no high fructose corn syrup, all real sugar. And it is doing very well. 7.5-ounce
mini cans are doing very well as is glass. And our Mountain Dew business is doing
well, particularly the Kickstart business that is almost a $250 million business after its
second year in the marketplace.
I feel very good from a future standpoint. So out of the seven fastest-growing
categories in beverages for the next ﬁve years, we have a very strong position in six
of them. And if you take a look at each one of these, I'll take a minute. The ﬂavored
CSDs will grow rapidly over the next ﬁve years. Most of that is caused by millennials
liking ﬂavors. But mostly the Hispanic inﬂuence on our population. And Mountain
Dew is the number one ﬂavored drink. We have had some very good progress on
Mountain Dew because of the introduction of Kickstart. Our base business of
Mountain Dew is strong. Then also, this Baja Blast that was rolled out this summer
was exceptional; better than we imagined.
Then we have sports drinks. Gatorade is number one. We have a solid business there
that's growing well. We have some new packaging and new forums that are also
picking up the business. We have our Lipton Tea business. We are now the number
one tea brand in America. Pure Leaf Tea is the biggest contributor. And if you look in
the future, there's a can up there that shows a Sparkling Tea. Our consumer research
shows that a Sparkling Tea drink with low calories and real tea credentials has got
tremendous potential and that's a product we'll be launching in the early part of next
year.
Ready to drink coﬀee? We're number one by a long shot. That iced coﬀee has been
a real good contributor to us. Premium juices and water. And you can see on the
water slide we've made some big -- for next year we have a product called Propel
Electrolyte Water that's got the same electrolyte levels as Gatorade and it's brought
to you by Gatorade, the Propel brand. And it's going to be a very good product. We
call it the Workout Water. Then we've got a very much improved product on ONE
Coconut Water.
So if you look at this whole portfolio of six of the seven fastest-growing categories in
beverages of the future, we have a good position in each of those and I feel prettyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 7 of 12good about our ability to grow the business going forward. Also with the consumer,
under the headline of the consumer investment.
The best part of last year, in my opinion, or this -- early part of this year, that some of
the brands that we launched last year, very often they'll go up and spike and then
they come back down again in the second year when you don't reinvest as strongly
as you should. These four brands that were introduced last year, when they hit their
anniversary they've now overlapped the anniversary with double digit growth. So if
you take Pure Leaf Tea, for example, that's the third year in a row of signiﬁcant
growth. Pure Leaf is up 40% this year. It was up 40% last year. If you take a look at
Kickstart, it did $175 million in revenue last year at retail. It's going to be about $250
by the time we get done with the second year. Farmstand is up double digit. Then
also the Gatorade Frost.
Moving over on innovation also to packaging and equipment, which is kind of new
for us. They've done very well with these diﬀerent packages and especially glass and
the mini cans. And here's where packaging can improve your price realization. So if
you take a look at the glass bottle of Pepsi, we sell 12 ounces of glass Pepsi for $1. We
sell 12 ounces of Pepsi in a 12-ounce can for $0.35. So as we move the mix to these
kinds of packages, it gives us tremendous opportunity to improve the overall
margins for us and then also for our retailers as well.
The reinvestment in the business is working pretty well. We now have a master brand
strategy on Pepsi where you won't see a Pepsi Next campaign, a Pepsi Max, a Diet
Pepsi, a regular; we have one Pepsi campaign. It's worked pretty well for us so far this
year. But I would tell you that we are improving our brand health scores, especially
with millennials, on Pepsi. Still more work to do on Pepsi.
But if you look at the reinvestment in Mountain Dew, it's been exceptional. We've
had -- not only in increased advertising and digital on Mountain Dew. But new
products in Kickstart. And overall, this brand's health scores, particularly with young
men, have been exceptionally good. Gatorade, probably the highest brand health
scores we've had in a long time, particularly with young athletes. Then this Pure Leaf
Tea has done very well. The numbers are very high in terms of satisfying millennials.
So it feels good that the investment that we've made in these brands is starting to
pay oﬀ. We tried to do this in a very deliberate way, not trying to do everything all in
one year. It's been a brick-by-brick process. Lots of room to improve and more
progress needs to be made. But we're deﬁnitely making some progress.
Now I move to the execution. I'll give you an example of two kinds of execution that I
think have improved. One is this thing we call pure plays, where we'll actually put up
a display in a store that's 100% devoted to one brand. We have put over 100,000
units of these products out in the marketplace year to date. Mountain Dew and
Starbucks are the ones that are the most successful. And the rules that we have
inside of our organization are you put these displays up. Everybody's got a target on
how many they need to hit. No promoted goods go on these displays. This is allFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 8 of 12single serve, cold bottle, new products and products that are typically not
discounted deeply. So they've worked very well for us and I'm very encouraged with
the proﬁt margins that come from that and our retailers are starting to see that as
well.
Then also, as Tom had mentioned, working with our NFL property and working with
Game Time at Wal-Mart and NFL Kickoﬀ with other accounts with Frito-Lay, this has
become much improved over the last couple of years and I'm very optimistic. Today
we start a Game Time event with Wal-Mart and a great result so far.
Now, I mentioned something about food service under the headline of execution.
We have created one PepsiCo food service organization and here's what the beneﬁt
is. Instead of going into a food service customer. And it's a battle between us and
our competitor on who's got the lower price, this has become a food and beverage
innovation and food and beverage solution presentation. So when Frito and Pepsi,
all the food businesses and all of the beverage innovation gets put together, I think
it's a more compelling argument for the strength of PepsiCo in the food service
business which, by the way, is an area we have a lot of ground to make up.
And what we've done in food service, one of the best examples is Taco Bell. So
we've taken that Kickstart Mountain Dew and a Baja Blast, put it into a frozen. And
we've also got this Doritos Locos Tacos, which has been an enormous success for
Taco Bell. But it's also been an enormous success with the investment they made.
And the Doritos brand, we're seeing it in Tom's numbers now.
We also came to 7-Eleven with a product called Doritos Loaded. It was launched
about a month ago. And we also accompanied that with a Solar Flare customized
exclusive product that we made just for 7-Eleven on Mountain Dew. Another great
example of putting the two brands together for scale.
And I would tell you that our recent success of winning the business at Buﬀalo Wild
Wings was largely done because of the strength of the overall dual portfolio. Food
innovation, as well as beverage innovation and service. And I'd throw in Mountain
Dew as well, when you're serving young men or young people, while they're
watching sports events, Mountain Dew plays a very big role. So I feel good about
where we're heading here.
Then the other part of the food service business is the innovation on equipment. So
if you take a look at this ﬁre equipment, which is a lower cost piece of equipment.
And it also has got a digital component to it that allows you to pick over 100 varieties
of products, including ﬂavored water, sparkling water and ﬂavored variations of our
product.
Then we move to -- I think is an even bigger innovation is starting to retroﬁt some of
the old equipment that's already out there. So we'll take some of our old equipment,
send it to a refurb center, it comes back out -- we call it certiﬁed pre-owned. But thenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 9 of 12we'll put a reﬁt on it that makes it look very contemporary. Then this is some of the
feedback we've gotten from our customers.
The food service customers that serve fountain will tell you I'm tired of selling the
same old things on the fountain. Why don't you bring some of the innovation and
the new products that are really growing in the marketplace to the fountain? And it's
a very good issue. So when you come into a food service account and you're a mom
with some kids, you don't want the same old product, you want something else. And
especially products that are a little healthier and those that have lower calories.
So here's -- imagine this -- and this will be a reality in the very near future, starting
probably in 2015. Had a big request from customers; real sugar Pepsi on the
fountain. That's easy to do. That's going back in time in terms of technology. We
know how to do that.
Sparkling Iced Tea, Izze, Kickstart and SoBe Life Water with zero calories. Now, what's
interesting is the SoBe Life Water with zero calories is actually out there right now.
And in some parts of the country where some of our food service sales force has
gone ahead and put SoBe Life Water on one of the heads of the fountain, our
business went up 7 points on the fountain just from having a zero calorie interesting
product to oﬀer to the consumers. When we oﬀer this whole portfolio, I think we'll
drive growth in that whole fountain category. And these are all reality -- this is not a
ﬁgment of my imagination. These are products that'll be in the marketplace next
year.
On productivity, signiﬁcant productivity has been made since 2010 when we bought
the bottlers. We've closed 24% of the plants. The ﬁrst half of this year we closed a
signiﬁcant number of plants so far to improve our productivity. We are going
through a signiﬁcant automation plan and also something that is called Geobox,
which is a more eﬃcient delivery system for the route trucks. We're restructuring the
go-to-market very similar to the GES program that Tom has done where we're taking
inventory out of the system, more cross-docking facilities, less places that hold
inventory. Then, ﬁnally, we have a productivity plan that's very strong for the next ﬁve
years. And PepsiCo has stepped for an additional $1 billion in productivity and we
have our fair share of that and I feel conﬁdent that the initiatives that add up to that
are things that are well within our ability to accomplish.
I'll close on -- just have two last slides. I have a lot of passion for this subject and this
also has something to do with proﬁtability for the category and growth for the
category.
So imagine -- on this slide to the left we've got promoted packs. And what I'm
deﬁning is promoted packs in the LRB business is every imaginable way you can
pack 12-ounce cans and two liter. These are all the discounted products. They
represent about 20% of the mix for the industry. They're more like 30% of the mix for
us. They're declining by 3% for the industry. That means all the CSD people,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 10 of 12Q - Michael Brancapromoted packs down 3%. The rest of the LRB business in this timeframe has grown
at a CAGR of 4.2%. I think we'd all be very happy with a 4.2% number.
What's interesting is, if you could look at the investments and the money that's spent
to drive the promoted packs, trying to match the prices of the year before and trying
to overlap the promoted holiday features from the year before, it's a tremendous
amount of money. And it's declining 3%. And it's unlikely the baby boomers want to
buy a lot of 24-pack Pepsi. I think we need to move the business in a direction where
the consumer's going and that's away from these promoted packs. If you just took
some of that money that we invest in these promoted packs and moved it into the
rest of the portfolio, we would see a signiﬁcant increase in that 4.2%. And we have a
good portfolio in that lineup. By the way, in that 4.2% is also other CSD products like
single serve and diﬀerent packs that have more proﬁtability to it.
Now. So the next question I had before -- when our team presented this was what
about CSDs that are not promoted packs? They're even growing 2.5%. So things like
Mountain Dew and things like -- products that -- mini cans and glass bottles and not
the same old promoted packs. This has -- I could go on for an hour. And this has got
more potential than anything else in our business and we're rigorously going after
this to make sure that we take advantage of the opportunity. I think there's more
growth in the category of LRB if we reapportion the resources.
So takeaways from our business. I think as One PepsiCo, Tom and I together, we have
focus. We have taken those investments that we did 2.5 years ago against the brands
and they're showing up in brand health and innovation. We've put a signiﬁcant
amount of innovation in the marketplace compared to a few years ago. Our
execution is better. Frito-Lay is rock solid consistent. And I think I'd say that our NAB
is strengthening. A lot of room to improve, though.
Then if you look at the scale of the two businesses when you put them together, we
are the number one supplier to the retailer, which gives you a seat at the table for
strategic discussions. The number one driver of growth. Tom's team is the number
one brand -- have number one brands in macro snacks. And we are the number one
beverage company at retail. And even though we have 22 $1 billion brands in the
world for PepsiCo, we have 19 in the US alone. So just oﬀ of the volume there.
So that concludes the presentation. Hopefully that gives you a little bit of an update
on where we stand, both on the Better Together initiative, Frito's performance and
then the report card on how we're doing on the beverage business in North
America.
And I think now, Michael, we go to a Q&A section, right?
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1500916 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 11 of 12A - Al Carey
Q - Michael Branca
A - Al Carey
A - Tom GrecoWe'll have time for a couple questions.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 1500916 <GO>}
Thanks. Al, obviously the US CSB category has seen very little real pricing for quite a
long time. And you've implemented quite a number of initiatives to try and improve
that with everyday value, product and package innovation. Could you maybe
dimensionalize the scope of the opportunity as you see it for PepsiCo?
Then, Tom, if you would, you talked about scale beneﬁts of the back oﬃce and
procurement and give us a touch of an update on the GSE program -- or GES
program, excuse me, with the six sites. Could you kind of bring us up to speed on
the timeline and what kind of productivity savings you see from GES speciﬁcally?
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
I'll go ﬁrst on the pricing. So I think there's a great opportunity to have a rational
pricing environment. And the hybrid EDV that you're referring to, which is -- we're
very much going after raise the price on the holidays for these carbonated soft
drinks and lower them for the everyday and the net will be an improved proﬁtability
for the retailer and us. We've made some progress on that and it's showing up in our
business. But I will tell you, it's a tricky one. Because if a retailer gets to a holiday and
they feel like they need volume, they still sometimes will not cooperate and price
aggressively. But we're making progress.
In the ﬁrst part of -- these are IRI category numbers. There was only about a point
and a half of pricing in the market. But it's gone up. If you look in quarter two and
quarter three, it's more like 2.5% in pricing; some mix, some rate. But I think the
trend is an improved pricing in the marketplace and a more rational pricing
environment.

Yes. And on the productivity, I mean, a couple of responses there, Michael. I mean,
ﬁrst of all, on the global level we look for scale beneﬁts across the big functions. So
you mentioned R&D, procurement, A&M. I showed that spot on Pepsi and Lays with
Messi; 70 markets, 1 production cost. So the global groups continue to look for scale
beneﬁts across all of PepsiCo.
In North America Al and I are working on North American scale beneﬁt
opportunities. Those can be in the commercial area, the NFL sponsorship. We
actually see a lot of room for continued scale beneﬁts here in North America as we
look for ways to leverage the entire business here.
On GES, speciﬁcally Frito, our productivity agenda was increased by 50% in 2012.
But we increased it each year, 2013 and 2014. We've hit our productivity target eachFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-09-03
