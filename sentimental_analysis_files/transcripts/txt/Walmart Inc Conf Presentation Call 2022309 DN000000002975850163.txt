Okay everybody. We have seen the biggest Investment for (inaudible) Consumer
Conference. I am (inaudible) from BOA Global Research. We're really pleased to
have Brett Biggs, the EVP and CFO, Walmart Stores with us here today. If you don't
know Brett, I'm pretty sure most of you do, Brett has been with Walmart since 2000,
working in several diﬀerent roles. He was EVP and CFO, Walmart International. He
was EVP and CFO, Walmart US Division. He has also worked as both the CFO and
later an SVP of Operations at Sam's Club. He was also SVP of International Strategy
M&A. So, I think this could be the last time that you appear here because as Brett, I
think, plans to leave the Company at the end of this ﬁscal year after 22 years. So, he
is going to be very missed I'm sure from Walmart, but deﬁnitely by people like me at
BOA. So, Kendall and I feel honored that Brett made it here today; and I want to
thank Kary Brunner for showing up as well. But, I'm going to start oﬀ with my ﬁrst
question for Brett, which is, can you just walk us through the drivers to over 3%
comps and maybe put it in the context of inﬂation and other things that might be
going on for (multiple speakers).
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, thanks for having me. It's been -- it's a bit real to be back in-person here. I think
it's been -- it must have been a couple of years really since we've done this live, so
it's great to be back around people and answer these questions live more than what
we were doing over the last couple of years. The business as you would have seen in
Q4 is performing really well across the company, whether that Sam's, US
International. I feel great about the strength of the underlying business.
The 3% comp that we talked about is on top of pretty big number. We've added a
signiﬁcant sales volume to the US over the last couple of years. Walmart US is 15% to
your stack over two years. But there are really a number of things that I think get us
comfortable with that and some of that is just the evolving nature of the business asFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-09

Brett Biggswe were seeing people obviously come back in stores for (inaudible) very strong.
Our e-commerce business has roughly doubled over the last couple of years with
these newer businesses that we're also spending time and resources and seeing
good results from those.
As all of those things combine and make us feel good about the business, we've
continued to grow market share in food. So that's always been a driver for the
company, particularly with the supercenter many, many years ago. But our GM
business is strong and we still get good attachment with the GM baskets of food. So
when you think about all of those things together and you've heard me say a
number of times, Ravi, about our ability to pull diﬀerent levers, it's all of the levers
that we have to pull, but I think makes us feel good about the guidance and good
about the business.
Within that, I think your store traﬃc has remained positive. How much of that is
people returning to stores and versus your pickup and delivery continuing to grow
so fast and maybe a little help on what you're doing right there?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, it's sum of both. Certainly went through a period of time during COVID. The
early parts of COVID where people couldn't come in the stores or were choosing to
stay home and we've seen a reversal. We saw a reversal of that last year and
probably a little quicker than we would have anticipated that the store traﬃc would
come back, particularly in parts of the country it came back more quickly than we
would have thought. But, the businesses that we continue to grow, whether you said
pickup, delivery, the work we're doing in home, it's all of these diﬀerent ways that
customers can shop with us, go local, that I think makes a diﬀerence and continues
to get us top of mind with shoppers. That's what we want when we talk about the
omni strategy and our ﬂywheel as when customers think about shopping that
Walmart is the ﬁrst place that comes to mind for them because they know whether I
want to go pick up my car, I want to go in the store, I want to shop at home, I can do
all that with one company and we think we're giving the customer that today.
Speaking of customers, I wanted to ask you the -- I mean you guys probably know
the broader US customer better than anybody. So really from three aspects. The ﬁrst
is just what is your customer? How are they responding to just general inﬂation out
there and maybe we could include -- maybe general inﬂation and then gas inﬂation
maybe two separate, but connected? How does that historically aﬀected your
customer and how do you think it will this time?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We know from our own surveys and things that you read that certainly inﬂation is on
people's minds. They are noticing it. We said this in our Q4 earnings release that theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-09

Page 3 of 16Unidentiﬁed Participant

Unidentiﬁed Participantcustomer and consumer we still feel like is in pretty good shape and that was part of
our guidance that we gave as we came into this year. The increase in fuel prices is
going to get people's attention certainly and I'm sure we'll talk about that.
But Walmart, if you look at our customer base, we really span the entire
demographics of the United States. We do have a component of our customer that
would be lower-middle income customers, but we really span the entire breadth. We
think that is beneﬁcial to us as a company that we can do incredibly well like we did
in the last couple of years. Now we had tailwinds which we understand with stimulus
and other things, but when the customer really needs us we're there with lower
prices and we have a price caps in great shape. We are able to fulﬁl the needs that
they have and I think we can do that better than anyone else.
What we've seen historically with fuel prices when they increase as you tend to see a
lot of consolidation with shopping trips, you'll tend to see fewer trips, you'll tend to
see bigger baskets which again bigger baskets are usually our sweet spot. So as
customers need us like they always do, but maybe need us a little more now, we feel
like we're in great shape to be there for them.
The other one is just on stimulus. Can you maybe remind us what have you seen last
year in February, March, and April when the big stuﬀ hit and then what's the
expectation when you anniversary it?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
If you remember, I think we had our Analyst Meeting mid February and then right
after that one of the big stimulus was announced. So really, March and April, we saw
a large increase in sales and operating income, particularly in general merchandise
side and food continued to be steady as it always is, but general merchandise was
big. That's why we've talked about ﬁrst quarter will be down fairly signiﬁcantly
because of last year. But when you look at the two years together, we're in a really
strong still to your stack.
Every quarter right now feels a little bit diﬀerent, somewhat because of what we're
lapping from last year as you went through the stimulus and then you had COVID up
a little bit in the second quarter and then obviously get in the fourth quarter last year.
And that inﬂuenced buying habits as well as people, our own associates and their
ability to get to work and all of those things. And so as we go through the year, we'll
be really transparent about how we're seeing this quarter compares to what we saw
last year.
There have been a couple of other large retailers here on the grocery and
warehouse club industry. We've asked them about trade down versus trade up.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-09

Unidentiﬁed ParticipantThere hasn't necessarily been trade down seen yet. Is that -- would you say that's
true for Walmart also, is the customer trading down or are they trading up?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We haven't still seen what I'd call a meaningful change and how customers are
shopping and there are a lot of things I'm sure that inﬂuence that. Unemployment is
low, wage rates are high. Savings rates are still in pretty good shape. So a lot of those
things will help. Again, I think the great thing for the way that we do business is
customers trade call it trade-up/trade-down. We have all the products that they're
going to need. We have diﬀerent price points they got to need. We have private
label. We have other things that can satisfy wherever the customer is at that time and
I think we're unique in that way.
I'm going to shift over to another thing that we were all hoping. It was going to be
less talked about as we move through this year, but now it's back up again, is supply
chain. There were some great things you guys did in 2021. I think you guys kind of
were saying that you were going to be pretty well stocked for holiday relative and
you were. Can you do that again? You guys -- are you the largest importer of
merchandise into the United States basically?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Fortunately for us, about two-third of what we sell or what we sell in our stores is
either made or assembled in the US and that helps a lot. So, it's a good starting point
for what it takes to stay in-stock. We do import good certainly from diﬀerent
countries. Our merchants are so experienced and our supply chain teams are so
experienced. You go back even three years ago, we were talking about tariﬀs and
then you had supply chain issues and so every one of these types of things is
diﬀerent, but a lot of experience has helped us -- helped us weather this probably
some better than others.
Still having some longer lead times on things. Still not quite in-stock that where we
want to be on every category. You saw our US inventory of 28% in the fourth quarter.
I feel good about it, but that indicates some longer lead times and ordering ahead
that you might not see in normal times. In general, we feel like parts of the disruption
that are getting a little better and we've seen that in the last couple of months. We
thought that might happen as we get through the holidays. That is what we are
anticipating. Obviously, there're still a number of things going on in the world that
could impact, whether that's COVID or other things that are going on and we're
going to be mindful of that and continue to have our teams do what they do really
well and keep us in-stock.
Are there any -- would there be anything you've learned over the last year or two
that would encourage Walmart to look at diﬀerent ways to do supply chain? WouldFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-09

{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Probably nothing that dramatic. But the thing -- it doesn't surprise me, but it always
amazes me is how quickly and how ﬂexibly the company can move. Looking at
everything we experienced in the last two years starting with March and April of
2021, the demand on product was unbelievable and we went from few 100 stores
that could ship directly to home to thousands of stores that could ship directly to
home in a month. The ability to think about having your own vessels to bring
products and the ability to get products oﬀ of a shipping line in a diﬀerent way, all of
those things were incredibly creative. So what gives me hope about this current year
is that that creativity won't go away and we'll ﬁnd creative ways to work our way
through this. We've seen things in the last two years (inaudible) that we would ever
see or ever have to experience and it just gives me conﬁdence in the team that we
have that will work our way through things.
What are you guys seeing these days on the labor front? Are you getting everybody
you want to get and do you think the wage increases is a kind of every year thing
going forward here for the industry or how should we think about that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We were able to hire really well for the holidays. We hired a couple of hundred
thousand people before the holidays, which is pretty amazing on any scale. And if
you go back, Ravi, a couple of years ago, we were pretty proactive in raising wages
and our stores and our supply chain as well, and I think we got ahead of some of
what was coming. If you look at our average wage rates in stores now, we're over
1640 for hourly wages. Sam's a little higher than that. Our distribution centers will be
or supply chain will be over $20 an hour. So, I think we're in pretty good shape from
that standpoint. The things that give me a little bit of encouraging even though
unemployment is low, a number I watch quite a bit is the labor participation rate.
That seems to be ticking up a little bit, so maybe more people coming back into the
labor force that left during COVID. So that would be helpful to get the additional
people back into the labor force, but our ability to hire has been good.
When you raise wages and when you see larger employers across the US raising
wages, I mean how quickly do you see that show up in topline of Walmart US?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
First raise wages.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 16Brett Biggs
Unidentiﬁed Participant
Brett BiggsYeah. When you see wages going up, does it translate to better sales for you guys
typically?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think you see it probably more pronounced when you're taking more proactive
action, like we did a couple of years ago when we were proactive not only around
that, but we were looking at beneﬁts around live better you. So the educational
service that we had when you're looking at for 1K beneﬁts, when you're looking at
things like that and looking at bonus structures. When it's I think a more proactive
environment, you tend to see more beneﬁt from that and that's why I'm glad of what
we did over the last couple of years. I think it is a signal to your team that you're
wanting to invest in them and know that invest in their career is still, I think I could
get the number wrong, but I think about 75%. So of our store manager started as
hourly associates.
So not only are they looking at pay, they're able to look and see that guy or gal that's
my store manager, they started out just like I did and I can do that and make -- have a
great career and make a substantial amount of money. I think we have going forward
as well.
Okay. Now, we are just going to ask question that has to be asked. Can you just take
us through that gross margin, puts and takes, what's it going to be the next couple of
years, how high can it go?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I've gotten (technical diﬃculty) on gross margin. Yeah, I'll go back to Q3 and we had
US gross margins that went down a little bit and I know it garnered probably more
attention than I would have been participated for any one quarter. Ravi, I think you've
heard me say now for almost seven years, it's really hard to look at one quarter gross
margins, so please don't do that. Then in Q3, I think we did that. I felt good at that
time that we're going to see Q4 be a little bit diﬀerent and it was. US margins were
up quite a bit in Q4 and there are several things. One, there're just so many things
that go into gross margin. And particularly when you get into environment, it's a little
bit inﬂationary. You're going to have some lag at times in the way prices move, in the
way you're able to change prices which we've had to take the prices up on some
things.
But I feel good about our margin overall and that our mix continues to get better as
we continue to have more general merchandise and particularly in our e-commerce
business that helps with margins. When you look at shipping costs and the ability to
ship more eﬀectively with the capital that we're putting in supply chain, I feel good
about that. That helps the contribution margin. When you look at the new businesses
or newer businesses that we're in or getting into which is advertising that helps the
margins also helps with suppliers and with customer retention. I feel great about ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-09

Brett Biggsmarketplace business, we added 20,000 sellers. Last year, I think we'll add another
40 this year.
And that's something that when you get that 1P/3P mix a little bit diﬀerent inside the
commerce business, that helps. So as I look in longer term and we've said that we
think gross margins will be a little bit higher next year than they were this year, but I
feel good longer-term about where the gross margin of the business could be.
Is quarter-to-quarter going to be exactly straight lined? Probably not because
there're a lot of things that go into the gross margin. But as you look at it on a yearly
basis or semi-annual basis, I feel good about that.
From a shorter-term perspective, how should we think about things like beneﬁts you
probably saw from COVID vaccines in the pharmacy? Any other things that we
should be thinking about as headwinds in the kind of short-term this year?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, like I said, there are so many things from last year that every quarter we have to
come out and help you and remind everybody we had this year, we didn't have this
year, not quite business as usual as we would have seen a few years ago. So there
are some things like that. There will be a little bit of headwinds last year, but we've
got some -- versus last year, but we've got some businesses this year that are bigger
than they would have been last year that are going to help. Marketplace has gotten
bigger. Our mix continues to improve. I think all of those things will play out
positively as year goes along.
And then I think you warned us to at least expect a little bit of deleverage this year.
Can you kind of walk us through as much as you're allowed to on the detail behind
that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
You'll remember you go back six years ago when we came out and said we're going
to invest some in stores and then e-commerce. We did that, but we said we feel
good about the business going forward to drive top line. I think we've done that. But
it was at that time I think we took another sharp look at our cost culture inside the
company, which has always been a hallmark of Walmart. I still feel really good about
the cost culture that I see inside the company. There are things that are certainly
higher than they were last year. Wages we've talked about, we were lapping some
wage investments that we made last year that won't fully lap till we get into kind of
the middle part of this year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-09

Brett BiggsCOVID costs were up again in the fourth quarter, but if we don't get another variant,
I expect those will get back to a little more normal level like we saw maybe in Q2 and
Q3. Supply chain costs, we'll see how that goes through the year. We had some
elevated costs in Q4 that we certainly don't anticipate of being at that level
throughout the rest of the year, but we'll see how that goes. If you strip out those big
elements and just look at the general cost base of the company and looking at it
longer term, I still feel good about it. I still feel good about our ability to leverage.
You go back two years ago, we said we thought we can lever 20 basis points or so a
year. Take out some of what we've seen in the last couple of years, I still would have
felt good about that number. And, we'll continue to invest in a way that's healthy. The
best way, of course, to leverage expenses is to just keep the top line higher, and I
feel good about our ability to do that long-term.
And then maybe within that top line, how should we -- does this Walmart's approach
to price increases change if it starts to look like inﬂation is going to be a multi-year
mid-single digit plus situation? I don't know how far back we have to go, but I'm sure
there was maybe in the mid '80s. I think it might have been in an environment like
that, what was Walmart's approach to it?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
You and I were really young.
I know. I've been reading a lot of history.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Walmart a long time, not that long.
But what's the approach to regular inﬂation, if we do go into area?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It's tough with hypotheticals, but I can tell you how we talk about it internally and
there are certain cost increases. You're going to get -- you're going to see whether
the commodity prices are going up. First thing we will do is work with our suppliers
to keep their cost increases as low as possible. So that's what we need and to keep
prices lower for customers. So that's the ﬁrst thing we are going to do, we'll be
working with suppliers. We have taken some prices up. The good thing is we have
such a large SKU count and a large basket that we can take it up, I think strategically
in ways that that hopefully impact customers less than some of our competitors do.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 16Unidentiﬁed Participant
Brett BiggsBut our mission is to save people money and that can take on a diﬀerent meaning a
bit when inﬂation is a little more persistent where we still from a competitive
standpoint will be where our customers need us to be. We also have to be
thoughtful shareholders and obviously we do that. I think we're at a point right now
and where I think we're doing a good balancing act of taking care of customers as
well as thank our shareholders. I think you saw that in the fourth quarter with the way
the P&L was managed. I think we'll consistently be able to do that.
We are -- you'll hear Doug say where inﬂation ﬁghters for our customers and we view
it that way, but we also know if shareholders that we have to take care of our price
capture in great shape, which I think gives us optionality on how we can continue to
take care of that customer. It gives us more ways to do that maybe some of our
competitors and our merchants are very, very focused on those price gaps.
But if we can get price gaps where we think they need to be to be good for the
customer, we continue to take market share which is really what you saw in Q4. You
saw it in Q3 too. It just looked a little diﬀerent in Q3. I feel good about our
positioning that we can do -- we can fulﬁl our mission so people might they live
better and fulﬁl our mission with the shareholders.
That makes sense. I think we're going to shift over to e-commerce and maybe I'll
start with just a broader question on it and then I think Kendall has a bunch of follow-
ups. How should we think about the -- it looks like penetration is dropping for the
industry a little bit versus on a year-over-year basis. How are you guys thinking about
2022 e-commerce versus in-store?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
2021 was pretty amazing when you look at the growth rates in that year. I think
everybody know you probably won't have those growth rates over again. Again,
people came back to stores a little more quickly than we would have thought. 2023
(inaudible) people I think in ﬁscal year. Calendar year 2021, people came back in the
stores more quickly than we would have thought, so already e-commerce number
growth rate would have been a little bit lower than we would have anticipated and
you would have seen that. But over two years, basically still roughly double the
business.
So penetration was -- it's going be hard to replicate the year before. The great thing
for us and I kind of answer every question this way, so I'm sorry, but the great thing
for us is the way we have the business structured right now with stores, with e-
commerce, with delivery which really nobody has that. And so, we're somewhat
ambivalent to how customers want to shop. There are parts of that that are more
proﬁtable than others, but it's our job as management to let the customer shop the
way we want to and then we've got to make the P&L work.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 16Unidentiﬁed Participant

Brett BiggsAnd, I feel no concern that we can make that happen. I think e-commerce can
continue to grow. There's no doubt about it. But people are going to continue to
shop in stores and they'll come back in droves into our stores, which is great for us.
And we will turn this way now.
So actually on making P&L for e-commerce work, can you just remind us to what
extent has Walmart been able to improve e-commerce proﬁtability over the past few
years versus how much do you expect that you can -- that you can continue driving
improvements over the next few years?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. We've been really focused on our contribution margin rate and that's
continued to improve and there are several things that drive that mix is really
important. So, we sell more home and apparel than you do, cans of corn and that's
really good for your product mix and it helps with margin. Variable cost is something
that we look at all the time, which is how much cost to process ship in order. That
continues to come down for us. I think with the capital that we're going to spend
over the next few years that will continue to come down. I feel very conﬁdent about
that. And then, there are services like Walmart Fulﬁllment Services which part of the
capital that we'll be putting in over the next few years is going to be around that as
well. Increasing our ability to fulﬁll that or additional capacity to fulﬁll that for our
sellers, that's going to be a big leverage point for us in the future and then
continuing to grow third-party. So marketplace we're putting a ton of eﬀort into that.
We're making progress I mentioned earlier with the skew count, with the number of
sellers. All of those things if they're moving in the right direction, we will improve
contribution margin and that's what we need in all four of those things right now
(inaudible) direction.
That's helpful. And then shifting gears a little bit. I want to see if we could talk about
some of the alternative proﬁt stream opportunities for Walmart. You guys had
mentioned things from digital advertising to ﬁnancial services and healthcare. What
are you most excited about for 2022 and maybe by 5 to 10 years down the line?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, they're all great. You can talk about -- you can talk about marketplace
(inaudible) services, advertising, ﬁntech, healthcare, data monetization. There are less
than two handful of initiatives that we've spent a lot of time over the last few years. I
think all have a great chance to scale and they all ﬁt really well inside of our business.
The great thing is when you have less than two handfuls, one, there's not too many
of that you can focus; but also, not all of them have to work exactly the same way for
you to have a successful business. Some of these will work way better than we ever
anticipate and there'll be one or two that maybe don't work as well as we think, butFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-09

Brett Biggsthey all have a great base and strategy behind them. There may be feel good about
it. Advertisers are the one that's probably taken oﬀ the quickest of all of those and
we've talked about we have over $2 billion business. Now, I think that's a price
people will hold when we talked about that last quarter, but that's something that
can continue to ramp.
With all the eyeballs that we have on our site and our stores with advertisers, it's a
very natural outﬂow what we do. I'm on the Board of our ﬁntech JV and I work a lot
with Omer Ismail [ph] and Mickey Marco [ph] who were two of the best in the
industry, and we've just announced a couple of acquisitions that we hope to close
soon that I think can really change the way that we interact with our customers on
ﬁnancial services and get more involved in their lives. So, I'm very excited about that.
We talked about marketplace a bit of fulﬁlment services, that can really be game
changing for the entire e-commerce business. We have a great e-commerce
business today and it's growing, but those kinds of things can really be an accelerant
to that business. And then healthcare is a business we've been in for a long time. We
have a big healthcare business already and we are (inaudible) trial diagnostic labs
and all of those things have the potential on their own to be pretty big businesses
for the company, but they all tie in really well to how we interact with our customers.
I wouldn't anticipate us doing something that would surprise investors or analysts
that if you look at the business and I literally can't ﬁgure out how that ties to
Walmart's business even if it were a great business ﬁnancially. It's got to be
something that ties in with our customers and each one of those. I can lay out the
strategy for you and think about what the P&L could be and be very excited about it.
Got it. That's helpful.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
So I can't choose at this point. I'm sorry.
I was just going to ask as a follow-up on digital advertising. Since you guys have
partnered with the Trade Desk, I think it was around a year ago. Maybe can you just
remind us what some of the key changes that you've made in the business to be
able to start scaling it and then what some of the key obstacles that you are still
working to address in order to continue growing the business?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
With that partnership and with that business In general, it's how do you make that
easier for your advertisers, how do you make it more self-service, how do you get
them the access they need to your space, but also spaces outside of your properties
that you own; how do you help them advertise even outside of your properties andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-09

Brett Biggsthen most importantly how do you measure it. That's the holy grill for advertisers,
how do you measure that what they did actually led to a purchase and that takes
adding new tools, adding new capabilities. Those are things that with Trade Desk
and with other things that we've done, making it simpler, making it more on demand
and being able to make it more analytic for the advertisers is the name of the game
there. I think the $2 billion business is indicative that we've been able to do some of
that and it's not just in the US, things we're doing in India, Mexico, Canada. All of
those markets can utilize what we're doing. So, I think it's going to be something that
business going to be very global for us.
That's helpful. And then I guess if there's anything else you could share in terms of
what Walmart is doing in insurance or maybe it's more on what diﬀerent kinds of
ﬁnancial services you see Walmart's opportunities and what are some things you're
working on for 2022?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
That insurance business basically we are a broker of sorts. It is something that ﬁts
pretty nicely at the intersection of healthcare and ﬁnancial services. It's really both.
And as again as part of helping our customers buying the product that's right for
them at the right price point for them, it's a confusing business. I mean buying
insurance can be confusing. There're a lot of options and if we can make that simpler
for our customers and we can get them a better price point for the product that
they're buying, it just ﬁts incredibly well into our mission and where customers need
help in their lives.
And I'll see if Ravi has any follow-ups on some of your alternative proﬁt streams. And
then I know Ravi also had some questions on Sam's Club and International.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Those are pretty big businesses too.
Yeah. They are. Just sort of a sidebar -- ﬁntech, what should I be thinking when you
say ﬁntech?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, it's broader than that actually. That's a good point. I say ﬁntech because that's
what everybody kind of recognizes these days. But it is how do you make the
ﬁnancial part of people's lives easier, how do you help them manage their own P&L,
how do you help them manage their memberships, their subscriptions, just the wayFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-09

Brett Biggsthey integrate with life. We have so many touch points of that customer that these
are all kinds of ways that we can do that. And one of the acquisitions that we've
taken on is called one and that's actually what we're going to take on as the name of
our entity as a great app. So it's not just a service they do today, it's what can you do
with that app to make it bigger and get more integrated and with people's lives, and
there are so many ways to do that. We think about what people do every day just
managing their own household and memberships and subscriptions and their own
ﬁnances. It's complicated and there're lot of things that come at them and again if
we can make that easier for them, that's what we want to do and just. The beneﬁt for
us of course is that it just get more and more into our ecosystem.
One of the ﬁrst trips I took to India would have been in mid 2016 maybe. First time, I
visited with -- a little bit later in that -- with PhonePe and Flipkart. Some of the things
that they were doing already I came back to Doug and I was like "hey, all the stuﬀ
we've been talking about on kind of helping people integrate with lives, I've seen in
India what PhonePe and Flipkart are doing." We've taken learnings from there and
and though I think they'll be more integration with International over time.
Fintech would be integrated with the Walmart app itself or would you be doing
separately?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think all things are possible at this point. We're obviously going to want to make it
as easy as we can for consumers. We've done as you know a lot in the last couple of
years to try to make our app simpler integrating Walmart pay better into our app.
You have to do that. And so, you would assume that there are things that we can do
to make that simpler as well with ﬁnancial services.
We look forward to learning more about that over the next few years. Sam's Club is
kind of (inaudible) right?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think we have done really well there 10 years ago. Way better now than it was 10
years ago.
It makes the CFO Walmart's life easier when Sam's Club is humming, right? (Multiple

Brett BiggsIt's a big business, a highly cash generative business. The thing that Sam's has done
well particularly in the past few years when Furner was there and now with
(inaudible) there is it's been a great place to develop talent. It's been a great place to
develop technology. Things we've done with Scan and Go there. We've learned from
Sam's about things we could do at Walmart. The way they are interacting with their
member, there's learning certainly if what we're going to do with Walmart Plus. But
they've been a $75 billion business. That seems kind of small because it feels that we
are inside a Walmart. The $70 dollar business that really has been an incubator of
ideas for us and it's been great. I've never seen that business performing as well that
is right now. New members -- as you can get club store, you get more business into
them. They become more dense. It's much easier to run the club. Everything about
Sam's hums as you get volume buildings and I'm really proud of what they've done.
Anything we should think about there about comparisons or -- and obviously Sam's
largest competitor doesn't seem to be slowing down at all?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
No. The Warehouse club business has been a great business. The last 10 years, it's
been a fantastic business and BJ's has done well (inaudible) obviously done really
well, but Sam's is holding its own really, really nicely. It's a great business.
Then back to the kind of puts and takes questions. In International, anything you can
help us think about like going on in International these days? What are the -- how
should we think about upside-downside in 2022?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I like the structure of the portfolio. We've taken some tough choices over the last few
years to to reduce our exposure to some markets. But when you look at the four
largest markets now, I look at all of them and see great potential. Mexico Walmex is
just one of the best retailers in the world. It's a phenomenal business, multi-format,
e-commerce. Gi [ph] and his team are doing an unbelievable job and it's another
one that just hums. So really proud of Walmex.
Canada has been a business that has been a very steady business for us, very high
return business for a number of years. But they're thinking outside the box as well.
Some of the things you hear us talking about in the US with the ecosystem and new
businesses, they're doing the same thing up in Canada and interacting with their
customer in a diﬀerent way. So, I feel really good about what's going on in Canada
with (inaudible) and his team up there.
India, you hear us talk a lot about Indian Flipkart and PhonePe continue to perform
well. It's a very competitive market. We know that it will continue to be competitive,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-09

Brett Biggsbut I like our positioning there with both of those businesses. And so, I think you'll
continue to hear great things about India in our portfolio.
China business. Sam's in China is another one that hums. That is a fantastic business
in China. The super centers have been a little bit slower than the club business and
then we have our joint venture -- with our partnership of JD over there. We are a part
of that company, which has been great from an e-commerce perspective.
So as I look at each one of those markets, I feel good about International being a
higher growth and higher return part of the business.
Okay. I'm going to pause and just see if we are running out of time. Are there any
questions in the audience?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
You asked all the good questions.
Apparently, I did. Anything you want to leave us with that we have not covered, that
you think we should be thinking about?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We always appreciate the interest in the company, I promise you we don't take it for
granted. As we may make decisions, we spent a lot of time obviously talking about
how it impacts our customers, how it impacts our associates, but it's been a long
time how it impacts our shareholders and then how you will be impacted by
decisions we take and obviously we want you to always be impacted positively by
decisions that we take. But we appreciate your patience as we've made investments
over the past few years. I think those investments have paid oﬀ. We're going to
continue to make investments in the business and also believe those are going to
pay oﬀ. I'm leaving the company after 22 years, but I have never ever felt as good as I
feel right now about Walmart. It's in a great position ﬁnancially. It's in a great position
from a competitive standpoint. I feel wonderful about the team and I couldn't be
more proud of the Company.
Is Walmart going to do an in-person annual meeting this year?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
That's something that Kerry is still working on I think. We're always going to -- I think
pick the right time. We feel like it's the right time to bring everybody and talk toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-09

didn't (inaudible). So hopefully you ﬁnd that good, but at the right time we will
always bring everybody together.
