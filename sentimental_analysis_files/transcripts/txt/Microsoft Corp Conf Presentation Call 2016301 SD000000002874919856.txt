{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. My name is Keith Weiss. I run the
software group here at Morgan Stanley and we are very pleased to have with us Amy
Hood, CFO of Microsoft, which obviously I'm sure everyone knows.
Before we get started, I'm going to read a couple of disclaimers from both Morgan
Stanley and Microsoft. So from the Morgan Stanley side of the equation, please note
that all important disclosures, including personal holdings disclosures and Morgan
Stanley disclosures appear on the Morgan Stanley public website at
www.morganstanley.com\researchdisclosures or at the registration desk.
From the Microsoft side of the equation, before we begin, Microsoft may make some
forward-looking statements. Please feel free to make any forward-looking statements
as (inaudible) during this presentation and you should refer to their SEC ﬁlings for
the risk factors related to their business and that's true whether you are here in
person or listening in on the Web.
So with that out of the way, Amy, thank you very much for joining us. It's always a
pleasure having you. So I think you are the biggest company that I've presented to
us far. You have the biggest purview and I think one of the key questions on
everyone's mind is we all believe in the secular trends that are going on in this
business. We all see what's going on in the cloud. We all see some product stories
that we really like. What we are trying to ﬁgure out is whether the spending
environment is sustaining (inaudible) execute on. So I want to take advantage of your
purview as being sort of the biggest company that I have here. What are you seeing?
What are you seeing in terms of IT budgets overall and what people are willing to
spend on software and some of the key technologies other than [ph] software?

Amy HoodJust at a very high level on the macro, I would say we talked a little bit about it on the
earnings call -- seems like a long time ago always -- but China, Brazil, Russia and
Japan, in particular for us, continue to look the way they look, which was -- continues
to be diﬃcult to execute in for various reasons. They are all slightly diﬀerent. The rest
of the world actually looks the same. Q2 was like we expected it to be. That doesn't
mean it was terriﬁc or bad. It just means it was as we expected.
So I don't think I've seen much change in that. But what I would say is, in terms of
spending environment, there's two things we tend to focus on. Mostly it's focusing
on what we control. I will be super clear about that. I know that everybody wants to
ask about the macro. Frankly it is what it is. No matter be it good or bad. So most
days, all I talk about with our salesforce, as well as our management team is focusing
on execution. There's a lot of share to be taken by us. I'm a key believer where we
are in our product cycle. We've got a lot of strong value prop. Feel very good about
our positioning with that and so if the ﬁeld remains focused on doing that and
selling great value as opposed to oil prices, which they can't help on, versus selling,
which they are deeply hopeful on, we are in a good spot.
And secondly, I think in any cycle what's most interesting now and I think there's a lot
of buzzwords about it. But digital transformation at its heart would say we are about
to enter a world -- maybe we are already partially deeply in the cycle -- where OpEx
and COG spend for many companies that historically wasn't tech-based is now tech-
based. So even if your overall spend -- overall budgets at many, many companies in
many, many industries don't grow, the amount that the world needs to spend on IT
to modernize its systems to take advantage of what tech exists in the world is quite
high. The pace at which they do that, we will see. But the value in the return for every
company in the world becoming a digital company is certainly very high.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
The way that all these businesses are sourcing that technology is changing a lot as
well and where Microsoft comes into the equation I think most fully is with Azure
where you really kind of change the dynamic on how we are going to deliver,
compute and storage services on top of that. I think one of the key questions that
investors are trying to ﬁgure out is, within the intelligent cloud, your intelligent cloud
(inaudible), when we think about the amazing growth we've been seeing in Azure,
140% growth in the most recent quarter, is that going to be additive to the overall
equation or is that going to come at some point at the expense of (inaudible) where
you would have sold as a Windows server on premise just shifting to becoming
Azure revenue or is there -- is it additive to the equation?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I think that's why most people -- it's so funny -- while I do get asked those questions
in terms of what's your COG growth and what's your on-prem growth, as a company,
I deeply focus basically on the overall growth. We want to incent cloud selling, of
course. But at the same time for us it's about going at the pace the customer wants
to go. So whether that's on-prem, a hybrid-type story or doing all new data [ph] inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-01
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 13Keith Weiss
Amy Hoodthe cloud and so in the intelligent cloud segment, it was a focus on growing double
digits. That's certainly a share-taker across the board with that type of number.
You are right. Most of the growth -- not most -- some of the growth is from the cloud
and some is on-prem. A lot of the new scenarios I just talked about in terms of the IT
spending macro question you just asked are deeply applicable in this question as
well. There are simply scenarios that weren't possible before that are now possible
with Azure amongst other solutions and that certainly is additive.
Over the long term, if you were to assume, of course, could every bit of compute be
done most eﬃciently in the cloud. Under that assumption, of course, you could say,
yes, the on-prem business goes away. It's a very long curve. Customers have very
diﬀerent time periods on that. We also have on-prem solutions that have a lot of
cloud attributes, whether that's people server that does auto backup. It looks a little
bit like edge of your cloud. And so I think the traditional lines people thought about,
especially for us, I think will be a little diﬀerent and I think that's okay. That's why I
tend to focus at the top and say, if your overall opportunity is growing, your value
prop is good, you can take share. That's why I think we are pretty conﬁdent in our
ability to grow overall at the rates we talk about.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
So we were talking about Azure. We were talking about how it's changing the way
Microsoft delivers services. But the overall intelligent cloud growing. One of the
things you mentioned that I wanted to dig into a little bit is something that I'm really
excited about in the Microsoft story is hybrid cloud. When we talk to particularly
executives at larger organizations, it's deﬁnitely not an either/or. It's not private or
public cloud. It's a hybrid. And when we are talking about the competitive
environment for cloud in terms of the large-scale vendors, (inaudible) services and
Google are the players most people see as really being part of that marketplace.
And I think Microsoft has a real competitive advantage when we are talking about
hybrid cloud. You are the only one of the three vendors that has signiﬁcant
technologies on both sides of the house. How does Microsoft look to leverage out of
that? How do you look to leverage what you've done in on-premise to make hybrid
cloud a reality for your customers?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I think it really starts with -- often times we get asked you really weren't born in the
cloud and how do you overcome that. One of the great things actually about having
a very large and very thoughtful enterprise business already before we made this
decision, which has now been a long time frankly, to begin the push into the cloud
was that we had great coverage globally of sellers, of infrastructure, of talented
technical leaders who can go to accounts and help them on their journey. We've had
a lot of investment in that front for many, many years. And so frankly having
customers that already trust you is not a hindrance in our situation to helping those
customers make the transition in a thoughtful way.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-01

Amy HoodAnd so I think not only am I excited about the value prop, which you talked about.
This is the one I always use just because I think the next releases of SQL will have
many of those attributes which I think will point to many people and say what's my
journey like and you say this is a terriﬁc interim step if you start thinking about the
value of a hybrid cloud where you are going to run what you run and you might run
some things in the cloud. You might move some workloads to the cloud. You may
not. And being able to manage that and secure that environment is something that
we are relatively conﬁdent in our value prop to do to IT and ultimately to the
decision-makers as well.
But I don't like people to forget we have a terriﬁc salesforce, large and very capable
and you've seen them be able frankly to grow revenues substantially in our
commercial business without adding a lot of cost structure. So I think we are really
proud of that and I think that does give us a good structural advantage as we
continue to push new innovations whether on-prem, in the cloud or on a hybrid
model out globally.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Another diﬀerentiation in your (inaudible) you actually have software as a service
components as well, both through stuﬀ like Dynamics CRM online. But also the
biggest (inaudible) franchise out there in terms of Oﬃce 365. So wanted to drill
down on Oﬃce 365 a little bit. The (inaudible) on Oﬃce 365 is a stabilization of that
Oﬃce franchise whereas three, four years ago, I think most people saw a much
bigger threat from stuﬀ like Google given their online status. With Oﬃce 365, you
have a very strong oﬀering (inaudible). You did [ph] a lot of that competitive threat
[ph] from Google because you can get online productivity suite from Microsoft now.
It's really gone further than that. That has now become a real growth opportunity for
you guys. Can you talk to us about how, one, you've been able to expand the base
with Oﬃce 365 and two, how you've been able to improve monetization of that base
with the upsell path [ph] that comes with Oﬃce 365?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Sure. I think it's important ﬁrst of all -- I love your questions because they are always
like we thought you sucked. But you did better than that. So I'm trying hard to
understand --
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
That's basically how we do an upgrade now [ph].
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes, I understand that construct. What I would say generally is we've been growing --
that's why we covered it -- we've been growing our installed base across Oﬃce,
Exchange, SharePoint and what we call Lync or Skype for Business for a couple yearsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-01
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 13Keith Weiss
Amy Hoodnow adding to that and continuing to expand. I tend to think of that as more than
protecting the base. It's growing the base. At the same time -- and that's been
happening -- it's not just at the small business layer, it's also adding seats inside
enterprises for which some of our solutions weren't as applicable and we've been
able to create SKUs that expand that coverage model. And you need to remember,
even if those are at lower ARPU, the ARPU on those seats before was zero.
So I do think when you are able to expand, even if that's at a lower ARPU, if it's a new
seat, that's net new revenue growth for us. I think that's an important concept no
matter what the workload is across what I think of as a broad Oﬃce franchise.
And you pointed -- so if I think about, in life, you want to increase your queue and
increase your pay, right. So we've been able to increase the quantity of seats. You
also over time want to increase your ARPU. The ARPU growth, which you've seen on
the cloud side, has been from an increasing mix of what we call our E3 SKU. But think
of that as a more fully featured SKU, including Oﬃce and the other workloads across
comms, messaging, security, etc. But the good news. And what we are excited about
with E5, is some newer workloads. You mentioned SaaS-like opportunities. We
actually have a few of those. Some of them tend to land in things you think of as an
intelligent cloud. But our mobility solution, EMS, for security and management is a
SaaS-like business in terms of margins.
Our analytics suite, whether that's Power BI or other analytics tools, is a very SaaS-like
margin. That's an E5. Then again some security features are in E5 and then ﬁnally
VoIP is in E5. And so those are really very new markets for us in terms of opportunity
and in the language of P times Q, which I tend to use a lot, it would raise the ARPU of
many of those seats that we've talked about. It's early. We just put that on the price
list December 1 and so while I'm excited about the pipeline and it continues to build,
that ARPU kind of builds over time as we continue to see sales cycles come to
fruition.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
This week outside of just the Morgan Stanley conference, you also have the RSA
conference going on in San Francisco. So obviously a lot of focus on security and it
seems like Microsoft has been increasing focus on security, whether it's through the
security functionality of the E5 Suite. I was reading in the Wall Street Journal, you
guys just set up a new security center to manage security. When we are thinking
about Microsoft and security, should we be thinking about it in terms of this is what
you need to do in terms of almost like a marketing spend in terms of people that
have conﬁdence in your products, or is security a market opportunity for Microsoft,
(inaudible) selling individual products and increasing monetization behind [ph]?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
At the heart of your question, you are really asking do I think of security as a
standalone vertical or do I think of it deeply horizontally. I do think the way we
generally both think about it and the way you see it in our products is more
horizontal than vertical. But that doesn't mean you’re selling motion is not verticallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-01
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)

Keith Weissminded in terms of the value proposition directly to customers. I will give you an
example. Windows 10, especially from an enterprise value prop, one of its strongest
pillars in terms of customer adoption and some of the early success we've seen is
absolutely the security pillar.
And so while I don't say, by the way, buy Windows 10, it's a security business.
Windows 10 deployment in the enterprise often times is about a more secure
operating system. And so I think that's probably a very good example of the
distinction. But I understand the nature of your question. It's certainly an opportunity
when people ask how do I best secure my business. And you can go down solutions,
whether it's Windows 10 deployment, EMS solutions, EDP, of course and then you
kind of go down a list and that solution would look a little like you'd buy a slightly
higher end SKU of Oﬃce 365 to make sure you have the highest security protocols.
You'd buy a Windows 10 Enterprise on top of pro licenses. So in a math equation,
that looks like higher ARPU. But it tends to be a more horizontal and broad approach
as opposed to selling just as a security solution as our major motion.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Shifting to Windows 10, the enterprise side of the equation and the security
side of the equation, (inaudible) in terms of the DoD adopting Windows 10 in a
relatively fast fashion. We tend to think of the operating system adoption taking
place over an extended period of time. How many (inaudible) enterprise adoption?
Are you actually seeing more broadly an accelerated pace of adoption of Windows
Enterprise across enterprises [ph] because of that security functionality?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I don't know that I could tell you precisely what the sole root cause is. I think security
is a reasonable assumption based on the correlation of the feedback we get. Our
enterprise deployment motion, which includes proof of concept, tend to deploy
[ph], which is the standard protocol in IT for this motion, is about 140% ahead of
where Windows 7 was at the same time, which most people think of as a very
successful enterprise rollout plan.
So I feel good about that progress. It's still early. I'm excited. The ﬁeld is focused and
I feel like customers -- there's a lot of pull from customers as well to do proof and
understand the value prop (inaudible). I think we are certainly encouraged by the
pace on that side, especially when you think of Windows 7 as a pretty healthy
benchmark.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. On the ﬁrst side of the equation in terms of the consumer PC market, the
consumer PC market still looks pretty weak out there. The units aren't growing. It
looks like Q1 could be another diﬃcult quarter. How do you guys think about that in
terms of the Windows 10 cycle? I think there's deﬁnitely investor expectations that
Windows 10, a new better operating system, helps spur that marketplace. Is itFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-01
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 13Amy Hood
Keith Weiss
Amy Hooddisappointing that we are still not in consumer PC growth or is this really too early for
that to come back?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
No. We made a decision, which was to provide a free upgrade in place. A free
upgrade in place and we have over 200 million active devices that have been
upgraded means that you have -- there is an impact, of course, on -- if you want
Windows 10, you have to buy a new PC. That's been the motion up until this cycle.
We made an active choice not to have that be the motion, to have more people
frankly become fans of Windows 10 than Windows 8 and the way you build more
fans is to have more exposure. And so I think that active decision probably had some
impact in the PC market. But, at the same time, I think we have more people running
Windows 10 and more feedback, more excitement, more developer excitement
because of the choice we made in terms of the upgrade path.
In terms of the PC market, I don't think my expectation with the PC market would be
much diﬀerent from the markets generally. We are pretty aligned in terms of our
expectations. We've seen some ARPU increases in H1, especially on the consumer
side from some pricing changes we made. So we certainly have a higher RPL and
you've heard other vendors talk about it too. There's been a shift to more premium
devices in the consumer segment as well. I don't think we are the only person who
would say that. And so that does help on ARPUs in terms of overall revenue.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
One of the other interesting dynamics that come out is alternative ways that you are
monetizing Windows 10. I think the most discreet one (inaudible) in terms of
(inaudible) that there is not a search that's going through to Bing from Windows 10
devices well ahead of what you are seeing in previous devices. Can you tell us how
durable do you think that trend is in terms of Bing? Are there other avenues of that
monetization that we should be thinking about that just having that new operating
system will help you get to?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes, I do think -- I most often get asked about Bing or the search business and we are
very proud of the progress in that business. Not only is it proﬁtable. Marginal
improvements have been very good. Our ability to grow -- that's a team that frankly
suﬀered from many negative notes from you and others on their psyche for a long
time and so I'm incredibly proud of the progress they've made. This is an important
strategic business for us. Most people underappreciate what a search business really
is in terms of the competencies and skill sets which they have. It's really the core of
what many people think of as a digital agent strategy.
It's also Cortana, our Cortana analytics product, which is now an enterprise product,
came from much of the technology in the Bing team. So beyond the actual search
growth, which we feel good -- again, some of the search growth is driven by the
choice we just talked about on the Windows side, which was to upgrade the base.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-01
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 13Keith Weiss
Amy HoodUpgrading the base, including the new browser, Edge, which performs better than
IE. So the Edge strategy does encourage search diﬀerences. We've been pleased
with our RPFs and so I feel very good about our ability to sustain that as the active
device number grows in terms of our proﬁtability and frankly share.
Now the second one that you would think about is our gaming business. So we've
talked a lot about bringing gaming to PCs. Outside of search, PC gaming is one of
the most interesting post-monetization -- once you buy a PC, what do people spend
on directly or indirectly? Search is certainly one. Gaming is another. And so our
ability to bring an incredibly strong brand in Xbox to a subscription idea that crosses
from the console to the PC to whatever device you choose to do whether it AR/DR
[ph] as well. You have to think about having that brand in that franchise to expand.
And so it's not truly PC monetization. But that's at its core is to be able to make that
transition with our eﬀorts.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. And the last thing (inaudible) personal computing I want to make sure we
touched on is the mobile side of the equation and (inaudible) a lot of guys had
thought of mobile as a potential Achilles' heel for Microsoft, that you saw Google
and Apple really taking a lot of share away. They are taking the key user interface
into mobile phones with their operating system. But then on the ﬂipside of the
equation, Microsoft has become a lot more ubiquitous on other platforms. Now you
have Oﬃce. That's available on other platforms. Cortana is available on other
platforms. Is mobile -- having that mobile interface, having that marketshare on the
phones itself, is it as important today as it was two, three years ago, or are you guys
more conﬁdent in your ability to maintain that connection with the customer with the
application services despite the operating system?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
We get asked this with relative frequency. Obviously, I tend to focus exactly the way
we talk about our mission and our ambitions in this eﬀort. The mobility of the
experience is what matters the most to us across any screen of any size. And so
whether that be no screen in many instances from an IoT construct, all the way to the
largest screens, which is what we will ship with Surface Hub, which is the big large-
screen video meeting room situation. If the mobility of those experiences are familiar
to you and what you work on your desktop, is what you work on your phone, it's
what you interface with on your wrist, what you interface with on a large screen -- we
feel very good about our relevancy in a market where time is split amongst many,
many, many input nodes, I'll say it that way, interactive nodes, even the long-term
construct as opposed to a shorter-term construct of a phone.
And so I think that remains our focus. It remains where the majority of our investment
is. That doesn't mean that we won't continue -- we shipped the 950, the 950 XL and
holiday [ph] and it said performed as well or better than we thought. But I think the
main focus is strategically the core. It's having the experiences you know and love
whether you are an end-user, in IT or a dev to be across all platforms.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-01

Page 9 of 13Keith Weiss
Amy HoodWe bought Xamarin this week or last. It kind of all blends. It must have been last
week because today's like Monday or Tuesday and so what's important is for that to
say, listen, we are going to be relevant in mobile for dev and for app dev, you write it
once, run it anywhere and have it back up to Azure. That's a great plan conceptually.
I like that. That's what mobile experience is like.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
I want to shift gears to the margin side of the equation. When you were talking about
Microsoft gross margins, it's a complex equation because you have mix shift on one
hand that's the driving force of some lower margin businesses. But the margins
within those segments are improving really well. The area we are seeing the most
improvement in that gross margin segment is on the cloud side of the equation. The
question I get most often is guys trying to ﬁgure out the gross margin proﬁle of
Azure in particular. Where are we today, where are we heading? Help me answer that
question for investors. How should we think about the framework of Azure gross
margins, where they are heading and where they could ultimately be?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I think we talk a lot about our commercial cloud gross margins all up and I think that
is hard. People want the number and then it's confusing once you get it because it's
a blend of two very diﬀerent businesses, diﬀerent lifecycles. So I understand the
nature of the question and why it's hard for people.
On Azure, in particular, we have made substantial progress over the past couple of
years in our Azure gross margin proﬁle. I look and have no confusion about our
ability to continue to improve those margins and I can see very clearly how AWS gets
to where they are and so it seems mathematically correct. The trajectory we are on, I
understand where they are. I understand where we are in our lifecycle. So I feel good
about where we are heading with the Azure proﬁle given our relative size.
And on the Oﬃce 365 side, on the margin, those have been improving as well. It's a
much -- I actually don't want to make it sound old -- but that's a big business for us
already. Those margins have improved substantially as well. They've gotten to the
point now where the improvements will be less, quote/unquote, substantial because
you are getting to the point where you should be. You are at scale. So we've got
room to improve for sure and I'll make sure my team doesn't hear me say they've
done a good job on this one as well. But this is a good progress. But I feel conﬁdent
there's more we can do.
I think you and I have talked about that before as well on the Oﬃce 365 side too
cleanly [ph]. I should also be clear, I think about the Azure business, there's sort of
the IS [ph] cash margin proﬁle. And then there's some of the more SaaS-like
attributes whether that's BI or in analytics -- have very diﬀerent margin proﬁles than
what I would say is store and compute, or looks like store and compute. So I feel
good about our trajectory in all of those.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-01

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Then on the OpEx side of the equation. So it's a slightly more softened question on
that, you guys have done a remarkable job of keeping OpEx under control and
having a really tight focus on OpEx over the past two years. And a question I get is
the durability of that. How long can OpEx remain no growth to very low growth at
Microsoft, or at some point do you guys have to ﬂip a switch and really start to go
into investment mode? So actually question two is when we are thinking about OpEx
growth under pacing revenue growth, how long is that actually durable for?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
It's why I think the new segment and the reason we've gone to operating income in
those segments. So it's more obvious to everyone where we are investing versus the
top line by segment because it's incredibly important. In our intelligent cloud
segment, you saw this quarter we are investing in operating expenses because we
are growing the top line substantially. I have no issue with investing in salespeople
and engineering to expand our TAM and to grow revenue.
That's not -- I would only feel badly if I said no to those. Those are growth businesses
with growth proﬁles and with a large ability to take share. Investing in those
businesses and holding people accountable to that, that is an easy decision.
Everywhere else, we've done I think a good job of moving and saying what can we
do diﬀerently, what can we stop doing, what can we move those dollars better to
have a higher return. Whether the ROI on that dollar is in the wrong place, I can
move it. That's certainly a lot of work we've done over the past 2.5 years. I guess
almost 3 that I've been on the job. And we will continue to do that. There's still room
-- always room to do that and optimize.
There's also continuing to get more eﬃcient with every dollar. How can we take out
layers, how can we move resources, how can we make it easier, how can we --?
Those are also good choices. And it's a pretty nuanced answer and it's why we run
the business the way we run it, which is we want -- each segment has its own
dynamic. Each business needs to be run with that in mind and so I am pretty focused
on continuing to increase the ROI of every single dollar and looking at every
business on its own to see structural improvement and a path to be one or two.

Excellent. I have a bunch more questions I want to get to. But I want to also leave
time for the audience. Any questions from the audience before I keep going?

A - Amy HoodMPC, which is (inaudible) for 265 [ph] and intelligent cloud with incremental growth
driven by Azure. What is the right expectation for margins right now? And I ask that
with this on my mind. Number one, they are lower margin than (inaudible) traditional
over time. But they were scaled [ph] and at the same time, I think Microsoft is a
company that's trying to invest for growth and not just be short-term-oriented. I
don't want to get over my skis on margin expectation.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes, by segment, you are right. Oﬃce is frankly PBP, productivity and business
processes. Yes. It is probably the cleanest one. That business in its traditional form is
95% plus at the growth level. The new business even at scale won't get to that point
even if it's -- I don't know how many businesses in life do. So I don't view that as a
negative at scale. SaaS business, it will be a very high margin business. But it won't
be 95% and so you are right. The blended rate of those will come down. The
absolute dollar growth, of course, can be quite good.
Intelligent cloud has many of those same attributes. It's slightly more complicated
because the delta is larger at the sustaining level. SaaS sustaining margins are far
higher than IaaS and PaaS sustaining margins, to your point the scale margins. So
you are right, it has the same high traditional margin, a lower sustained gross. And so
the outcome of those would be lower growth than PBP. But certainly at the same
level, very good cash ﬂow/real dollar growth as you think about those.
NPC obviously has the widest discrepancy because it's got the hardware businesses
in it. I will use Xbox as an example, a more traditional razor and blade model, all the
way up to the OEM business, which is at the opposite end of the margin spectrum.
And so structurally those have -- you'll see bigger gaps year-to-year and so I think
that's the one thing I would say structurally is the NPC segment has the most
volatility in terms of ability to jump. The others, because they are so annuity-based,
you are not likely, nor am I to be very surprised by the margin curve behind those
businesses.
NPC in addition to having large deltas in its sustaining margins over time also is a
non-annuity business at its core, meaning transactional and recognized at a
transactional basis and so you have more volatility at the revenue line as well as at
the margin line. So that one is. And I understand it for most people, the most diﬃcult
to get the curve -- the sustaining curve on. It doesn't have the same attributes as the
rest of our commercial entity.

Well you've seen us invest OpEx in intelligent cloud mostly. I don't think you've seen
it in the same way in the other segments. Been able to reallocate or reuse most
resources and we've been moving investment from NPC to intelligent cloud

(inaudible) a lot of stock (inaudible) dividend yields close to 3% today and you have
a ton of cash. But all that cash is sitting oﬀshore. So when we put together our
model, we have you guys having to take down signiﬁcant debt to fund -- the US
operations to fund repurchases and that dividend on a going-forward basis. Is that
sustainable? Can you continue to have the (inaudible) of having to take down debt
to fund those obligations?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
We are a AAA-rated company, one of the few that remain. I feel conﬁdent I could
raise money if I was AA+, AA or whatever. I generally tend to think about it -- this is a
decision around total shareholder return and we thought about how best to do that.
Investing in our core is obviously principle number one and running that most
eﬃciently as we can, growing inorganically where it makes sense, returning
dividends at a thoughtful yield and ﬁnally repurchasing shares.
I feel very proud of frankly the progress we've made across all those fronts to
contribute to total shareholder return. It's a big focus for us as a management team,
as well as a broader company priority and I think we've been able to, I think, execute
strong pricing on the bonds and feel very good about borrowing at less than the
yield on the stock after tax and makes good sense. Feel good and optimistic about
our growth (inaudible) trajectory. So I certainly think we've got $14 billion-ish -- look
at Chris to make sure -- left in the repurchase that we committed to get done by the
end of the year. So here we are.

Excellent. Well that takes us to the end of the time. Thank you very much, Amy, for
joining us (inaudible).

Thanks, all. I enjoyed the ﬁre alarm as well.
