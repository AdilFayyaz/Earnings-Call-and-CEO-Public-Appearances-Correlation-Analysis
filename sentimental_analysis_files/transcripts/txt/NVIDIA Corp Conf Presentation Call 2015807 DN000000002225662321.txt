Good morning and welcome to the Bloomberg Intelligence webinar, focused on
regulatory and intellectual property trends in the semiconductor industry.
My name is Anand Srinivasan and I cover the industry for the ﬁrm. On the call with
me are our expert analyst on anti-trust matters, Jennifer Rie; and our intellectual
property analyst, Matthew Larson. All of our bios and research work can be found on
the Bloomberg Terminal by typing in BI SEMI GO.
Let's get started. Few housekeeping notes. Today's presentation will be recorded
and available for playback. At the bottom of the slide window you will notice that
you can adjust the volume and maximize your screen. We recommend that you
maximize your screen for best quality. Feel free to ask questions during the Q&A
panel to the right of the slide. We will address questions at the conclusion of the
presentation. A copy of the slides will be distributed via email following the
presentation, and additional questions can be sent to bievents@bloomberg.net.
Bloomberg Intelligence, for those who are not familiar, provides unique analysis and
context on industries, companies and government litigation, economic, and credit
factors that aﬀect business, all integrated within the Bloomberg Professional Service.
We cover roughly about 130 plus industries and about 4,000 companies globally.
We're a team of 200 plus people, located in New York, London, Hong Kong,
Singapore; and our senior analysts average 20 plus years of buy and sell-side
experience. And again, we're not a broker dealer, we don't provide buy, sell, hold
recommendations, industry and company context.

Page 2 of 17Jennifer Rieregulatory and IP trends, by typing in BI SEMI G. And we also have IDC data and
semiconductor data from SEMI, the industry trade body, on the dashboard.
I thought we talk a few companies that are in the thick of anti-trust and/or litigation
matters or undergoing some signiﬁcant intellectual property issues, companies such
as Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Marvell, Micron; and also talk a little bit about the IP theme,
some of the regulatory trends that are going on in the industry, also talk about
oﬀensive versus defensive patents.
I thought we'd start with Samsung. And one of the things that we have done
extensive work on is the eﬀect of Samsung on Qualcomm. So the company here is
Qualcomm. And by choosing to make its own in-house chips versus buying
Qualcomm's integrated baseband, obviously Qualcomm has lost out on the
Samsung handset potential. But there are some additional factors; one is, Samsung's
balances tip now towards the lower end handsets because of its share loss towards
the higher end handsets, its ASPs also gets skewed downward and there is
heightened competition in the industry from MediaTek as well.
So we've discussed this at length in our dashboard as part of our Qualcomm deck.
So I would urge investors or people who are interested in Qualcomm to go into BI
SEMI.
There's also the consideration as part of its strategic review to try and split the
company into two. We have explicitly suggested that this would create weaker
segments in the long run, perhaps not in the best interest of the company in the
long run. However, in the near-term, these segments might attract attention from
multiple suitors.
So that's the backdrop of Qualcomm, and they recently settled with the NDRC in
China, which would permit their Licensing segment to potentially cross-license and
gain revenue streams from handset royalty make -- or handset makers in China that
use Qualcomm or non-Qualcomm chips. So that's the background on Qualcomm.
With that, Jen, I'll start with you. Paint a picture for us, what are the investigations that
Qualcomm now has underway across the diﬀerent regulatory agencies. What is their
current status with the timing, with the potential ﬁnes and actions as an outcome of
this? You mentioned that EU speciﬁcally could levy the largest sign.
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
That's right. Thank you, Anand. Well, yes, Qualcomm has been under investigation
actually for quite a few years, across the world by competition authorities in Europe,
Korea, Japan and the US. They recently concluded an investigation in China related
to the way they license their standard essential patents, and so that's pretty much
ﬁnished. Now, these investigations are intrusive, they're a distraction, but at the end
of the day, I really only see one potentially having any kind of real impact on the
company and that would be in Europe -- by the European Commission. So let's talk
about what's going on there ﬁrst. Now, what the European Commission has done isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-08-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 17recently sort of formalized an investigation of two diﬀerent kinds of anti-trust
conduct. The ﬁrst one is an older investigation that's been kind of lagging, it's been
around for a few years. It started with some customer complaints related to chipsets
that comply with 3G standards for mobile phones.
And what's been alleged is that Qualcomm is predatory pricing these chipsets. And
what that means is that they price the chipsets below their own marginal cost in
order to capture all the sales, because their competitors can't price that low without
driving themselves out of business, and the concept is they sort of garner a
monopoly and then down-the-road raise the price and recoup whatever they've lost
by pricing below cost. I don't see this really turning into much of anything, because
ﬁrst, these kinds of claims are very diﬃcult to prove and anti-trust enforcers really
don't want to discourage low pricing.
So there's a little bit of conﬂict there with the goal of anti-trust, and also because the
law on predatory pricing is a bit unsettled in Europe and the European Commission
doesn't tend to ﬁne in areas where the law is unsettled.
But the second kind of conduct they are looking at is maybe a little bit more serious
situation. And here they are looking at allegations of exclusive dealing for the sale of
chipsets that comply with both 3G and 4G standards used for mobile devices. And
what is exclusive dealing? In the US, we call it de facto exclusive dealing. And what it
is, is oﬀering such extreme ﬁnancial incentives, rebates, and other discounts on the
condition that a customer purchase all or most of their chipset requirements from
Qualcomm that the customer really has no other choice. It's worth it for them and
they stop buying from competitors, and again, it hinders rivals' ability to compete.
And the reason I think this is more serious is because; ﬁrst, the law on exclusive
dealing in Europe is more clear and more set, and there's more of a precedent, and
it's presumed that this kind of conduct -- if their investigation shows that this is going
on -- is harmful conduct.
And in fact, we have a good example of Intel having been ﬁned in 2009 for very,
very similar allegations in a similar kind of conduct related to CPUs. At that time they
were ﬁned EUR1.06 billion and there were some conduct requirements as well. I
could see, if things bear out that Qualcomm has violated the law, that a similar kind
of ﬁne could be assessed against Qualcomm. Now, talking about timing here
though, nothing is going to resolve any time soon. These things lag on for years - the
European Commission has no statutory deadline. I don't see anything happening
here in less than a year and it will probably be more than that.
And the other thing I think I'd like to clarify is that we often see in the news that the
European Commission can ﬁne 10% of over annual turnover of the company. That
really rarely ever happens and is unlikely to happen here. What happens is, they pick
a percentage between 5% and 30% of the sales of the products for which the wrong
doing is directed. And they look at the severity of the antitrust defense. And in this
case exclusive dealing is considered sort of on the less severe side of antitrust
conduct. So you'd probably be looking at something below 10%. In Intel's case, they
took 5%. They multiply that percentage of sales by the number of years theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-08-06

Anand Srinivasanwrongdoing was ongoing, and basically that's the ﬁne. And the ﬁne can be increased
if the company is a repeat oﬀender; and if the company's involvement is limited, it
can be decreased. So here, I do see some potential for a ﬁne. But again, I don't see
that occurring until way down the road.
With respect to Korea and Japan, I really don't see a lot of impact. Korea is also
looking at abuse of SEPs. It seems that what we're hearing from Korea is that they are
somewhat satisﬁed with what was imposed in China in terms of the change in how
Qualcomm... the royalties that Qualcomm would charge... and it doesn't really look
like much is going to come out of that. Also in the US, we see the US looking at
whether or not there's some abuse of the licensing of standard essential patents.
And here they are looking -- the FTC -- is looking at this conduct under Section 5 of
the Federal Trade Commission Act. They usually use Section 5 when they think the
conduct is, sort of, on the less egregious end of anti-trust conduct. And Section 5 can
but rarely ever ends up with a ﬁne. It usually ends up with a cease and desist order,
simply saying, hey, be reasonable about the way you license these. And really that's
a slap on the wrist more than anything else. So basically, that falls into the "no-big-
deal" category.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
So to summarize; Korea no big deal, Japan no big deal, US ITC no big deal.
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
FTC.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
US FTC no big deal. Do you watch out big ﬁne, potentially, but over a timeline that is
still very, very unclear?
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
Right, that's exactly right on that.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Okay. And so, I want to shift gears and talk a little bit about the NDRC. So Qualcomm
settle with the NDRC, and so this clears the way for its chips to be utilized by Chinese
handset makers to potentially pay then royalty revenues, which they're still in the
discussions to make license agreements for. But let's say -- and also there is potential
change of business practices, but it also has a broader impact on the industry.
Matt, can you talk a little bit about what the NDRC's settlement does from an
intellectual property perspective? Does it provide a framework for other companies
to stay out of its cross hairs?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-08-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 17Matt Larson{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
Yeah, certainly. The NDRC settlement is interesting in a couple of diﬀerent ways. It
certainly provides a roadmap to -- for companies like Qualcomm who are looking to
license their standard essential patents in China.
And by standard essential patents, those are patents that cover various technical
standards. So wireless communications, Wi-Fi, any kind of interoperability issue that
you may have, companies decide on standards that are used across the industry. So
one device can work with or talk to another. And the intellectual property that is
required to implement those technical standards is referred to as standard essential.
And so, the concern -- the general concern here is, how much companies are able to
strangle the market by owning the technology that everyone uses in every device.
And what the NDRC settlement does is, it set out some of terms by which
companies, speciﬁcally Qualcomm here, can license out its standard essential
patents.
There are three main provisions that I think are telling. The ﬁrst of potentially most
impactful is that people who license their Chinese intellectual property or in turn
required to pay the people who take a license for whatever patents they have in
return. So the cross-licensing, almost an obligatory cross-licensing agreement by
which the party who is paying for the license can oﬀset that price with some of their
own intellectual property depending on the size of those two patent portfolios, it
could be a large oﬀset, it could be a small oﬀset, but it's little bit of a protectionist
measure to bring down rates for companies with intellectual property in China.
The second point that I think is important has to do with the royalty base. The way
that patents are licensed is based on some percentage or some rate of a device, of a
component, of a royalty base. And what the NDRC settlement said is that royalty
base to which you can apply your licensing percentage is 65% of an end device.
Previously companies would license, let's say, their Wi-Fi technology for 2% or 3% of
an entire handset or their 3G, 4G LTE patents would be licensed for anywhere
between 1% and 3% of the end device. What China said is, you can no longer use the
entire end device as your royalty base, but only 65% of that. So they're reducing
potentially royalty payments under that model, but it's not quite as extreme as some
of the positions we've seen in other jurisdictions.
For example, in the United States, there are couple of areas where people are
moving from the end device being the royalty base to the smallest component that
practices the technology being a royalty base. So you're moving from an entire
phone to just the Wi-Fi chip, things like that. So this is actually somewhat of a neutral
guide post in the NDRC settlement.
And the third point that I think is worth raising about standard essential patent
licensing out of this Qualcomm-NDRC settlement is the fact that companies are no
longer allowed to bundle their standard essential patents with their non-essential or,
we'll call them their "Cadillac" patents in these licensing deals. So if I've gotFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-08-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 17Anand Srinivasan
Matt Larsontechnology that covers Wi-Fi standards. I have to license those separately than the
bells and whistles that I have in my patent portfolio. What companies are previously
doing is lumping them all together and generating a premium on licensing the
entire portfolio.
The NDRC settlement puts an end to that practice, requiring them to be unbundled.
And depending on how you look at this, it could drive down prices that you're able
to charge for your non-essential patents just because you're looking to attract
licensers. It's going to change the licensing dynamic and the negotiation dynamic
when people are looking to get a return on their Chinese intellectual property.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
It seems like disaggregation of the intellectual properties seems to be the MO of the
NDRC. Is that a philosophical diﬀerence between how intellectual property bodies
across diﬀerent jurisdictions operate or is it just China that's diﬀerent?
I mean, this would dramatically by saying, I mean, the IEEE has the thing ongoing
about, "Okay, pay for the Wi-Fi chip, not the percentage of the phone, pay for what
the Wi-Fi chip ought to be worth." Right. So, and the NDRC appears to be on a
similar tact as well.
So the question is, are there dramatic diﬀerences between the China versus the US
or versus the EU on intellectual property, or is this a China-speciﬁc, NDRC-speciﬁc
thing?
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
There are. I think, that's a good segue into a larger discussion. On this policy,
speciﬁcally, you're seeing the disaggregation on a couple of diﬀerent fronts. You'll
see that delineation in the US because there are contractual requirements that
companies undertake with respect to their standard essential patents to license
those on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. And so, they'll license those out
on those terms and they'll negotiate at separate term for their, we'll call, catalog the
patents.
In China the NDRC is interacted in not letting companies with large standard
essential patent portfolios, bully other companies into taking licenses to the non-
essential features. So it's a little bit more of a protectionist approach. Whereas in the
US, it's kind of -- just kind of built into the system in a way the licenses are
negotiated.
Looking at just generally, how those trends play out, you have to remember that in
China the introduction of intellectual property and strict enforcements and
recognition of intellectual property is a developing area of law in China, there the
bulk of their patent protection has been introduced as the globalization of their
economy has come up, it's a developing area where you contrast that with the US,
intellectual property is baked into the constitution, the holding of private propertyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-08-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 17Anand Srinivasan
Jennifer Rierights and ability to monetize those has always been a central factor to the US
governments and US markets, whereas China is just now getting up to speed. I read
somewhere that someone called China's patent system a vibrant yet ﬂawed system.
And I think that's a good -- it's a good description there, they're getting up to speed,
but there are still some issues. And just from a cultural perspective, the United States
has always been more focused on the protection and monetization of personal
property, where I think the approach from China has been not as focused on those
individual barriers and protections. And so, you see that play out in negotiations in a
way that intellectual property is enforced and licensed.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
So, from a regulatory perspective, Jen, what is the purview of these diﬀerent
agencies and is there a dramatic diﬀerence between how regulatory agencies in the
United States or the EU view it versus than China? We're starting to get a lot more
regulatory agencies involved to the NDRC, MOFCOM. Are there certain factors also
that can be used to judge whether certain industries can be or in companies that are
at risk of regulatory interest?
And last question just to add to that pile is, is it to ﬁne their matters, is it the changing
of practices, or is it IP and structural risk?
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
Well, I think, like Matt just explained with the development of IP enforcement, we're
in the exact same place with the development of antitrust enforcement in China.
Their anti-monopoly law went into eﬀect in 2008; it's really new. The entire anti-trust
regulatory regime is new and developing, and has been called basically a wild card. I
mean, with each new decision, there's something new that occurs, there's some new
approach. And anti-trust regulators study it carefully to see how this history
develops. And I think understanding that, when you compare it to the EU and US
where our competition laws are long-standing, well-developed, backed by loads of
economic analysis, and basically, generally meant for the protection of a healthy
competitive market. In other words, not geared toward protecting companies or
competitors, but geared toward keeping a healthy competitive market where
everybody has a chance to challenge an incumbent and compete robustly. You have
maybe a little bit of a diﬀerent approach so far from Chinese enforcers. There is
some concern that their enforcement has been largely to protect domestic ﬁrms,
again it's been more protectionist from foreign competition. And we've even seen
concerns expressed by Federal Trade Commission chair people, as well as
representatives from the DoJ stating that they are concerned that the way anti-trust is
being implemented in China is a matter of industrial policy rather than protecting
competition.
And so, we have to continue to see how this develops. But if this is how we're
viewing it now and the approach that might be taken, and what we have to expect is
that the industrial areas where the Chinese anti-trust enforcers are going to be
looking at, is where they have the most robust domestic industry. And that's a bit ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-08-06

Page 8 of 17Anand Srinivasan
Jennifer Rie
Anand Srinivasan
Matt Larsonwhat we've seen, we've seen them active in tech, in software, electronics, auto parts
and I think that is what might occur going forward.
And in terms of the ﬁne, the changing of practices or the IP as structural risk, I think it
depends on the jurisdiction. We see jurisdictions that are willing to dole out those
big ﬁnes, including Europe and in some cases US. And I think you see some of these
jurisdictions like China that might be more interested in the changing of practices,
controlling that IP, controlling the royalty rates and things like that, that you really
won't see; you won't price regulation occurring from antitrust regulators in the US
and the EU, it's just really not their practice; whereas it looks like the Chinese
regulators are more willing to price regulate and to talk about what the royalty needs
to be for certain type of patents.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
It seems like the MO of the Chinese regulatory agencies is to protect China Inc
versus and keep it as China Inc versus non-China Inc versus the purview of the EU,
the US regulatory agencies may be to protect consumers against "the big bad
corporations". Is that a reasonable description?
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
For this, looks today, yes it is. I mean, we're still seeing things develop in China and
there's a lot of discussion and cooperation amongst agencies and how -- there's lot
of assistance in the development of this regime, but at least for now, yes.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Okay. Matt, I want to switch gears here and talk a little bit about oﬀensive versus
defensive patents. You've done a little bit of work on the subject. And this has
become a common practice in the tech sector now, isn't it? The gathering of IP for
defensive purposes simply the sword if nothing else annoyance suits, if you may,
versus a serious product development eﬀort?
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
Yeah, that's right. There are number of diﬀerent ways that companies can utilize their
intellectual property, speciﬁcally their patent protection. And you're seeing a lot of
creativity and innovation in this space as well. I think, the oﬀensive versus defensive
distinction is a good one, commonly referred to in the industry, using your patent as
a sword or a shield. When we traditionally think about patents, I think we think
defensively. Your shield. As you get a patent on the products that you came up with,
with the intent purpose of excluding your competition from using that technology.
You came up with the secret sauce, you want to use that in your products, you don't
want anybody else to use it or misappropriate it, you want to reap the beneﬁt of
being able to sell as much of that widget as you can. That's kind of the traditional
defensive portfolio, and that's why companies will invest in R&D, they'll have theirFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-08-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 17Anand Srinivasan
Matt Larsoninventors submit disclosures to the lawyers, who then protect the stuﬀ that's getting
incorporated in the products. That's a strong defensive portfolio.
On the other side, companies are starting to look at these massive investments, not
just in R&D, they also pay annuities to keep up their patent portfolio, there are
maintenance fees. So the question that investors start to have is, what's the ROI that
we're getting out of this asset that's just sitting there. It's a property right like
anything else, can we license it out. And that's where you start to get into using your
patents oﬀensively or using the sword, and either looking for others in the industry
who might beneﬁt from the technology, maybe you license out stale intellectual
property that you yourself aren't using, but somebody else might be able to
monetize for you.
There are some companies that just don't focus on certain market sub-segments. Do
they have competitors there who are using those technologies that they might be
able to monetize? There is always the option of selling oﬀ part of the portfolio and
either getting some kind of license back from the company who acquires the patent,
sort of selling them for a one-time fee. So there are lot of diﬀerent creative
arrangements that companies have gotten into in order to generate some kind of
return on patent portfolios as a property asset.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
I like your sword and shield analogy. We've talked a theme -- about themes a little
bit, we've talked about Qualcomm in a little bit of detail. Let's jump into Marvell. This
is a company that predominantly is in the hard disk drive controller space and also
has a ﬂedgling mobile chip business, speciﬁcally focused on integrated baseband
application processor chips.
It has less than 2% market share against Qualcomm and MediaTek in that space,
both on the 3, 3.5G side and the 4G side, but intellectual property is caught in the
cross hairs of litigation, and against Carnegie Mellon, and supposedly Carnegie
Mellon won huge $1.5 billion case against Marvell, but were back to active a little bit.
Tell us a little bit more about that and where things stand now and what the timeline
and the dollar impact is going to be?
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
Certainly, kind of the high level overview of the overall case is in the early 2000s
Marvell was looking for some design improvements and implemented a media noise
processor that more or less improves the ability to detect media on a hard drive or
detect information. And that's kind of all you need to know about the technology,
really, it's something that was developed in part by professors at Carnegie Mellon.
Long story short, Carnegie Mellon went after Marvell in a patent infringement suit,
wound up steamrolling Marvell in the trial. Post-trial, there were some additional
damages that were tacked on. And when the dust settled, Marvell was looking at a
$1.5 billion verdict and judgment against them. Marvell obviously didn't pay, they
had the opportunity to appeal and question some of the ﬁndings that the DistrictFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-08-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 17Anand Srinivasan
Matt LarsonCourt had made that, the jury had implemented and try to pick the judgment apart a
little bit.
One of the -- a couple of the grounds that they were looking at, the jury awarded
damages based on $0.50 per chip royalty. They basically looked at the last 10 years
of Marvell chips, found that there was an average chip revenue of $4.40 per chip,
they found the proﬁt was about $2.16 and gave them $0.50 per chip, so there's about
a quarter of the proﬁt. That's good, but the $0.50 royalty moving forward gets to be
dangerous as the price of chips drops, that eats further into your proﬁt margin. There
is no percentage there, it's just the hard $0.50. So that's the diﬃcult part of the
judgment, and one that was upheld on appeal.
The appeals courts says, "yes, that is the correct royalty, you're still on the hook for
the $0.50," where Marvell was able to save a large portion of this verdict is, they said
that a large portion of the chips on which they are supposed to pay a royalty never
enter the US. They're manufactured abroad, they're sold abroad, they're
incorporated into chips, or incorporated into products abroad, they never entered
the US, and so they're not subject to US patent protection.
On that issue, the appeals court said there's not enough evidence that was
presented at the ﬁrst trial, so we're going to scratch 900 million approximately half
the verdict and send it back to the court for further proceedings.
So what Marvell is looking at now is a $278 million verdict with the potential to add
on additional damages at the District Court proceeding, but they're also looking at a
$0.50 royalty moving forward. And so, I think what you've got now is a situation
where the parties were way too far apart to settle after trial. Marvell is not going to
pay out 1.5 billion. Now they're in the ballpark of a couple of hundred million.
Carnegie Mellon isn't in the business of putting Marvell out on the streets. They want
a continuing royalty, they want to generate some revenue on their intellectual
property. And so, I think they are at a place now where you could potentially see a
deal with the company as a lot closer.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
The interesting part of the -- part that was sent back was that the IP entity has no
bearing on stuﬀ that is made overseas that is not part of your jurisdiction and sold
overseas. So if it were a US company, it would be the (inaudible) of saying, I make my
products overseas, they're sold overseas, but there is US intellectual property patent
where there somebody were to take that, make that overseas and sell that overseas,
you won't be able to enforce it. Is that a fair characterization?
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
That's a fair character as a notion of extra territoriality that US patents protects under
US law. And so there is a question of how far the contacts to foreign jurisdiction have
to be before you really escape the long arm of the law, so to speak.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-08-06

Page 11 of 17Anand Srinivasan
Matt LarsonAnd so, that's -- it's an interesting question in this case, it's a close call, Carnegie
Mellon presented the argument that because all the design occurred here, because
it's basically everything happened in the US and then they shipped the designs
overseas, those chips should be subject to royalties. Marvell disagrees that under
patent well there is no action that actually occurred in the US that entitles you to
royalties on these products.
And so, we'll see if the battle ones are playing out. It's an interesting question, but I
guess parties frequently don't litigation, because it's interesting to lawyers.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
It's interesting to everyone, the Chinese handset makers on the Qualcomm said,
whether they could escape US intellectual property, because they're making it in
China and selling it in China, maybe they would be not subject to that. Interesting a
bit.
NVIDIA, another company that is -- we have at Bloomberg Intelligence have
coverage of this company, we've done a detailed amount of work, claiming to
undergo a serious transformation from a PC graphics company to a PC gaming
company and that the transformation -- this transformation makes them more of a
gamer and less of a PC company. And as a result, PC weakness should not have
impact on this bill, announced earnings tonight, we'll get a little bit more details on
whether that trend is continuing.
But aside from that, the company has again been in litigation against Samsung,
Qualcomm, ARM, Imagination are all involved. Again, lay out the case for us, timeline
of events, monies involved.
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
Yes. So, at a high level, if you look at the charges on the screen, let me just click,
that's it. You'll notice that NVIDIA is not focused on the mobile space right now, it's
not a segment where they're putting a lot of energy, go ahead and click-through.
And so, going back to the concept of using your patent portfolio as a sword and
looking to see where you can generate additional revenue on your patent portfolio.
One of the options the companies have is taking a look at the technology that you
have protected and seeing if that's in a space where you're not operating and seeing
if you can generate a royalty from the people who are operating in that space. And
that's more or less exactly what NVIDIA has done here is they've taken a look at
Samsung that uses graphics technologies from some of NVIDIA's major competitors.
You've got Samsung sourcing graphics from Qualcomm, from ARM and from

devices is able to generate revenue from three of its graphics competitors in an area
where they're not operating.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-08-06

Jennifer RieSo they approached Samsung, licensing negotiations broke down, and, as usually
happens after companies have reached a standstill, litigation ensued. They are going
after each other fairly aggressively looking to resolve the dispute on a pretty short
timeline based on the litigation that they ﬁled. They've all ﬁled in very fast
jurisdictions where there is a really quick time to trial.
If you look at the case timeline, that's up on the screen now, you'll notice that one
trial has already happened, another one is on the way. There's a jury trial coming up
in 2016 where a judgment will be issued. My feeling on this case is that Samsung and
NVIDIA want to reach a deal, they're just trying to check the scales in favor of one
person or the other. Right now, Samsung has won a couple of key victories, the trial
has already been held, seem to favor Samsung although there is a long way to go
before any kind of ﬁnal judgment or verdict is rendered in that case.
So looking at the timeline, considering that NVIDIA and Samsung have key
representatives meetings in the next couple of weeks to discuss settlements, it may
be possible that they could resolve their dispute before the end of the year, before
these trials start kicking in and ﬁnal decisions. Looking at NVIDIA's overall strategy as
well, they've got a $1.5 billion license with Intel that's going to dry up by 2017. And so,
all indications are that NVIDIA wants to get a deal that Samsung done and then have
time to negotiate with Intel, kind of based in part on some of the royalty rates of
provisions that are in that license. It's not exactly analogous technology, but when
companies negotiate IP, they will get prior license and industry practice.
So I think it's important for NVIDIA to try to get a good deal by the end of 2016. I
think a good goal for the deal is 1 billion probably paid out over typical license of
four to seven years. But if Samsung continues to win and get good posturing in
litigation, you could see that come down based on just the leverage value of those
cases.

Got it. I want to talk a little bit about Micron here for a minute. And reported interest
from Tsinghua University's asset management arm, and this is the end-market
breakdown of Micron, which is a DRAM and NAND leader, it's a consolidating
industry. Jen, can you lead us through us what are the issues here from an anti-trust
perspective or from other regulatory body perspective?
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
Sure, of course. Unlikely to be signiﬁcant antitrust issues here, because they are just
is an insigniﬁcant competitive overlap between them, or at least not enough of a
competitive overlap between these companies, to create issues for anti-trust
regulators. And I think sometimes when we see a statement that there's an anti-trust
problem, it's really just getting confused with where they may have an issue in the
US, which is in front of the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States,
and that is often called CFIUS.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-08-06

Anand SrinivasanCFIUS is an executive branch organization which is charged with identifying potential
national security risks posed by foreign acquisitions of US businesses. This
committee is chaired by Secretary of the Treasury and includes representatives from
a number of diﬀerent US departments and agencies including Defense, State,
Commerce Department and the Department of Homeland Security. So while they
are charged with determining whether foreign acquisitions or investments can pose
security threat, their process isn't particularly clear cut. So CFIUS review of the
Micron transaction seems very likely. And the reason is because where the
transaction involves an acquirer which is a state-owned entity, the transaction is
automatically subject to increase scrutiny, and it usually means a longer-term
scrutiny. And that means under CFIUS, that it would go through full scrutiny, which is
30 days plus 45 days and that is a 75-day review. What can happen is the deal can be
blocked due to national security reasons or there could be a lot of mitigation
measures that are put into place if the deal is allowed to go through. Oftentimes,
these deals aren't usually blocked, but oftentimes what does happen is that the
mitigation measures, which can include some signiﬁcant US oversight of the ultimate
merged entity, these mitigation measures are pretty extreme diﬃcult and not
acceptable by the buyer and what happens is the deal gets abandoned because of
that. So there's some possibility here, but it certainly will get CFIUS to review.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it. Matt, any IP issues here? I mean, this was a little surprising that Micron has a
reasonable IP portfolio for a commodity industry perhaps that's why. But talk a little
bit about IP positioning and why perhaps it deserves a CFIUS review.
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
Yeah. So I think one of the attractive things about Micron is its patent portfolio.
They've got a pretty sizable chunk of assets in the US, just shy of 19,000 US patents.
And their portfolio is actually one of the most cited portfolios in the semiconductor
space. So we are seeing as other companies are referencing the Micron patents
when ﬁling their own patents.
They've also got 4,000 international patents and they have some interesting
arrangements with companies that are currently monetizing patents that Micron has
sold. A couple years ago, they sold 4,000 US patents to a company called Round
Rock Research, which has then engaged in a fairly large licensing campaign, they ﬁle
37 lawsuits on those patents that they acquired. And so there are -- and Micron has
also executed licensing agreements with some large patent portfolios, Round is
being one of them. So they've really got a pretty strong network of intellectual
property assets that could be leveraged by a potential buyer.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you. And we're getting to the end of our sort of the CAN discussion, if
you may. But I did have one question. Jen, why is there a pylon eﬀect from a
regulatory viewing of a particular company, one regulator in one region looks at
Qualcomm. And then before you know it, by the time they have reached theirFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-08-06

Anand Srinivasansettlement, four other regulatory agencies have started looking at it. No fair, right?
Or is it?
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
Well, you might think of it as no fair. I mean, I think there's a couple factors weigh in.
First, we have the increasingly global economy and we're talking about chips here,
which is really a global product; and we're talking about emerging markets - they're
becoming more active anti-trust enforcers, and that's increased the need for
international cooperation. And so, what we're seeing, which I think is actually at the
end of the day a good thing, is a lot of international cooperation amongst the
world's antitrust enforcers. In a particular, the Korean FTC has attacked a lot of
importance to international cooperation; they've entered Memorandums of
Understanding with 15 competition authorities. You see the US, the EU and the
Chinese regulators talking a lot more; they're sharing knowledge.
But what happens with this is that they're all interested in protecting consumers in
their own country. And they talk about what's happening in diﬀerent investigations,
they learn and they're going to look into whether there could be some eﬀect from
the conduct within their jurisdiction. But at the end of the day, the knowledge-
sharing and all the cooperation that's currently occurring might be a good thing in
the long run for businesses, because the more these anti-trust enforcement agencies
come together and become aligned in the way they treat antitrust and business
conduct, the more certainty and comfort that businesses who actually are operating
globally can have with their own conduct and whether it may or may not violate the
law. So, it can be; while the pile-on eﬀect isn't good, it can also be a good thing.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
But which is slightly diﬀerent from the diﬀering agendas from an IP perspective.
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
That's right. I think there is some similarity there. And one of the reasons that you're
seeing similar issues, these companies have similar intellectual property assets in
diﬀerent jurisdictions. They ﬁle a patent in the US, if it's a key patent, they seek
protection globally. Meanwhile, patent laws vary slightly from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction, there are generally some similar approaches.
As Jen pointed out, some countries are more apt to get involved in rate-setting and
the actual terms of agreements where -- whereas others are a little bit more hands
oﬀ or parties will diﬀer to court system to actually get the details nailed down. But
you're seeing a little bit of variability just because of those diﬀerences and patent
law and approaches to how to resolve the disputes.

Anand SrinivasanGot it. Thank you, Matt. Folks, with that, we're at the end of our standardized
presentations. Again, a reminder. If you want to ask questions, use the Q&A panel to
the right of the slide. Just pause for a moment as we look at Q&A.
Matt, while we're doing that, can you talk through AMD for a quick minute or two,
their patent portfolio, positioning, thoughts on AMD.
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
Yeah, certainly. So, AMD has a pretty interesting portfolio. Right now, it's sitting at
about 5,000 patents, I think, just a little bit fewer than 5,000 patents with another
1,200 to 1,500 in the pipe. There are a lot of AMD's patent activity happened right
around the 2000s, it's kind of 1997 to 2002 era, and has been somewhat stagnant
since then, a big portion of it is in electric digital data, maybe another 20% is in
semiconductors.
It seems to be a pretty unique portfolio that they've been able to monetize fairly
successfully. In 2010 Samsung paid $283 million payment essentially to settle a
dispute. They entered into a no royalty-bearing cross-license with Intel. But as part of
an overall litigation strategy, Intel wound up paying AMD a sizable chunk for
dropping the lawsuit, although it's not explicitly a royalty, I would imagine that there
is a large portion of that is attributable to the intellectual property. So, AMD has kind
of developed a, by no means, small but sizable strong patent portfolio that has been
able to monetize fairly successfully.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it. Jen, given a lot of the M&A interest by Chinese state-owned entities of late in
their desire to build a semiconductor food chain in the homeland. Can you explain
when CFIUS gets involved versus other agencies and what other regional clearances
might be required?
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
Well, CFIUS is going to get involved any time, a non-US entity is acquiring US assets.
Now, they don't always review, but they are going to step in and they are going to
take a look. If they think that it warrants review, they will review and impose
mitigation measures. So they're always going to be involved where it's essentially a
non-US entity acquiring or investing in US assets. As far as the other regions, it's
going to depend on whether tests are triggered. And when I say that, each of the
diﬀerent jurisdictions have their own sort of framework for when a transaction has to
be ﬁled with antitrust authorities and the authorities given chance to review, and they
have to usually reach certain thresholds; they have to be of a certain size or a certain
amount of assets within those countries or certain amount of sales in those countries.
And so, it just depends where the products in question are being sold.

Jennifer RieGot it. And Matt, since we're talking about semis, can you review Intel and Apple sort
of portfolios really quickly and give us a skinny on those two?
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
Yeah, certainly. So, Apple is taking an interesting approach, I mean, they've got a
large investment in intellectual property. They've got a lot of patents, they fashion
themselves as a big innovator and certainly have done a lot of innovation. Today,
nobody is disputing that. Apple, in terms of monetizing their portfolio, takes an
interesting approach, because they're frequently a target of intellectual property
lawsuits. I don't like using the pejorative, but patent trolls go after Apple, because
they just want a quick payday.
And so, Apple is less concerned about monetizing its patents in the oﬀensive sword
way and more using them as a shield. Apple has taken a lot of eﬀorts to reduce
royalty payments. When we're talking about standard essential patents, Apple takes
the position that royalties should be lower, it should be based on a smaller
percentage of the device or the smallest component possible, because higher
royalties dig into its pocket. So while Apple has been a huge innovator, it's also
made a lot of steps that are adverse to say Qualcomm or Ericsson and Nokia, or
some of the companies who are really looking to monetize their innovations.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it. And there's the recent passing of the law on "IP trolls". Does that help the
industry in that regard or does it make it worse for licensors or owners of IP?
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
So I think it's yet to be seen, They're still kicking around what the provisions with that
bill are going to be. We've got a good team at Bloomberg Intelligence who is
actually following kind of the most recent activity surrounding those bills. It's going
to be tough anytime you adjust the patent litigation system, there are winners and
losers. And it really kind of depends on what that ﬁnal bill is going to look like. I think
that it's a little ambitious to think you'll be able to pass a litigation bill, a law for
lawyers that controls litigation. It seems suspect that it's really going to deter a whole
lot of business practices. But we'll see when the actual legislation comes out.
{BIO 18267478 <GO>}
Yeah. So I also wanted to raise this we're talking a lot about IP and tech here, and I
wanted to raise something else. The Federal Trade Commission covers a lot of
diﬀerent industries and areas in antitrust and they sort of move... there are diﬀerent
times when their focus moves... they focused a lot recently at healthcare industry. But
at an event in April with anti-trust enforcers from all over the world and FTC
enforcers speaking on panels, one of the things they said is that they are moving into
looking at standard essential patents and they're making that a priority.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-08-06

Page 17 of 17Matt Larson
Anand SrinivasanAnd I think that, that tells us that any company that owns and licenses standard
essential patents, it's going to kind of come under the looking glass by the US FTC
going forward in the next couple of years. They made it really clear that. This is
something they're focusing on now.
{BIO 19014506 <GO>}
Yeah, something they're focusing on, you're seeing a lot more court cases about this,
a lot of companies are rather than negotiating kind of behind closed doors there,
they're going to court and saying, "Alright, we want to know what our reasonable
royalty is", they're willing to ﬁght about it, you're seeing -- there is a big dispute now
between Apple and Ericsson that focuses on this issue. Ericsson and TCL, there are a
lot of -- it's kind of an emerging area of low. So I think parties are looking on the
court side to ﬂesh that out and really see where the chips are falling.
