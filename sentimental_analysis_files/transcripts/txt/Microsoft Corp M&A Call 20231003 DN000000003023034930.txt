Welcome to the Admins, Partners, and OneDrive users joining us from around the
world today. I'm Jeﬀ Teper, President of Collaborative Apps and Platforms here at
Microsoft, and I'd like to thank you for helping inﬂuence and shape OneDrive over
the years from its origins as a simple cloud storage solution to the ﬁle sharing hub it
is today.
The ﬁrst iteration of OneDrive provided a simple way for you to store your ﬁles in the
cloud and then access them on any device. And as online versions of Oﬃce apps
and Microsoft 365 were developed, your needs around ﬁle storage began to grow
beyond simply storing and accessing content. In response, we built the second
generation of OneDrive, which added sync, sharing, collaboration, and security, all
that help you work seamlessly in client apps and online. And today, OneDrive hosts
trillions of ﬁles with nearly 2 billion more added every single day. In the time I just
said that, about 200,000 more ﬁles were added to OneDrive. That is a lot of ﬁles.
And of course, underpinning OneDrive's tremendous growth and performance is
SharePoint, the platform that powers not only OneDrive, but all the content
experiences in the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, including Teams, Stream, Loop,
Whiteboard, and more. And with SharePoint as our foundation, we can bring the
best security, compliance, governance, performance, and collaboration to all ﬁles in
Microsoft 365, where they live on a SharePoint team site, a Teams channel, or in a
personal OneDrive folder.
And as we look to the future, we see the world of ﬁles changing yet again and we
need tools that can help us adapt to this new reality. Gone are the days when our
ﬁles reside solely on local PCs or within a single ﬁle share. Today, what truly matters
to us extends beyond individual OneDrives and personal computers. It now spans
our colleagues' OneDrives, takes access to SharePoint document libraries, travels,
attachments, and email invites, gets exchanged through Teams chats. And so, to
address these modern challenges, we're now introducing today the third generation
of OneDrive. And with it, OneDrive becomes your solution for all your ﬁles and allFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-03

Page 2 of 10Arwa Tyebkhanyour content you work with no matter where it lives. It's adaptable and
personalizable to how you choose to ﬁnd and organize what's important to you.
Another reality of how we work today is that collaboration has taken center stage,
becoming the standard rather than the exception. So, sharing documents and
remotely accessing your ﬁles and apps needs to be as natural as sending emails.
And so, to that end, we're going to show you how easy it is to use the new OneDrive
to share your ﬁles and collaborate with your partners inside and outside your
organization. We'll also show you how you can stay productive within the apps you
rely on, especially while you're on the go.
For admins, we understand how this dynamic era of distributed work has only
increased the challenges of security and manageability for your organization's ﬁles,
particularly in the realm of cloud storage. You need tools purpose-built for this
evolving landscape. So here, we'll be taking a look at new enhancements to
OneDrive that better help you with the security and governance of your
organization's cloud data.
Finally, leveraging the latest strides in generative AI, we can unlock perhaps the
biggest leap in productivity yet. It should be eﬀortless to locate, organize, and
synthesize the most crucial pieces of information regardless of where it lives. And so,
today, we're very excited to show you what we think is the biggest change in content
collaboration yet, Microsoft 365 Copilot in OneDrive.
So, are you ready? Let's dive into the next evolution of OneDrive.
Hi, everyone. My name is Arwa, and today, I'm excited to introduce the new and
refreshed OneDrive experience. With this experience, OneDrive is now your one-
stop shop to ﬁnd, access, and work with all your ﬁles no matter where they live. It's
faster than ever. It's personalized to you and it's here today.
Let's start by seeing how the OneDrive you know and love is being visually updated.
It's built on Microsoft's new Fluent 2 design language, which has a consistent and
approachable look and feel. One of the goals with these updates was for your ﬁles
and folders to take center stage. To that end, we reduced the number of containers
and overall geometry on the screen. We revamped the typography to improve
overall legibility. And we simpliﬁed our commanding and navigation surfaces,
making OneDrive easier to use.
I'd like to welcome you to your new OneDrive Home, where we make it easy for you
to get started with your day. This experience is designed to help you easily ﬁnd and
access your ﬁles across the ecosystem with AI-powered ﬁle recommendations in the
For You section. Our goal is to surface the right ﬁle at the right time right at your
ﬁngertips. And we're making a snap to quickly get back to a ﬁle you used recently
right from your recent list in home. Whether that ﬁle lives in your OneDrive, has been
shared by a colleague, or lives in a Team or document library, it's all here. You canFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 10quickly ﬁlter this list using the ﬁlter pills or by entering a name or owner for the ﬁle
you're looking for.
Now, we know that the types of content that you work with has evolved over time
and we're here to cater to all your content needs. OneDrive is growing to support
modern content types like loops, lists, videos, and more in addition to all of those
classic ﬁles we often use, like Word, Excel, PowerPoint or PDF documents. You'll
notice how Home guides you to ﬁnd the ﬁles that are likely important or relevant to
you in the moment. In the For You section, ﬁles are shown with clear actions and
clicking on them can open the ﬁle and take you directly to where your attention is
needed.
We know you often create ﬁles and folders directly from OneDrive. The new feature
we are pumped to share will help make these experiences even better. This is our
powerful Create tool with beautifully designed templates. This Create experience
helps you get started, creating high-quality professional-looking documents directly
from OneDrive. When you want to start a new ﬁle, you can choose between creating
a blank document just as before or you can select from a set of templates to
jumpstart your work. Hover over these templates to see a quick preview and conﬁrm
that the template is right for you.
We're also bringing in personalization, enabling you to express yourself. Now you
can choose the color of your folders, which will help you stay organized and
personalize those important projects. And when you share a folder with others, your
color choice will be reﬂected with those that you shared it with. After all, who doesn't
need a little more color in their life?
We know that ﬁle collaboration happens in many ways across diﬀerent apps and with
ﬁles stored across diﬀerent locations. We also understand that this ﬂexibility comes
with complexity. Here is how OneDrive adapts to your collaboration needs and helps
you get back to your shared content.
First, we've updated the shared view. Here, you'll ﬁnd all the ﬁles that have been
shared with you regardless of whether someone sent the ﬁle over email, shared a
link with you in Teams, or sent it directly through the Share dialogue. As you saw in
Home, you can ﬁlter this list by folder or ﬁle type to ﬁnd the content you're looking
for. This view includes ﬁles across both internal and external tenants. And of course,
it is critical that your content remains safe and secure at all times, and towards that,
only ﬁles that you have access and permission to will ever be presented in this view.
There may be times when you're looking for a ﬁle, but you can't quite remember the
exact name or speciﬁc details about it, but you can remember exactly who sent it to
you. For those of us who recall ﬁles in a people-centric way, OneDrive is introducing
a new people view. This view focuses on the people you work with and helps you
quickly ﬁnd ﬁles you're working on together. Rich thumbnails and activity previews
help keep you up to speed on collaboration activity, removing the guesswork in
ﬁnding the right ﬁle. Of course, you'll be able to ﬁlter and ﬁnd the right person. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 10Gaia Cariniif you want to quickly get back to them again, you can also pin those people to the
top of the view.
Our new Meetings view is all about your collaboration content across your meetings,
from the one-oﬀ syncs to those that are regularly scheduled. For instance, you might
have a recurring weekly meeting. This view shows all the ﬁles that were shared in that
meeting over time and all past recordings. This view can also help you get ready for
your upcoming meetings by making it easy to ﬁnd pre-reading materials that were
sent with the original invite. It's a super handy view for those of us who spend a lot of
our time collaborating with others in real time.
I have a ﬁnal view that I am excited to share today, and it's one that we've heard so
many of you ask for across industries and organizations. We're soon bringing a
Media view to OneDrive, where you can access all your photo and video assets in
one place. And with these new views in OneDrive across Home, Shared, People,
Meetings, and Media, we hope that you ﬁnd that navigating, ﬁnding, and accessing
the right ﬁle is faster and easier than ever.
Let's talk about how you can better keep those important ﬁles so you can easily get
back to them later. Over the last few years, we've introduced the idea of favoriting
ﬁles in Oﬃce to make it easier to get back to them. Now, with OneDrive, we're
bringing this capability to every ﬁle across all content types and everywhere you go.
When you see a ﬁle or folder that you want to get back to, you can mark it as a
favorite right there and get back to it from the favorites list at anytime. And your
favorites ﬁles would show consistently across the M365 ecosystem, including in
Teams, File Explorer, Oﬃce apps, and more.
That's not all. While favorites makes it easy to get back to ﬁles from your favorites
view, we know how many of you have a need to organize content within your
existing OneDrive folders. With the new OneDrive, we're making it easy to create a
shortcut to a ﬁle. This means, when you see a ﬁle that was shared with you, you can
add it as a link within any folder in your OneDrive, making it easy to collect ﬁles for
your projects regardless of where they live.
Thanks for joining me on this tour of the new OneDrive experiences designed to
help you ﬁnd and organize your content with ease. Next, Gaia will walk through how
OneDrive simpliﬁes your sharing workﬂow and enables you to be more productive
with your ﬁles no matter which apps you prefer to work with in the Microsoft 365
ecosystem.
Thanks, Arwa. I'm thrilled to share the latest innovation to make it easier than ever to
work with your ﬁles in OneDrive with a familiar and coherent experience across all
the apps you use.
Let's start with sharing ﬁles. We want to make sharing and collaboration with
OneDrive as simple as possible, which is why we've completely revamped the ShareFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 10dialogue across all of Microsoft 365. This new simpliﬁed sharing experience is more
secure, faster, and easier to use than ever before. We've streamlined the sharing UI
to allow you to focus on the people that you want to share with, and made it faster to
copy links to your clipboard. You can then paste the link into a Teams chat or a
channel, where you will see a beautiful preview of the ﬁle.
We also know that being able to manage permissions on shared content is critical.
Our new Manage Access experience makes it easy to see the people or groups who
have access to your ﬁles and manage their permissions with more granular control.
We've also streamlined how you can share ﬁles with external co-workers, while still
respecting your organization's sharing policies. If the default link type doesn't work
for external people, don't worry, all you need to do is quickly conﬁrm, and we'll take
care of the rest for you.
Next up, for users who work with ﬁles in the OneDrive and SharePoint web apps or in
Teams, we've heard the need to be able to open and edit non-Oﬃce ﬁles in desktop
applications. With Open in app, users can easily open a PDF, a CAD ﬁle, an Illustrator
ﬁle, or any other ﬁle type, and it will immediately launch into the desktop application
ready to edit. After making a change, the ﬁle syncs up to the cloud, leveraging the
OneDrive sync app. And when you open it on the web, the latest version is already
there.
When working with OneDrive, fast experiences make you more productive. We are
bringing the best-in-class performance and speeding up your everyday interactions.
This includes loading OneDrive, navigating around the app, sorting content, and
scrolling through ﬁles, no matter your connection speed. With these changes, you'll
get consistently fast experiences even on slower connections, allowing you to
accomplish your tasks more eﬃciently than before.
What's more, the new web experiences Arwa showed earlier will continue to work
even when you're oﬄine, thanks to the power of Sync. You'll be able to launch
OneDrive in the browser, see all your ﬁles, and even open local ﬁles, all without any
Internet connection. With these transformative changes, we're also bringing you
Files On-Demand to the browser. You can mark a ﬁle as Available oﬄine so you can
access it right from the browser, even when you're working without any Internet. Any
changes you make while you're oﬄine will be later synced up to the cloud when
you're connected again.
Of course, we're bringing all the innovation we've shown you today across the
Microsoft 365 ecosystem so that you can access your ﬁles in a coherent and familiar
way no matter where you are, whether that's in Teams, in Outlook, in Oﬃce, or
Windows. Today, we're excited to announce that the Files app experience accessed
from the left navigation in Teams is being upgraded to leverage the OneDrive app.
This will ensure Teams users beneﬁt from all the performance improvements, new
views, and feature enhancements that we've shared today. In Outlook, we're soon
adding the OneDrive app to the left navigation as well. This will create a simple and
convenient bridge from your mail and calendar to your ﬁles so that you can save
attachments, open and share ﬁles, all without having to switch apps.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-03

Page 6 of 10Sesha ManiFinally, in File Explorer in Windows 11, we've brought you the latest Share dialog
improvements to make collaboration easier; the Home view with AI-powered ﬁle
recommendations, favorite and recent ﬁles, surfacing the most relevant content at
your ﬁngertips; and the new Details pane with the ﬁle activity, related ﬁles and
conversations to help you ﬁnd what you're looking for. And this is just the beginning
of bringing all of the power of OneDrive to Windows users. I hope you're as excited
as I am about all the innovation to make OneDrive simpler than ever to use across
Microsoft 365.
Next, Sesha will walk through the latest features to ensure security and governance
for all your content in OneDrive and SharePoint.
Thank you, Gaia. All the awesome features outlined earlier are going to help you
create, store, and collaborate with content seamlessly in your OneDrive. But we are
not stopping there. We also empower admins with tools to secure and govern all this
content in OneDrive accounts so that they are protected from intentional or
unintentional overexposure. With our new set of admin capabilities spanning across
actionable insights to advanced access policies, you can now secure and manage
speciﬁc OneDrive accounts at a whole new level.
Let's start with Collaboration insights. As the name implies, these insights can help
you identify user-centric patterns of collaboration and sharing across your
organization. For example, quickly glancing over the top OneDrive collaborators
report, you identify that Megan Bowen collaborates frequently. If you want to get
into the details, you can download the detailed report to dive into what sites and
users each top collaborators are working with.
Now, some of these top collaborators may work with conﬁdential documents. You
may want to ﬁne-tune the access requirement for them so that they don't
accidentally leak sensitive information. With a simple one-step conﬁguration of
granular control access policy, you can now achieve that. Let me show you how.
Here is Megan's OneDrive. You can see that she can sign-in with the single-factor
authentication. But given that she often works with conﬁdential ﬁles, you may want to
ensure she goes through multi-factor authentication, like one-time passcode or
Microsoft authenticator application. To achieve that, all you have to execute is one
easy PowerShell command, setting the authentication context with multi-factor
authentication as required for her OneDrive. And voila, now, when she tries to access
OneDrive again, she gets prompted for a one-time passcode, which is sent to her
phone.
Note that she is prompted only when she accesses her content in her OneDrive, and
this applies not only to Megan, but also to all her collaborators who access shared
ﬁles from Megan's OneDrive. Now, that is granular access control, and it protects
content without disrupting productivity.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 10Jason MooreNow, as an admin, you may wonder who has access to Megan's shared ﬁles in
OneDrive and is there a way to control who, both internal and external, can access
her shared OneDrive ﬁles. Well, now there is. We are excited to introduce restricted
access control policy for individual OneDrive accounts. And let me show you how it
plays out.
Take the scenario where Megan accidentally over-shared her ﬁles with Daniel, who is
an external user. You, as the admin, notice this over-share via Collaboration insights
and want to ﬁne-tune access to Megan's shared ﬁles such that only internal users
have access. You can now do this instantly through SharePoint PowerShell by simply
enabling restricted access control policy for a speciﬁc OneDrive account and
indicating the security group that you want to allow access to. Anyone that is not part
of the speciﬁed security group will lose access immediately. And here we go. Daniel,
the external user, can no longer access the shared ﬁles from Megan's OneDrive.
Now, if your organization has recently gone through a merger or acquisition or
divestiture, you may have a need to move OneDrive accounts from one tenant to
another. We have an answer for you. Yes, you heard it right. You can now move
OneDrive accounts across tenants. Today, we are thrilled to announce cross-tenant
OneDrive migration. Let's see how it works.
The ﬁctional scenario is, PharmaTech acquires part of Contoso HealthTech, and
Shobha is one of the users in Contoso HealthTech that gets moved to PharmaTech.
You create Shobha as a user in PharmaTech, and then with one simple commandlet,
Start-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMove, you can instantly move or schedule the
move of Shobha's OneDrive. Now, sit back and watch the magic happen. As the
move gets scheduled, it completes and her OneDrive is moved across the tenants.
Looking at the URL, notice that Shobha's OneDrive has been migrated to
PharmaTech. One additional gem here, which is, what happens to sharing links. All
the existing sharing links will continue to work with the new redirect site feature.
What a seamless experience for the collaborators. So, that was a whirlwind tour of
new capabilities in security and governance for OneDrive.
And now, Jason will show you how OneDrive is set for another transformational
change when it comes to ﬁnding, organizing, and experiencing what's important to
you. Jason, over to you.

Thanks, Sesha. From what we've shown today, OneDrive has come a long way since
its humble days as the simple cloud storage solution Jeﬀ spoke about earlier. It's
evolved over the years to meet your needs in this ever-changing technology
landscape. Fast forward to today, with the latest AI innovations, we have another
exciting opportunity to transform the way you interact with OneDrive. So, let's spend
a few moments to see how AI and OneDrive will make it intuitive, insightful, maybe
even a little magical for you at work and in life.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-03

Page 8 of 10Your photos are your memories and ﬁnding photos should be as easy as
remembering the joyful moments they capture. The people we care about are some
of the most important photos we have, which is why we're enabling you to search by
people in OneDrive. With your permission, OneDrive will group your photos by your
friends and family. You can easily put a name to a face. OneDrive makes it easy to
see all of the photos of the people you care about right in one place.
Next, we want to show oﬀ our new photo search experience powered by OneDrive's
semantic understanding of your media. This allows you to search and ﬁnd photos
using natural language. And that's just a fancy way of saying, you can type what
you're looking for, and OneDrive is going to ﬁnd it. And guess what? It works with
people too. So, you can quickly ﬁnd any moment of the people you care about. With
OneDrive, your memories are just a query away. We're starting to roll out these
photo AI features to consumers in limited preview today. We're looking forward to all
of your feedback and bringing you new ways to make the most of your memories.
As you just saw, the upcoming changes in OneDrive make it easier than ever to ﬁnd,
organize, and collaborate on the ﬁles you care about most. When Microsoft
introduced Copilot earlier this year, you saw how it gives you superpowers when it
comes to creating documents, presentations, and working with spreadsheets in
Microsoft 365. Today, we want to show you how Copilot and OneDrive can give you
new superpowers when it comes to ﬁnding the right content, staying organized, or
even getting caught up on useful information.
Let's start with the Search. Since Copilot understands intent and context, you can use
natural language to get exactly what you're looking for. What's even better is that
Copilot can help you answer questions on the set of documents to help you stay on
the ﬂow. For example, instead of opening a document to conﬁrm whether it relates
to your search, you can simply ask Copilot to summarize the key takeaways. And
Copilot can answer questions not just on a single ﬁle, but multiple ﬁles, even an
entire folder or document library. But searching for ﬁles is often only the start.
Copilot understands intent, so it can even recommend next steps.
Since Copilot understands you may beneﬁt from ﬁnding these ﬁles easily in the
future, it suggests adding these ﬁles to a new folder. And this is the fun part. Because
you're in a folder with ﬁles related to a project, Copilot can recommend other ﬁles
and content related to this project that you can then choose to add to this folder. In
just a matter of minutes, what started as a simple search has resulted in your very
own knowledge library on this project. And whenever you're ready to collaborate,
Copilot's awareness of other people in your team that's working with you, make you
sharing a truly magical experience.
Let's pause here and switch our point of view for a minute. Now, imagine this folder
was shared with you, but not just this folder. Since your last login to OneDrive, there
have been multiple ﬁles that have been shared with you, along with new revisions
made by others to your documents, new comments that need your attention, and a
lot more. In this world of active collaboration, staying on top of your ﬁles can feel like
a never-ending task. Well, not anymore. The new catch-up feature on OneDrive willFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-10-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 10Jeﬀ Tepergive you a daily digest that helps you quickly glance at summaries of new ﬁles that
have been shared with you, changes that have been made to ﬁles you've shared with
others, a summarized look at new comments, a prioritized list of documents,
upcoming meetings, and a whole lot more.
Copilot intelligently organizes these updates based on context and relevance. So if
you have an upcoming meeting where a document will be a key part of the
discussion, you'll see that at top. And Copilot can help you with follow-up questions,
suggested actions on these updates, and give you the ﬂexibility to do a deeper dive.
This is a small sample of what we mean when we say we want to transform the way
you work with ﬁles. We're incredibly excited about this journey and we can't wait to
share more new features with you over the upcoming months.
Back to you, Jeﬀ.
