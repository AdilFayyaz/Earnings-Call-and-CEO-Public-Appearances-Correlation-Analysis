All right. Good morning. Before we begin, I do have the safe harbor statement to
read. Microsoft may make some forward-looking statements during this presentation.
And you should refer to their SEC ﬁlings for the risk factors relating to their business.
And that's true whether you're here in person or listening on the web. So Ron, thank
you for joining us here in Park City this year so -- and being for the ﬁrst track here to
kick oﬀ the sessions. So I guess, maybe just to kick things oﬀ a little something for
everything -- everybody in the room here, maybe if you can introduce yourself, give
us some of your background, tenure at Microsoft, et cetera.
{BIO 15128633 <GO>}
Great. My name is Ron Markezich. I just hit 20 years at Microsoft last Friday, did a
number of jobs. I was -- started in IT, started as a customer at Microsoft -- inside
Microsoft for about six years. I became CIO at Microsoft. Started what we now call
Oﬃce 365 14 years ago as CIO, grew that business in incubation for about six years,
ran our U.S. enterprise sales force for ﬁve years. And now I'm responsible for our
Microsoft 365 commercial business. So Microsoft 365 would include Oﬃce 365,
Windows and Enterprise Mobility plus security suite.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Great. Awesome. Well just to get things started, too. I mean, Microsoft has obviously
gone through a lot of change over the past few years. From your perspective,
obviously having been there 20 years now, if you could provide a little bit of color on
the evolution of the company and the culture and the impact Satya and Amy have
had on the direction and culture of the company.

Page 2 of 10Q - Philip Alan Winslow
A - Ron MarkezichYes. I think the -- if I look at when Satya came in, one of the ﬁrst things he did was get
us grounded on a mission that was fresh and new for the company. I think if you look
at when Microsoft started in a mission being PC on every desk and in every home,
we largely accomplished that mission. I think there's a period of time there where we
didn't have that North Star that we're all marching towards. And so getting us
grounded on a mission to help every person, help every organization on the planet
achieve more was something that's super helpful because it's aspirational. It was
focused not on revenue and making money, although that's super important, that's
why we're in business. But focus on making people's lives better and making
organizations more successful and really focusing from inside to outside how our
products and solutions help people. That was a big one. The other one was really a
focus on diversity and inclusion in Microsoft. We hear a lot about that. And tech
companies are starting to share data. But it was more beyond just the data, just how
do we integrate diversity and inclusion into our products, how do we have a mindset
that our job at Microsoft is to make sure everyone can participate in this movement
that's happening in this world, this new tech industrial revolution. And that was core.
You might have seen recently something like even the Xbox Adaptive Controller to
help people with disabilities use the Xbox. Or even if you look inside our products
that have core accessibility capabilities, you add a picture into PowerPoint, you have
alt text in there for people that are visually -- can't see the picture. And so that was
core for us just in terms of the mindset of the company. The third one I'll say is you
might hear a lot of this Microsoft runs on trust, especially as we move to cloud
services, which we've been in the process of literally for 14 years. Trust is such a key
component because you become part of that organization, the supply chain, delivery
chain, part of how they operate. And so things like our Cybersecurity Tech Accord.
We rally tech companies around getting some policies and principles, the principle
that privacy is a fundamental human right. Some of the stances we've taken in --
publicly, in the courts, have been all part of making sure customers can trust us and
that we have the principles and policies in the company that we treat customers'
data that it's their data. They own it. We don't monetize the data. We have a business
model that focus on customer success, not our sole success. So I think those 3 things
would be key.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Great. Then obviously, being a veteran at Microsoft, 20 years, maybe you can talk
about how your approach has changed to speciﬁc business or speciﬁc market.
{BIO 15128633 <GO>}
Yes. I think it's interesting, having been a customer at Microsoft early on and now
being part of the organization that serves our customers broadly, I think the biggest
change at Microsoft in terms of how I've approached it is really around customer
signal, customer listening and reaction to customers. When we're purely a software
company with ship cycles of three years, it was really hard to get customer signal.
When I was CIO, we used to sit down with Bill Gates once every other month for 2
hours just to talk about, as CIO, as a customer of Microsoft product, how could our
products get better, which is a horrible signal, customer as one. Now as we move to
cloud services through Azure, through Microsoft 365, you get such great signal from
customers across segments, geographies, industries, et cetera. And what -- the
change has really been around our ability to be agile in that customer feedback. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-04

Page 3 of 10Q - Philip Alan Winslow

Q - Philip Alan Winslow
A - Ron Markezichthe way in which Satya has reengineered the engineering organization and improve
the agility and the time to respond to feedback is the biggest change I've had where
if I looked at 10 years ago, I'd say, "Oh, we've got this thing we've got to do. It might
show up in our product that ships in three years." Now we're looking at, "Hi. we need
to make sure we support ethical walls for ﬁnancial services companies in Microsoft
Teams. Boom, it's on the road map." And we deliver that very quickly.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Great. Maybe you can touch on from a sales perspective with customers, just about
the general tone in the relationship between your customers and Microsoft, sort of
what are you hearing, what's the feedback been from customers?
{BIO 15128633 <GO>}
Yes. It's -- ﬁrst of all, the Microsoft Cloud is something customers will say -- if they're
not there, it's not a question of whether they'll go there or not. It's a question of
when. Certainly, our penetration on Oﬃce 365 and Azure has been remarkable,
especially in our commercial large enterprise segment. And you might see in the
past, 10 years ago, customers will say, oh, I don't know if I want to sacriﬁce security by
moving to the cloud. Now they say, I've got to move to the cloud to get the secure
environment I need. The mindset certainly has changed. We saw that with some of
the hacks that happened that were largely publicized 5 or six years ago. The whole
industry shifted to saying, you know what, Microsoft Cloud is more secure. I've got to
get there to help my security posture. We see a lot more in terms of customer tone,
how do I invest more in my employees. If you look six years ago, you might have
seen customers say, how do I squeeze the turnip even more, get more productivity
out of people. How do I take that laptop and instead of a 4-year life, make it a 6-year
life? And how do I get a cheaper laptop? That certainly has changed where the
expectation of employees -- they have great tools, they have great hardware, great
services. And customers -- our customer, the industry has to invest in the employees
to keep them, retain them, attract those employees because their expectations for
tech is much higher. And so getting them the best and the latest. The third thing I'd
say is every company is a tech company. And so they're all searching for how do I
avoid disruption. Even companies in the -- what they thought had huge moat to
recognize that I'm going to get disrupted. And it's not going to be the CEO that has
all the answers. How do I tap into the ingenuity of the entire organization?
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
One more high-level question before we drill down on O365 and Microsoft 365. But
last year, you went through a big sales re-org at Microsoft. And I'm wondering if you
could talk about sort of the core tenets of the change. And how has that changed
the dialogue with customers, particularly in your area of focus, O365, M365?
{BIO 15128633 <GO>}
Yes. There's a few things we need to do. We needed to get deeper technical
expertise in our ﬁeld as our product portfolio has broadened. I mean, you look at
Azure, Azure is a compilation of about 50 diﬀerent services. Microsoft 365, we run
from taking over -- allowing you to run your PBX in the cloud to set a securityFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 10Q - Philip Alan Winslow
A - Ron Markezichcomponent. So we needed to have deeper expert -- technical expertise in the ﬁeld.
We also needed to organize more around industry. So many of our solutions
become tailored by industry diﬀerently. If you look at our Dynamics business, that's
certainly diﬀerent by industry. But even Microsoft 365, there's a number of ﬂavors by
industry that customers will want to implement. And we need that expertise in the
ﬁeld around that. We also changed our comp model signiﬁcantly to comp much
more around usage at our customers. So top-down, there are some people that are
100% comped on usage. Even our people that are comped on revenue have an
aspect of usage. We didn't want -- we want to make sure we didn't just sell licenses
that we actually were incenting our people to get customers to use the product that
they bought and owned. Then we did a lot around our partners to better segment
our customers. So it was clear where we were hunting and selling with Microsoft
employees and where the white space was with the partners. Then we had
coordination across those. Then last one we invested -- we've been investing, we'll
continue to invest quite heavily on is our inside sales organization to carry our -- to
help with our breadth of customers and to partner with those partners that sell to
those breadth of customers.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. All right. We'll come -- we'll circle back to M365 in a second. Let's drill into the
commercial side of Oﬃce 365, which obviously has been a great success that you
just mentioned here for the company. And if I ﬂashback to the 2017 ﬁnancial Analyst
Meeting, Amy talked about an 8% CAGR for Oﬃce commercial installed base from
ﬁscal '15 to ﬁscal '17. Now in my opinion, that's a sign of TAM expansion. We were
talking about that type of unit CAGR. What's really driving that sort of net new user
growth that we're seeing because of Oﬃce 365, the piracy, new users, ﬁrst-line
workers, et cetera, what is driving that? And how do you think about that going
forward?
{BIO 15128633 <GO>}
Yes. Predominantly, new customers, new users. And we always get this question,
when we meet with folks like you, it's like, hey, how can Oﬃce 365 grow so much? I
thought your penetration's pretty high. And it's amazing how much white space still
exists out there for Oﬃce 365. And I'd look at it at least on the user side in a couple
of perspectives. One, certainly the ﬁrst-line workers, focusing on housekeeping staﬀ
here at the hotel, folks that work the slopes up in Deer Valley or Park City, people
that picks grapes in Napa Valley. There's a whole set of ﬁrst-line workers that never
had technology. Depending on how you measure them, it could be 2 billion to 3
billion people in the world that are employees or workers of some sort that really, for
the most part, don't have technology. We've really focused our engineering eﬀorts
on meeting the needs of that population. In the past, we had tried to just take what
we oﬀered for information workers and made it cheaper and slim down for these
ﬁrst-line workers. And that didn't work at all. What we've done now is we've actually
created capabilities in the service speciﬁcally targeted at those ﬁrst-line workers.
Things like shift capabilities, shift sharing, HoloLens to help people with support in
the ﬁeld so they can tap into an expert back at headquarters, a number of those
scenarios. So that's TAM, that subscriber expansion and the population that frankly
never subscribed to anything from Microsoft. Then there's customers. We've made
great progress in certain segments. But there's a lot of room to go in otherFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-04

Page 5 of 10Q - Philip Alan Winslow

A - Ron Markezichsegments, certainly emerging markets, smaller businesses, customers that tend to
not move as quickly. We've made great progress just recently in the large banks, the
G-SIFIs where there have been holdouts because of regulatory reasons. We've done
some things in the U.S., having private clouds for government so that we can meet
all the U.S. regulations. We've done things like data centers that are go-local in
certain countries so that government in those countries feel more comfortable
moving to Microsoft Cloud. We've done things in the emerging markets using an
app called Kaizala that allows you to essentially communicate with an organization
through just cell numbers. They don't even have to be in the directory, just the
phone number, you can reach out to those. So we're doing solutions to meet these
segments that haven't yet moved to the cloud to give them a compelling reason to
move and to meet their needs both regulatory as well as their business process
needs.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Now Oﬃce 365 commercial growth has been outgrowing seat growth as obviously
you guys have been reporting. To me, that shows obviously the mixup in the mix up
in the skus you're seeing -- and the questions I get from a lot of investors and I like to
ask you about is about how do you think about sort of ARPU growth going forward
and that migration up to the higher end SKUs Oﬃce 365? Like where are we? How
do you think through that?
{BIO 15128633 <GO>}
We're in early days. We launched Microsoft E5, our E5 SKU, which would be our
premium SKU, which have advanced security capabilities, advanced compliance,
have a lot of advanced voice capabilities for instance like moving your PBX to our
cloud with our phone system and in Power BI as well. That, we've seen great uptake
that -- for that for larger customers. And great early days. But the opportunity is still
ahead of us on E5. That's helped -- certainly helped our ARPU growth. There's a lot
of focus on E5. But even if we take it down to E3, we've seen a huge move from
customers that kind of bought in at a stand-alone workload like Exchange Online or
our E1 workload moving to E3. And so what our strategy is, is to help a customer
meet their needs by getting into Microsoft 365 at one of our levels and then move
them up the chain. And we've seen a lot of success at moving up that chain, either
from E1 to E3, from stand-alones to E3 and now E3 to E5. But there's still a lot of
room to go, getting the customers to E3, getting new customers, new users as well
as getting them up to E5.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
And speaking of new features, let's talk about Teams. And wondering if you could
talk about just a momentum you're seeing there. And how do you think about sort of
continuing to diﬀerentiate Oﬃce 365? Obviously, Teams being a sort of recent
addition to the package. But how do you think about sort of continuing to
diﬀerentiate Oﬃce 365? So Teams and then kind of the go forward.

Page 6 of 10Q - Philip Alan Winslow
A - Ron Markezich
Q - Philip Alan WinslowYes. Teams is super important to us because it is the hub for teamwork in Microsoft
365. It's the one place to go. And it bridges the gaps across generations. So a lot of -
- like looking at this room, a lot of us probably start our day in Outlook, look at our
email, calendar. I could tell you, my kids never go to Outlook. I'm sure your kids
never go to Outlook. And they -- your kids love probably things like these GIFs and
videos and stuﬀ that I think is a waste of time. But that's a large way in which they
communicate. Microsoft Teams brings that together. So you have generations
working together in a productive way, which is so needed today because if you look
at the workforce, the generations that exist are teaming together. And they have very
diﬀerent styles in which they use technology. Not only that, it's that hub for teamwork
that brings everything together in Microsoft 365, whether that's your OneNote, your
online meetings, your one-on-ones, your artifacts from a meeting that go back in
time. If you join a team, you don't want to -- how many of you have joined the team
and said, hey, send me all those emails from the past so I can get up to speed on this
new team I'm on. Now you join the team, all the content for that team and the history
of that team, they're available to you. When you leave the team, you never and no
longer have access to all that information on that team because you lose access to
that site, Microsoft Teams. So it's super important for us that hub for teamwork. But
it's also a new way for people to work. A lot of times, you'd say, hey, Oﬃce 365,
you've got Word, Excel, PowerPoint. I'm kind of stuck in my old habits. Microsoft
Teams gets people out of their old habits and helps them work in a modern way. All
these things combined -- Microsoft Teams, actually less than two years in the market,
where actually it's the fastest-growing business application in the history of
Microsoft. The growth has been phenomenal. The responses have been
phenomenal. Customers like Accenture, I'll give you an example. They made
Microsoft Teams available, didn't advertise it, didn't do any internal marketing. Now
they have about 145,000 users every month on Microsoft Teams, just organic growth.
So we see that quite common. We've also made a version of Microsoft Teams
available for free because we see it as a great on-ramp into Microsoft 365 for
customers that don't yet own Microsoft 365. They can start using Microsoft Teams,
getting real value out of that. There's not -- it's not a trial. There's not an end date.
They could stay in there. But we're seeing the conversion rate to subscribers be very
high for folks that use the free version.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. I actually speak millennial. And I only communicate with my team in emojis
(inaudible) animated ones on Skype for Business.
{BIO 15128633 <GO>}
A modern way...
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
I'm a fan of the vanishing ninja, a big fan of that. But let's transition over to Microsoft
365. And I'll ask a couple more questions then open it up to the audience and
pause. But back at Build, I thought it was really interesting because I'd describe it as
almost sort of a reposition of Microsoft 365. It's not just simply sort of a bundle,
Windows 10, O365 and enterprise mobility and security. But rather it's a platform for
developers and it blends web application and -- web and traditional applicationFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 10A - Ron Markezich
Q - Philip Alan Winslow
A - Ron Markezichenvironment. So how do you think -- how are sort of -- inside of Microsoft, how you
think about 365? And how do you sort of position that as a platform?
{BIO 15128633 <GO>}
Yes. We really -- Microsoft 365, to be fair, we started it a number of years ago as
enterprise cloud suite. And it was just a packaging thing. You get a 5% extra discount
if you buy the full thing. The uptake was huge. We were super surprised at how
strong the uptake was with really no marketing behind it, not a great name. It was
confusing what it even was. But then, part of this, when I talked before about kind of
the outside-in view of the culture at Microsoft, we realized the reason customers
were buying it as a suite wasn't really for the 5% discount, although they'd gladly
take that. It's because that's how they used it. Every customer uses Oﬃce 365, EMS
and Windows together. They don't like to buy them as separate packages.
Historically, we as a company had engineered these 3 diﬀerent products. And so
then we sold them and license them as 3 diﬀerent things. So when we started as a
license and packaging thing, we actually changed the whole company over a year
ago to engineer and organize around Microsoft 365. So we have 1 engineering
leader that owns all the engineering in Microsoft 365. First time we've had a
Windows and Oﬃce together in 1 engineering organization. And we're really taking
kind of that outside-in view. We prioritize work across Windows, Oﬃce and EMS. We
ensure when we open up a go-local data center, it supports Windows Oﬃce and
EMS. Our update policies are consistent across the 3. And it's all designed the way
around customers and how they would take these products and give them to their
users and how their users would use them.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
One last question. And I'll open it up to the audience. But when you talk about
M365, how does it ﬁt in with your cloud strategy and the whole strategy around
digital transformation? And sort of how is this tracking? And in particular, one of the
questions I get from investors, too, is the end of support of Windows 7 is coming up
in 2020. How does this ﬁt in with Microsoft 365?
{BIO 15128633 <GO>}
Yes. Well ﬁrst, when we talk to customers, it was really with digital transformation.
And we have our cloud, with Microsoft 365, Azure and Dynamics as the lead cloud to
help customers digitally transform. Microsoft 365 is how you can empower your
employees and really help them tap into the ingenuity of those employees to help
you stay competitive. The way -- if I hit -- kind of hit just Windows 7 end of life really
quick. One of the parts that Microsoft 365 is helping customers do is really take
Oﬃce and Windows and make them cloud delivered. So allow you to take Oﬃce
365 ProPlus and have it update your clients across whether you're using iPad, iOS,
Android, Windows, Mac, give you those updates then. So that we can manage those
clients on you and make sure you always have the latest and greatest. Windows 10,
same thing, allow you to have us manage the clients so you always have the latest
and greatest. We see a large shift for customers that are on Windows 7 with that
coming up to end of life using that to shift to what we could call the modern device
or modern desktop. So they always have the latest and greatest across Oﬃce,
Windows and EMS on those devices and desktops.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-04

Awesome. I'll pause for a minute to see if there are any questions from the audience.
Just go ahead and raise your hand, otherwise, I'll ﬁnish oﬀ my Q&A. All right, we're
getting people revved up. It's still a little early here. They're still getting caﬀeinated.
So I'm going to ask one of my favorite questions. It's about Edge. And so anybody
that's read my stuﬀ knows I'm a big Edge guy. So we've written obviously a lot about
it. But talk about how Microsoft 365 ﬁts into the whole intelligent Edge, intelligent
cloud strategy.
{BIO 15128633 <GO>}
Yes. It's core to both. When you think about Oﬃce 365 ProPlus or Windows 10 or
Windows Defender ATP, which gives you security on your client, that is all about
Edge, getting signal from the Edge, making sure you've got the latest capabilities
from a productivity perspective. But also ensure we have signal to help customers
with their security posture, even help customers with their -- measuring the
productivity and eﬀectiveness in the way they use the tools. We did a -- we have a
secure score. We give every customer a secure score, tells them where they can
improve their security posture. And we get that by understanding what's happening
at the edge and what's happening at the core. That could include (AD) signals,
Windows signals, Oﬃce signals, signals in Azure. And so we take that altogether,
give them a security score. We'll do the same thing with the productivity score. We'll
launch a productivity score for customers so they can see individually how can I be
more productive. And also as a manager, you can see in an anonymous way, how can
I make my team more productive. You can see as an organization leader, how do I
make my organization more productive. And that's all signal we're getting from the
intelligent cloud and intelligent edge that come together.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
All right. And sticking with the theme of Intelligent Cloud. Obviously, EMS reach, I
think, was 88 million in Q2 in terms of installed base. One of the things that Amy
talked about is like, hey, look, it's still tied to human. So to speak, versus sort of the
open-endedness so to speak of Azure. But how do you think about sort of just
penetration of EMS inside of that O365 installed base? And sort of like, I guess,
where we are on the life cycle?
{BIO 15128633 <GO>}
Yes. EMS, you have to think about EMS as EMS E3 and EMS E5. EMS E3, we see
superstrong attach rate to Oﬃce 365. And what we do see is most customers
moving to Microsoft 365 because they all want Windows 10 for those users. So great
-- and Microsoft 365 in a short period of time is actually a multibillion-dollar
business. And so great growth and attach there. EMS E5 is also critical, though. And
with EMS E5, we have a lot of security capability that expands, things like advanced
threat analytics that I've mentioned, signal that allows you to anticipate where attacks
might be coming to address things before an attack happens; has Microsoft Cloud
app security. So you can look at all the cloud apps that are used within an
organization, manage those and control those. It's the age-old problem of a CIO,
how do I manage all this shadow IT? Well now, shadow IT, you don't even need aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-04

Q - Philip Alan Winslowserver. You just sign up for cloud service. You can use Microsoft Cloud app security
to manage all that shadow IT cloud app that exist with your environment. And so
what Azure AD Premium P2, they allow you to have policy for GDPR to set automatic
classiﬁcation on documents. So super popular, especially if customers look to meet
GDPR requirements. So all of that, we think of EMS E3 strong attach to the Oﬃce
certainly per user. But lots of headroom with EMS E5 because it's earlier days there.
The last one in terms of per user, we are experimenting with some things that are not
per user. First is we have something called Microsoft Workplace Analytics that allows
you to take the Microsoft Graph and understand how your organization works
together, the connections, the interrelationship. We actually don't do that as a per
user. We do that as more of a value-based pricing. And so we'll come out with more
things that are more value-oriented pricing versus just being tied to per user.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Cool. Last question for you here, too, is kind of the forward -- I guess, road map sort
of Microsoft 365 because there are a lot of areas I can imagine -- sort of you kind of
continue to pivot the suite into, whether it be identity access management, message
security, virtual desktop, et cetera. It seems like there are multiple areas. How do you
think between sort of building some of it organically, acquiring versus partnering in
some of these? Like where do you draw the line?
{BIO 15128633 <GO>}
Yes. It's really a balance. I think we do all 3. And we don't -- we would not say 1 of the
3 is a priority. They're all important. We've got a number of partners that integrate
with Microsoft. If you just look in Teams and look to add in new apps into Teams, lots
of partners out there and continuing to grow. If you look at even security, lots of
partners that we work within the security space that we integrate with Microsoft 365.
But at the same time, EMS E5, we made some important acquisitions to build out
that product in terms of the security capabilities. And they were all of these --
Microsoft Teams, we built in organically. And we felt that was a super good decision
because we feel really good about how that ﬁts in with strong integration across all
of Oﬃce 365 from day 1. So it's really a balance across all of those 3. And they're all 3
very important.

everyone, for coming. And thank you, Ron for kicking oﬀ the track 1.
