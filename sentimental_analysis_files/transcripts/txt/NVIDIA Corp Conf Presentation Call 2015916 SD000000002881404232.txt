Presentation
We have Colette Kress, the CFO of Nvidia on stage. No slides today, we're just going
to go straight into Q&A. Again, if you have any questions, just raise your hand and
we'll get a microphone over to you but please do wait for the microphone so that
those on the webcast can hear the question. So Colette, ﬁrst of all, thank you very
much for coming out.
At the highest level, I think the question that I have is people still historically think of
NVIDIA as being very much linked to the PC market, which at times in the past was a
positive, but deﬁnitely now adds some headwinds.
The growth rate of the Company, though, kind of has shown that there's a
breakdown of that relationship. Talk a little bit about the transformation that you've
seen in the Company over the last couple years and how you think that
transformation continues going forward.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. So correct, NVIDIA has deﬁnitely had a great presence in the
overall PC industry for many years. But several years ago, our expansion into other
unique platforms has really been our focus.
We right now concentrate on four key platforms as we move forward, still
concentrated on one unique uniﬁed overall architecture or technology as our overall
single focus on visual computing and the GPU is in the heart of what we do.
But we enter into four diﬀerent markets, one of those being gaming, gaming for the
PC, gaming for mobile. The second one being enterprise where we focus on design
rendering and top-end applications within workstations and also virtualization of the
GPU.
Our third market is high performance computing and cloud, a very key market where
the GPU is used in an accelerated mode for many parallel applications or high
performance computing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16

Unidentiﬁed SpeakerAnd that our fourth one, our mobile GPU associated with automotive industry and
bringing together both the infotainment systems within cars and also the future of
ADAS.
So those are our four key markets. And what you've seen in this year is really a
decoupling from the underlying PC market. The ﬁrst half of the year, the PC market
wasn't strong, actually quite a decline that we saw in between the Windows 98
upgrades and what we saw with Windows 10 coming out in the second half of the
year.
But what we saw was our business continue to be extremely healthy over this.
Overall, ﬁrst half of the year, our revenue growth was about 5%. But if you
concentrated just on those four key markets for our future, those four markets are
growing more than 25%, with one of the key markets growing which would be
gaming.
Now, the gaming that we do enter into is gaming for the overall PC. But it's a
diﬀerent kind of piece. It's actually a platform play. Our GPU is generally looked at as
the underlying platform to take place in PC gaming where people are buying that
GPU for the absolute experience that they want for their PC gaming.
PC gaming is a very healthy, exciting market right now. You've seen it move to an
entertainment segment. You've seen it actually move almost to a sport. You see
coliseums ﬁlled with overall gamers. And we have a very, very strong relationship
with those gamers as we surround the GPU with the overall ecosystem of what we
put together.
So we are working with game developers. We're working to understand better what
the games want to put in there in terms of features. And that works seamlessly with
the GPUs that we've come out.
So so far year to date through FY16, our overall gaming segment is growing more
than 50%. Yes, still based on a PC underlying platform. But the overall growth is
more than 50%.
So if I split the gaming segment just for reference just kind of 55%, 60% total
revenues --
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
That's correct.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16

Colette Kress-- for the Company. Then you have the OEM side as well, which is kind of the more
traditionally linked part with PCs, which is down a bunch. But even if you put the two
together, you're still up, by my math, kind of 8%, 10% year over year, at a time when
PCs are down by about that same amount. So it's still netting out positive.
Between those two segments, how do you delineate between the gaming PC versus
OEM?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So I think it's an important thing to look at, of our GPUs that we sell into the
market for gaming, that is mostly done by an adding card board. That isn't installed
into general-purpose PCs.
There is even a case with many of the ones that go into gaming notebooks that they
are marketed and they are put out there as a gaming overall notebook.
But what we can tell is we're not here just selling down to the OEMs. We have a
complete community with our overall gamers. So we can see the gamers as they
essentially use GeForce Experience to download the drivers. We can see the games
that they are playing. And we can have that overall community eﬀect with them,
which has really allowed us to just to diﬀerentiate from both competition but also to
really engage with the overall gamer in terms of what they want.
So a lot of it is focused on the full value that you are getting with the GPU. You can
have a great gaming experience at possibly $99, $100 in terms of buying a GPU. But
you can also even have an exciting experience in terms of gaming with some of our
higher end GPUs that can go up into the $800 to $1,000.
And if there's the high-end gaming boxes that the OEMs make themselves, the
Alienwares, et cetera, how is that categorized? Does that go in --
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
That would deﬁnitely be a gaming --
Okay. So you put it in the gaming side.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
-- gaming GPU, yes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16

Colette Kress
Unidentiﬁed SpeakerHow do you look at -- you've talked about the gaming experience, these big gaming
events where there's millions of people watching, it becomes like bigger than
watching a sporting event or a launch of a new movie.
How do you view the gaming TAM growing versus the success you've had coming
from market share? How do we think about the TAM versus the share?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
A great question. It's actually still quite a large expanding TAM because it associates
with not just the GPU but all of the community around it in terms of the games that
are there.
We've done a great job in terms of expanding our overall share. But we've had a
good percentage of that share for some time.
But what we're working on is adding new gamers because it becomes a social
experience. It becomes that your online games are with a group of your friends, they
are key strategy games that you are playing together. And so what happens is the
addition of new gamers really just come from being part of that social platform.
We're also looking at areas where broadband experience, to play games, you need
broadband experience, which is not necessarily available everybody, everywhere in
the world equally.
So we see new parts of the world coming online to do PC gaming as well. That has
also been a key expansion for us.
Then we also see the expansion as the performance desire that is fueled by the great
games that are coming to market need a better, higher value GPU as well.
So right now, if we think about just the GPU market from a discrete, you can look at a
TAM of overall $4 billion. But if you think about overall gaming, the need for mobility,
the need for cloud for the gaming experiences of the future, easily that could be
higher than $50 billion, higher than $100 billion in terms of the amount of gaming
that's actually occurring.
And a question I often get is where does this actually occur around the world, kind of
the geographic dispersion of it. And part of that also comes in because I think China
will be part of the answer, with consoles now being supported in China, what sort of
impact -- so the ﬁrst is the geo. Then the second is, what sort of impact on whatever
percentage you give to China will consoles being adopted there potentially have?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 16Colette Kress
Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Colette Kress{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. We actually have a very strong market in almost every regional area around the
world. So what we've seen for at least the last eight quarters is each one of those
regions be strong. That means the North American market, the European market, the
Asia-Paciﬁc. And China market.
So where normally you may have one or two key actual regions, all three of our
regions are quite strong and a good representative of our overall revenue.
But each market is actually diﬀerent because there's quite a bit of cultural diﬀerences
around the world. In the U.S., we game on just about anything because we have so
many capable diﬀerent products that we do.
But PC gaming is still one of the best experiences that they will have. And we have a
very strong presence and, therefore, very strong growth.
Now, in China, the overall PC platform is the heart of the home. It became the piece
that not just was used for gaming but used for general purpose within the home.
You also had iCafes to be a very big social experience in China where people
actually go to meet their friends and play hour by hour in terms of games there.
So we just have a unique installed base in China that we have established over many,
many years through there.
The emergence of consoles, although, yes, new in terms of legally in some or parts
of the world such as China, not necessarily new to Chinese people. So the PC
experience is still so ingrained in such a large installed base and is such a better
experience and the content of what is available for PC gaming has just kept it
extremely alive in China, even with the legalization of the console.
Two last questions on the gaming side and the PC aspect of it. I guess the ﬁrst one
would be that OEM side, the part that's not the focus of the Company. And it's
somewhere around 10%-ish of sales, roughly, maybe a little bit less. What's the
expectation for that going forward?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So what he's referring to is when you look at our gaming GPUs, we can tell,
again, by how they are using those GPUs that it is primarily for gaming. We will still
and continue to sell into a general purpose enterprise PC or a general purpose
consumer PC. And in the discrete.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 16Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Colette KressWe'll compete against others in the market. There's a lot of diﬀerent options in terms
of a general purpose PC. It has amounted to probably less than 10% of our business
right now as a whole of the Company, where even if you had looked as short as
maybe two to two and a half years ago it was substantially a much bigger piece of
our business.
So our transformation related [ph] to that and establishing to these key markets have
been key.
Where it goes, it's hard to say. I think there's still a question of does the overall PC
start to stabilize -- stabilize around zero growth without the declines that we have
seen?
We'll still compete in that market. It's not to say that it's not our strategy. Of course,
we see it as a viable business. But we're looking at it as let's make sure we see the
proﬁt that we need from that business.
And I guess the last question is more a kind of a nearer-term business question.
But in your last quarter, which was July, you had guided business to be weaker,
which really didn't surprise people too much given what was going on in PCs. But lo
and behold you actually came out and were ﬂat instead of down, say 10% or 12%
sequentially. And the gaming segment was what made up the diﬀerence.
What surprised you in that? Because that was going to be conservative. But that's a
pretty wide delta from the beginning to the end of the quarter.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So when we had started the quarter guidance back in May, we saw what
everybody else saw, not necessarily focused on the PCs. But we focused a lot on
where the macro environments were.
If you recall at that time, the European market had seen such a quick rise regarding
the FX exchange rates. That really changed the overall buying behavior in that
region. And not necessarily understanding how those markets would react to the
things that we had seen, we had heard and were watching quite carefully. A lot of
concern in terms of the slowdown of the economy and particularly in some parts of
China to say how would that aﬀect our overall businesses?
So we still believed our overall gaming market was healthy and very strong and our
overall presence in there. But we really were thoughtful in terms of thinking about
some of these macro conditions.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 16Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Colette Kress
Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Colette KressSo what happened? So when we actually ﬁnished the quarter, yes, the gaming
market was healthy. But it was a lot healthier than when we had expected, even with
those market conditions around there.
The gamers wanted to game. There were some great exciting new games. There
were some great things coming on the horizon. They saw the great infrastructure and
innovation that we had put out there in terms of the new GPUs with our Maxwell
lines that we had launched.
They had started testing the upcoming Virtual Reality that is going to be right around
the carter [ph] in Q4 and Q1. And they gamed.
So we were very excited with the performance. Everything else was about where we
had expected. The gaming was just tremendously more stronger than we thought,
which really, really demonstrated, yes, that transformation had worked. Really being
an end-to-end player on that gaming experience has allowed us to really decouple
from the overall PC market.
So why don't we take a chance and move outside the PC area or the gaming side to
the enterprise side, which I think is about, depending on your quarter, 15% to 20% of
sales. That's where Quadro resides and I believe GRID --
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
GRID.
-- will be there as well. It's been a little bit weaker year over year of late. I think it's
mainly enterprise spending-related. But talk a little bit about what's been going on in
that business now and some of the growth vectors that you see going forward for
enterprise.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So our enterprise business was deﬁnitely in line with what we had expected. It
has had good solid growth following a lot of the enterprise manufacturing side and
design side for many years.
But some of the macro conditions that we saw at the very ﬁrst half of the year put it
not in a grow-ish situation. Still holding on to some tremendous share, we still have
very strong applications that we work with and are really the go-to GPU for a lot of
the designers and high-end design that takes place.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 16So it was a slight decline, very common in terms of what we saw with the capital
purchasing that was going on around the world and some of the holds that were
done on that.
But we've launched a new set of boards for the overall enterprise market. Those
have come out and we're really focused on design works and really taking the
overall design industry to the new era, the new era where rendering and prototyping
on your screen such that it is nearly real, real with the overall materials that you may
be using such that you may no longer need an actual prototype in real material. You
can't even tell in terms of what you're seeing in terms of on the screen.
So we're very excited in terms of all the new things that we're bringing to the market
to really improve how designers actually leverage the overall GPU.
Our GRID business also in there growing. But, again, it's coming from a much overall
smaller base.
You saw are tremendous presence with VMware at VMworld where we are lockstep
with them and really demonstrating GRID, which is our virtualized GPU that sits in the
data center and enabling a cloud experience that you have access to a GPU.
You see so much moving applications to a cloud environment. And that's extremely
important as we think about the future. But one of the challenges that had not been
solved was that user experience on the inside. You're looking for a user experience
that feels just the GPU is with you in terms of the latency that is taken care of and the
overall screen doesn't have the overall stuttering with a lot of the applications that
are very intensive in terms of visual display.
So we've been working with VMware to continue to grow out that business all the
way around the world where people see this as a very, very need in terms of
collaborating within the workforce. Using workstation or using applications that are
directly installed in terms of on your PC or workstation isn't good for overall
collaborating when it comes to 3D types of designs and some of these things.
The overall virtualization experiences allow everybody access to that cloud and can
see the same thing, whether that be an architect on the job site, whether that be
somebody else who's designing a certain part of the car in another part of the world.
So really expanding the universe in terms of those that will now have those same
visual eﬀects of what a workstation owner would have is what we see. So that is
growing.
Our trials have reached over the thousands and we keep working on closing many of
those deals, not just from a trial. But to a key project to a full installment in many
large companies.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16

Unidentiﬁed SpeakerSo for that enterprise sector as a whole, if enterprise spending, not just for NVIDIA.
But if it stays kind of muted as it is now economically, what sort of growth rate do you
think NVIDIA can drive in that over a multiyear period with some of the refreshes you
have going on in Quadro and with GRID kicking in?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I still think it's there's an opportunity for the GRID to really manage to grow the
overall business as a whole if it was muted. I still believe you will always face periods
of where capital may be constrained.
But it will come time where the refresh is important. These are critical parts of their
jobs that the engineers are doing in terms of design. They will need to keep up.
They'll need that additional performance in terms of the GPU.
It's just a little hard to determine how fast that GRID business will grow to really kind
of catch up with the size that the Quadro business is.
But is it fair to say that you have an enterprise spending assumption macro-wise. And
then on top of that there's is company-speciﬁcs, GRID and the --
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Agreed.
-- refresh that should help almost --
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I agree --
-- regardless of where the base level is?

(inaudible)FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 16Colette KressSo again, if you have any questions in the audience, please raise your hand and just
wait for the microphone.
Why don't we transition from the enterprise side over to some of the growthier, even
faster growing areas like HPC and cloud? I think it's kind of 5% to 10% of sales
depending upon the quarter that you're choosing.
Talk a little bit about what drove than up 50% last year. And I think it's a pretty lumpy
business inherently because this year looks a little more ﬂattish. Over two years that's
still better performance than the vast majority of the semiconductor companies I
follow.
But just talk about the dynamics that are driving that over the two-year period.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
That sounds good. So high performance computing and cloud, this is our Tesla
business. It refers to many years in terms of providing parallel computing,
acceleration in terms within the data center with some of those key workloads, where
really the performance of the GPU is not now being used obviously for visual
computing. But really general purpose compute, taking a lot of the work oﬀ of the
overall CPU.
The performance and the parallel computing capability of the GPU is key in terms of
improving the time necessary to complete several of these jobs.
As you saw back in the fall of last year, we won two of the key architectures for the
future with the Department of Energy with the largest supercomputers in the world.
And why that is so important is a very locked-in understanding of how the
architecture between the CPU and the GPU is going to be very key in these
supercomputers.
So we've seen the underlying high performance computing continue to grow as
more and more workloads and more expansion using parallel computing is there.
But we've also seen a couple new segments enter. And that would be on the side of
deep learning with Internet service providers. Most of information traveling through
the network, whether that be video, whether that be images, whether that be voice,
the key thing that the Internet service providers are looking for is applications that
better serve those overall consumers.
What we're looking for is the ability to image detection, voice translation, voice
recognition, for them to instantaneously recognize all of those pieces, essentially
training the application of these images for recognition.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 11 of 16Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Colette KressSo we've seen Internet service providers continue to expand using GPUs. Why?
GPUs, their performance, bar none, is one of the fastest to get this work done in the
artiﬁcial intelligence phase.
But also for the ability for them to continue to recode, continue to reassess the
overall algorithm to have nearly perfect identiﬁcation. That has driven such a great
growth rate and a part of that 50% growth rate that we had seen last year.
It can be lumpy in terms of the business because we're talking about large projects
with the Internet service providers and their buying behavior in terms of what they've
done.
But we continue to see this entity expansion. And why is it expanding? Top
researchers, higher education, the amount of research papers that is occurring in
terms of the use of GPUs and how they are leveraging them to drive the acceleration
in the data center continues every single day in those pieces.
We now teach CUDA at more than 800 diﬀerent places around the world. And using
that acceleration in the data center as a key thing as you move forward. How is that
data center going to really expand its computing capability if acceleration isn't
there?
So we see the horizon of a large and unique opportunity for the data center just as
we had seen for the PC environment 10 to 15 years ago.
And you mentioned the word acceleration or accelerator a bunch of times. Talk a
little bit about the inherent advantage, from your perspective, of a GPU-based
accelerator versus an FPGA and how the competitive landscape changes, if at all,
with Intel intending to buy Altera.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So with anything when it's starting up there's many diﬀerent ways to skin the cat in
terms of doing those acceleration.
FPGAs have been around for quite some time, 20-plus years as a form factor to do.
It's a little -- it's a diﬀerent of a approach. Some have tried and do work with FPGAs.
The GPU in terms of its overall performance capability, bar none, is one of the
strongest ways to really release the ability in the data center to get the job done. But
an FPGA could be an option for some at a much lower work level.
The challenge that you have it its programmability. The GPU, you're generally
programming at the software level, things that are very familiar, used to. With an
FPGA, a little bit more challenging in terms of that programming ability.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 12 of 16Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Colette KressAs we look forward, again, it's a wide and vast arena in terms of the data center and
the needs for acceleration. But we're very pleased with our ability to serve so many
very important workloads right now for the data center.
Great. Again, if you have any questions, just raise your hand. We'll get a mic over to
you.
Why don't we transition over to automotive? Probably again, about the same size as
HPC cloud, at least as of today as a percentage of sales in the kind of mid-single
digits and maybe even moving to the upper.
Talk a little bit about what's driven the success there. I know you have some marquee
design wins with the likes of Tesla Motors, not Tesla your chip.
But just talk about what NVIDIA's bringing to that market that's allowed the success
today until today. And then looking forward how NVIDIA ﬁts into things like ADAS
and against competing architectures, potentially competing architectures like
Mobile-I, et cetera.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
That's right. So our automotive business, we are not new to the automotive industry.
We've been working probably for eight to ten years inside the automotive OEMs.
We've established a very strong presence in many of the top cars that you see on the
road in terms of their infotainment systems. That can be the center console. That can
also be the dashboard where they're looking for a user interface and really centering
all the digital displays that you see for the drivers.
You'll see us in Audis, BMWs, Volkswagen Golfs, Hondas, Teslas. And the few
Lamborghinis. And all of the other super, super high ends. We've got eight million
cars on the road today.
But what is also unique is we have a pipeline of more than 25 million cars that will hit
the road based on designs that we have already won for those future infotainment
systems and those car manufacturers.
Our focus has been with those OEMs and working through the entire ecosystem of
the automotive manufacturing place. They have their tier ones. We've established a
great understanding of the quality that's necessary, the testing that is. And they keep
coming back for additional overall designs.
So we can see the growth in our automotive as we have seen the overall designs that
we win. And that is going to take us several years out in terms of the future. So that's
where we are today.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 13 of 16Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Colette KressThat's also established us to create the relationships for what we know is coming
upon us in terms of the future. And that is both assisted driving that is here today
and autonomous driving or self-driving cars in terms of the future.
Very exciting in terms of hot market of people getting very excited of thinking about
that major transformation from where we were just 10 years ago.
Technology is becoming a key part of the car. But our focus really wants to think
about that center computing platform inside of the car. It is very, very similar to the
problems that we solve in terms of in the data center.
The data center is very complex, structured/unstructured data sets. A car, talking
about all of the information that is around it that is collected via images, collected
versus radar, sensors, all of the diﬀerent pieces that needs to be processed in a
parallel position.
Then there has to be a set of coding that says what do you want to do with that
instruction? It's not necessarily just identifying what's around the car, it is coming up
with the set of algorithms in terms of how you want to the car to function as we go
forward.
There will be continued milestones along the way to get to autonomous driving. But
our focus has been what type of computing platform do you need that will be with
us for multiple years that is a plug-and-play type of form and help autonomous
driving as we go forward.
We're excited in terms of this platform we call DRIVE that we have now worked with
more than 50 diﬀerent tier one manufacturers, OEM manufacturers and researchers
in the industry demonstrating the capabilities of that platform. And soon we'll be
talking about the designs that we have in that area too.
So who do you see as the primary competition in the automotive market?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
The automotive market, even today, if you look inside of a car, more than 50 or more
diﬀerent processors. So there's been competition in the car, all looking for diﬀerent
things.
I think our approach in terms of the automotive industry is very diﬀerent than any of
these diﬀerent competitors. There may be a processor focused on antilock brakes,
not necessary what we're focused on.
We're focused on where we can leverage what we do best, both on that visual
computing side. But also that center really deep processing power and being able toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 14 of 16Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Colette Kressput that together for the future.
So there's not necessarily anybody competing in the exact same manner that we are.
I think they're all looking at it as a diﬀerent approach. And that is a diﬀerent
approach in terms of a type of chip they are using or how and where they're actually
solving the overall computer problem. But there are many incumbents that have
been in the car for many years.
So why don't we take the chance to move over to some more ﬁnancial questions in
the last couple minutes we have here.
One of them that I get asked repeatedly is on the licensing side, not only the existing
one with Intel and the potential duration of that. But also the importance of
defending IP with some of the lawsuits that you have against both Samsung and
Qualcomm.
Talk a little bit about the role of defending your IP in NVIDIA's mind and strategically
and how you expect both the Intel side and the other two to be reﬂected in the
business model going forward.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. We actually look at them together. I think it's an important piece to keep in
mind. We are currently with a licensing structure with Intel. It is our second
agreement with Intel over the period that we've been around. And that does expire,
its capture period ends in our First Quarter of FY18.
At the same time, we had discussed a couple years ago in terms of the importance in
terms of defending the overall business strategy related to our overall IP. We have a
very strong and very deep patent portfolio with more than 7,000 patents overall and
probably more than 700 of them focused on graphics alone. So we do believe we
have probably a very big lion share of a lot of those important patents.
But the overall monetization of it across the mobile arena hasn't necessarily been
seen. We had been in discussions for several years with Samsung regarding our IP
and that piece. And to our note, we said it probably was going to take the legal
courts to actually solve that.
So about a year ago we went to the, ITC against Samsung and Qualcomm for
infringement. We've gone through the initial hearing. We are waiting right now for
the judge that will come out in the ﬁrst part of October to give them his feedback on
the case. It will likely move from there to the overall commission. But they will also
give a determination of the court.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16

Colette KressWe will then see past there in terms of what the next steps are. But that's a likely path
that will be.
So when we think about Intel, when we think about the ITC, I think they're all
together. I think there are a lot of people looking at this case, the importance of this
case. And looking at our IP, determining what will be the next steps in terms of
graphics architecture licensing.
So we should have a lot more color one way or the other by early January?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We'll get an initial piece in the beginning of October. I think it's going to be more
towards the later part of January, beginning of February in terms of when we may
see the next step.
And is that -- the ﬁnding that -- whichever direction it turns out in whomever's favor,
is that something that there's an appeals process, a next step beyond that or --?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
There is, yes. I think with most cases with the law there is diﬀerent parts of appeal on
both sides. So it is a very important case. We'll watch this carefully in terms of what
those next steps will be along the way.
Great. Well Colette, thank you very much for walking through a detailed lineup of
your businesses. And we appreciate you coming to Las Vegas for our conference.
