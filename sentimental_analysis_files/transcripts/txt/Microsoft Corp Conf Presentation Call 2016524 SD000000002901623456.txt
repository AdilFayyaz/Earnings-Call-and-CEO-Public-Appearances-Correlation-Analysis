Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for joining us. I'm Mark Murphy,
software analyst with JPMorgan.
It is a great pleasure to be joined here by Dave O'Hara, who is CFO of Applications
and Services, Cloud and Enterprise for Microsoft. So many of the parts to the
business that are critically topical to all of us these days. Dave, thank you for joining
us.
Absolutely.
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
I'm actually going to begin by mentioning the safe harbor statement before we
begin. Microsoft may make some forward-looking statements during this
presentation. And you should refer to their SEC ﬁlings for the risk factors relating to
their business. And that's true whether you are here in person or listening on the
Web.
How'd I do?
Great.

Dave O'HaraSo Dave, do you want to start with any type of opening comments? Or any type of
quick introduction, opening comments you want to make, or do you want to just dive
straight into Q&A?
Well just a couple of comments for setup. One is, as you mentioned, I'm CFO for
ASCE. The ASCE, for those that maybe aren't as familiar, is what we think of as Oﬃce
and online. This (technical diﬃculty) C&E is what used to be the old server and tools
businesses. So it's Azure and SQL.
If you look across ASC and C&E, they essentially represent the bulk of our
commercial business from a Microsoft perspective and then some consumer stuﬀ
thrown in. So must of the stuﬀ that we deal with on the day to day basis has to do
with the commercial business.
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
Okay. You've been with the company for about 15 years -- and I'm not including the
Great Plains part of the existence -- so it's a long time you've been there. I think
externally it feels a lot more exciting and dynamic than it did to us several years ago.
The company is executing one of the most successful cloud transformations that
we've seen. I think there is a feeling that the innovation engine is really cranking;
you've got great stuﬀ coming out of the research lab.
And there is also this newfound type of openness coming out of the company
towards other operating systems, other competitors in the ecosystem. What is it that
has you must excited at this point? And what do you think it means for the future of
Microsoft?
Sure. Well so I think there's a lot of things to be excited about. You mentioned the
Great Plains acquisition; I did come in through Great Plains.
I think one of the very ﬁrst people in that, certainly within the ﬁrst week, was Satya.
Satya was on -- was running what was then known as bCentral. And Satya became
part of the Dynamics business. So we worked together back then and then also in
the Bing days.
Then he was running what's now C&E. So I feel like Satya is bringing both a
considerable breadth of understanding of the business, because he's worked in so
many diﬀerent parts of it. And I think he can -- it's easier for him maybe to see all the
connected pieces. And he just brings a new openness, as you mentioned, with some
of the partnerships that we have.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-05-24

Page 3 of 16Mark MurphyBut if you look at where the company has come in the last couple years, I think it's
fairly instrumental in showing where we're going, which is some of the Oﬃce on the
iPad, for example, SQL on Linux. Both of those are just examples of where we're
really more focused on embracing what the customer wants. And when they want it.
And in what environment they want that to run.
So it's not about you're either Microsoft or you're not Microsoft. I think it's just a new
way of working in the world that we have, which is you can be on Microsoft on some
of your products. And open-source on others; and we can make it all work together.
So I think it's just really -- we're forming deep partnerships. We're working with
customers to run a more open environment. We're oﬀering products that we haven't
oﬀered in the past.
The shift from on-prem to cloud, all of those things are things that we jumped on
early. I think Steve started a lot of that; Satya has continued that and, I think,
continued it in an accelerated way.
Then the last thing I would just say is, as we move into the cloud world there is a lot
of beneﬁts to being in the cloud. There is also a lot of -- not everybody can be in the
cloud. It's an expensive business to be in. And it takes a lot to get to scale.
I feel like we're on the front end of that. We started early and I think we're probably --
that's one of the reasons we're a leader in the cloud is we started early, we invested
early. And we have a good -- I think we're in a good spot.
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
In terms of being in a good spot, we actually published a CIO survey last month,
over 200 CIOs responsible for $126 billion in annual IT spending. One of the
questions was: Moving forward, which of the IT megavendors will be the most critical
and indispensable to your IT infrastructure?
Microsoft is (technical diﬃculty) claiming 47% of that vote. And that was actually up
from what we had seen in prior years. That was up by (technical diﬃculty).
So what was interesting was looking at the list below that. Amazon AWS came in
second on that list; and so they edged out Cisco, which kind of held ground.
When you look at the composition of the list below that, everyone else from Oracle
to SAP to EMC and IBM lost ground from the prior survey.
So I want to ask you: How would you interpret that? When you consider that
(technical diﬃculty) change happening below the level of Microsoft? What is it
showing us?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-05-24
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 16Dave O'Hara
Mark Murphy
Dave O'HaraWell I think it is certainly showing a trend in the cloud. AWS showing up on the list is
a business that didn't even exist 10 years ago, barely existed ﬁve years ago. So the
cloud I think is a big piece of that. Some of the folks on that list have done better
than others in the cloud. And I think that shows up in your survey.
Strictly from a Microsoft perspective, it's great to see certainly. I think we have a good
trusted relationship with enterprise. And so they talk to us about a lot of their needs.
We have a few things that maybe don't -- that maybe aren't available from
everybody else. One is we do have a hybrid environment.
We see a lot of our customers who are both on-prem, in cloud; and it's not an
either/or. They really feel the need to continue getting value out of the investments
they've already made in on-prem. But also augmenting that with the cloud. So I think
we oﬀer that, which is unique and diﬀerentiated.
We have a bigger geo footprint than most I think, certainly in any country we have a
good presence in. You see that in how we're building out the cloud, which is we want
to serve countries and -- or we want to serve all geos and make sure that customers
are getting cloud wherever they need it whenever they need it.
So I think that's probably part of the reason that we show up high on the list is we're
an existing vendor with them. They probably have a lot of our tech already. They
want to augment it with even more of our tech. And they have a trusted relationship
with us.
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
One of the other questions in the survey, we asked all these CIOs how much of their
infrastructure-as-a-service work would be conducted on the various IaaS platforms in
future years. So this was a forward-looking question.
We were asking across Amazon AWS, Azure. And also the Google cloud platform.
And what we saw was interesting. It came in 25% for AWS; 24% for Azure.
So what I would say is, if that is going to be correct, that would represent a pretty
material recalibration of the market share as it stands today, right? What is it that
would enable that type of recalibration?
Well I would step back for a second and just say from a cloud perspective we really
see the cloud as being -- the cloud overall, the cloud business overall -- we really see
that as being even bigger than the existing IT business today. So I think just movingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-05-24
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 16Mark Murphy
Dave O'Harato the cloud, there is an inherent growth rate in how you think about cloud versus
previous IT setups.
So I think it's going to be a bigger pie. Hopefully we'll get our share of the pie. We're
working hard to get our share of the pie.
I do think that a lot of customers just want -- they don't want to take a dependency
on one vendor. And there so many diﬀerent workloads that they can parse out some
of those workloads. Some of it they can run on AWS and some on Azure.
From our -- from a Microsoft perspective, we really look at the cloud oﬀering as
being the whole cloud oﬀering. It's 365; it's CRM; it's ERP; it's our EMS solution; it's
CE core Azure infrastructure. So I think that it's not just the infrastructure piece. It
certainly will be competitive from an infrastructure piece. But it's about the value-
added services on top of that.
And I think all of that shows up in the survey. I do think that customers genuinely are
looking to do business with more than one vendor. And they like the oﬀerings from
more than one vendor. And so they'll ﬁgure out a way to make all that work together.
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
What do you think, Dave, the impact of price cuts will be in the future? I think we
look back on this, we can now see (technical diﬃculty) data for AWS. And it will be
on this incredible growth trajectory. Then there will be a quarter where they execute
some price cuts. And the top line will ﬂatten out sequentially for about a quarter
there, maybe even a minor decline; and then it will get back on this trajectory.
I am wondering from your perspective, how do you deal with and how do you
handle price cuts? They may be executed by you, they may be executed by others.
And as part of that question, do you think you are inherently a part of this stack that
over time just gets priced down in a spot market? Is there a commodity part of this
stack that you compare and contrast to (technical diﬃculty) IP?
Yes, I don't know if I'd use the word commodity. I would certainly -- from an
infrastructure perspective, that's table stakes for being in the game. So we feel like
that's a core part of the oﬀering; but really we feel like the ultimate value is in the
services that are oﬀered on top of the infrastructure.
But you need the infrastructure to make all that work. So we do believe that
infrastructure will continue to be a critical part of it. But we think it's about the bigger
cloud picture and less about how we think about infrastructure.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-05-24
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 16Mark Murphy
Dave O'HaraFrom a pricing perspective, the last couple years or the last 18 months have been
more sane maybe than the ﬁrst couple years that preceded that. There's a lot of
question about how big it will be. And who is going to get what share.
We're always going to be competitive on price. I don't think you will ever see us lead
price down. But we're certainly going to be competitive on price.
At the same time that price has been, costs have been going down as well as people
get scale. I think implied, when people ask the question about price, implied in that
is whatever price changes you make down just causes you to lose money. We
believe at the same time that as pricing gets adjusted down our costs are getting
adjusted down, we're getting the beneﬁts of scale. And so we still think there's good
margins in the infrastructure business.
But really it's about the whole cloud business.
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
Let me give you a quick question on a diﬀerent type of survey that we did also last
month. We published a survey of 43 of Microsoft's top resell partners -- resellers,
distributors, consulting ﬁrms, etc. We asked them to rate all your products in terms of
their momentum.
I think, not surprisingly, Azure and Oﬃce 365 came in ﬁrst and second. I think we'd
all expect that.
I think the question we commonly get is: How do you sustain the growth? These
businesses are reaching some type of (technical diﬃculty). How do see the
sustainability of the growth trends for Oﬃce 365 and Azure moving forward? And do
you have any thought on just overall what inning we're in for each of those
segments?
Sure. Well let me talk about 365 ﬁrst. I think we've shared some numbers at
(technical diﬃculty) analyst brieﬁng which -- time ﬂies, I'd say it's probably a year ago
-- where we talked about Oﬃce and its transition to the cloud. We said that by FY18 I
think we said that two-thirds of our exchange workﬂows would be in the cloud. And
by FY18 I think half of our Oﬃce workﬂows would be in the cloud. So that's even a
couple years out, a year out, whatever, however you want to measure it from a ﬁscal-
year perspective. So we feel like there is a lot of runway in Oﬃce.
The other thing I would mention is with our E5 oﬀering which we just launched there
is an opportunity to provide additional SKUs in Oﬃce that provide additional
functionality with that. It's got Power BI and security and voice in the cloud. And
those are all new oﬀerings for us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-05-24
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 16Mark Murphy
Dave O'HaraI think sometimes people look at it and say Oﬃce has really high penetration. And
it's at the upper end of its market. But we really believe, one, there is a lot of cloud
runway left; and, two, there is an opportunity through Oﬃce and through (technical
diﬃculty) to bring in new services that we haven't oﬀered yet.
And it's a great way to do it. Candidly, it's a great way to do it cost-eﬀectively, which
we're already in those sales environments, we're already talking to those customers.
So we think there's new oﬀerings we can bring. So we don't look at Oﬃce and say
what it is today is what it will be ﬁve years from now. We really think there is a chance
to build out that business in a very healthy way.
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
Then let's go directly into that. The assessment across your partners in terms of the
technology, the vision, the momentum of the company is lopsidedly positive. That
comes through very clearly in our survey work.
What is it that you think that they are looking (technical diﬃculty) they're looking for?
Clearly then many would be referring to Azure and Oﬃce 365. But are there
technologies that are on the leading edge? Are there emerging technologies?
Maybe there are products in the research labs that perhaps some of your partners
are more mindful of or have a better awareness than the rest of us externally at this
point?
Well let me get give a little longer answer than that. But I'll try to keep it short. One is
that I think from a cloud perspective there just aren't going to be that many cloud
vendors that compete (technical diﬃculty). And if you are a partner, what you want is
you want new opportunities, because for partners they need to go in and generate
new revenue. So new markets and new opportunities mean new revenue for
partners. I think they legitimately see Microsoft as one of the cloud vendors that's
going to be around a while.
I'll again go back to my second point with E5. Those are all new services that we
haven't previously oﬀered. And those are all new services that maybe haven't had a
partner strategy in the past. There might have been companies providing some of
those services that didn't embrace partners or had a more direct approach; and I
think partners see it as an opportunity for them to break into new categories.
I also think the third thing is that there's new stuﬀ for them to bring to customers,
rather than maybe they've been (technical diﬃculty) the same solutions for the last
few years and maybe it's getting a little stale. There is something new for them to talk
about.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-05-24
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 16Mark Murphy
Dave O'Hara
Mark Murphy
Dave O'HaraSo I think it's the combination of all those things. They see us as viable, they see us as
trusted, they see us as coming out with new services, a new opportunity for them to
go build some trust and make some money with some customers. And that
(technical diﬃculty).
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
For the beneﬁt of the audience, the elements of the E5 SKU that you're referring to
as being new, are you speaking of Power BI, or you're speaking to (technical
diﬃculty)?
Well so we've had a voice oﬀering, we've had a Power BI oﬀering, we've even had
security oﬀerings. But if you look at what (technical diﬃculty) in E5, there's a lot of
newness in each of those.
Power BI as an example, I think that what we had before was maybe not the easiest
solution to implement and didn't have a broad appeal. What we do with Power BI
now I think is certainly easier set up, easier to run, has a better appeal for consumers.
Before it was literally power users on the business intelligence that saw the value in
Power BI. And I think with our pricing strategy and our go-to-market strategy this
implies and even if you look at the ease-of-use, the visualization, people look at
Power BI now and they say: Hi. that has applicability to a broader set of the customer
base. The more users can take advantage of it, which again from a partner
perspective, is just all goodness.
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
With all this goodness coming down the pipeline and all the innovation that we're
seeing from Microsoft, what is it that you think might be missing from your cloud
portfolio? I think we do ﬁeld a lot of questions on the build-versus-buy decision.
When you look back on it, it feels like the approach has been much more build
recently.
I think it's been much more build. But even if you look at -- again going back to E5
with our security oﬀering, there is a couple of components in there from companies
that we acquired. A lot of times what we would do for an acquisition would be
considered in Microsoft terms a tuck-in. But it's super-strategic. I think that security is
an example (technical diﬃculty)
It is hard for any one company to catch up. So we always have a good, solid, organic
growth strategy and we'll continue to do that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-05-24
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 16Mark Murphy
Dave O'Hara
Mark Murphy
Dave O'HaraBut I do think there are select acquisitions we can do that will augment the oﬀerings
that we have. Then our job is to put those together in a way that makes sense for our
customers and have a good go-to-market strategy. But we'll continue to pursue M&A
opportunities (technical diﬃculty).
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
(technical diﬃculty) Let's talk for a moment about your transactional versus the
annuity business. I think broadly we see so many signs that Microsoft is a net
consolidator of spend across the industry in a whole lot of new areas, gaining scale --
gaining share, excuse me, in markets with large-scale.
In the most recent quarter, I think it was clear the core fundamentals remain very
solidly attached. Everything having to do with annuity, everything having to do with
cloud. But you had mentioned a larger than expected decline in the transactional
business, which I think as part of that included some of the on-premise server
business.
So I actually -- if it's okay with you, I want to ask you a few questions on this. The ﬁrst
one, which (technical diﬃculty)?
Well transactional is across both the Oﬃce products and the server products. So it
was both.
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
Oﬃce and server? Then which geographies -- I think we were curious; almost every
company is mentioning Russia, Brazil, China, emerging markets generally. Is that
where you saw the issues? Did it extend beyond that?
Yes. That was part of it. Just a couple of data points which we publish: one is that
from a commercial business perspective, 86% of our revenue is annuity. And that
percentage is growing. So we've been on a push to get people to do more annuities
versus non-annuity; and the annuity piece is the transactional piece.
So some of this is a natural transition. Those get accounted for a little diﬀerently. So I
think there's been a move somewhat away from non-annuity to annuity, which we
see as goodness.
There was also some weakness for the reasons that you mentioned, Mark. It's Brazil,
Russia, etc. Those markets are less annuity.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-05-24
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 16Mark Murphy
Dave O'Hara
Mark Murphy
Dave O'Hara
Mark MurphySo when we're talking about 86%, that's across the commercial business, all up. But
in certain geos, they're more transaction heavy. And those would be a couple of
geos that are transaction heavy.
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
If you step back, you think through what happened with transactional. And we're all
trying to weigh, it could be -- that could be largely macro or it could be an eﬀect of
this transition from on-prem to cloud.
What are you using as a guide to try to understand what was driving the dynamic?
Sure. I think it's two things. Certainly those two.
I think there is a geo ﬂavor to it. There is also a non-annuity versus annuity. Then I
think there's just a lot of customers that are trying to ﬁgure out what they're going to
do.
Are we going to go to the cloud? When are we going to go to the cloud? What's that
look like? What (technical diﬃculty)?
So maybe they are just stepping back and saying: Let's take a long-term view on this.
And we're working with them on that. I think all of those things contributed to
probably a little softer transaction business than we had expected.
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
Any gut feel on whether that transaction softness intensiﬁes from here, or abates, or
maybe what will determine that going forward?
Well I think those will all be contributing factors. Our goal really is to make sure that
they're a Microsoft customer. And whether they choose to transact with us through
annuity or through non-annuity, we're lessening up on that; it's more about making
sure they're getting services and the products that they want from Microsoft. So
we're working closely with them on that.
I would say that our guidance reﬂects what we see as trends in the transactional
business. But we'll see how it plays out. But we feel good about the business. We
feel good about where we're at.
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-05-24
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 16Dave O'Hara
Mark Murphy
Dave O'HaraOkay. Now I want to come back to -- because you had made a comment around
Oﬃce 365. Going back to our partner survey, again looking at it through that lens,
we asked all these partners to look across their customer base and tell us for their
typical corporate client what percentage of their employees are a subscriber of
Oﬃce 365 today? That came in at 39%.
We then said: Where do you think it goes in ﬁve years? That came in at 67%.
So I'd say on the one hand it speaks to -- it's a very large increase and it speaks to
this (technical diﬃculty) roadmap (technical diﬃculty). On the other hand, if you try
the back into an implied CAGR on that number, it's not as high as where it is today.
How do you interpret that? Because I think there could be some measures we're not
capturing -- all the pricing uplift, new logos. So on and so forth -- coming just back
into the opportunity and how penetrated we are into Oﬃce 365?
Yes, I would go back to a couple of stats I mentioned earlier, which is we feel like
from -- our view of the business (technical diﬃculty) going to be (technical diﬃculty)
cloud in FY18. And Oﬃce will be 50% cloud in FY18. We still see good runway
(technical diﬃculty).
Even if you just look at the business as it is today, we think we still have good, healthy
room to grow and we're conﬁdent that we're in a good position. I do think that when
we ask customers -- like when you ask customers questions like that -- they're
looking at Oﬃce as it's constituted today. And they don't necessarily see all the new
service oﬀerings that we can augment (technical diﬃculty).
So I think Oﬃce will continue to increase its footprint. I think the way that shows up in
our ﬁnancials is price, ARPU goes up because I think people are maybe contracting
with us for services that they were getting from someone else previously. So it results
in a net savings to them. But it results in a net revenue increase for us.
So I just -- I think it's -- we feel like there is good runway both in the existing business
and where it's at today and the new service oﬀerings that we'll be bringing onboard
in the future.

Any quick comment on the decision point to make your ﬂagship database, SQL
Server, available for the ﬁrst time on the Linux platform? That's been a tremendously
successful product. It's in the upper right-hand corner of the Gartner quadrant --
Yes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-05-24

Mark Murphy{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
-- for the ﬁrst time. So it is being assessed as the world's number one database.
Congratulations on that, by the way.
Thank you.
What was the decision point that drove the company to keep that on the Windows
platform and all of a sudden to decide to make it available on Linux, which I think
happens in a year? Because I think we've also seen -- Amazon seems to be another
company calling out the database industry as an area of potential for disruption and
opportunity.
Yes. Well we certainly see a lot of opportunity within the database business and data
in general to -- there can be a lot of really healthy growth for companies that are
positioned correctly. With SQL on Linux it was really about we want to be able to
give -- we want to be able to allow a developer to write any app they want on any
platform. That's what it comes down to.
And it does come down to helping customers, giving customers choice. Because I
think when people look at SQL on Linux and they say, wow, is that a big revenue
opportunity? Is that -- how do you think about that? I think long-term there is a lot of
good revenue opportunity there.
In the short term, what we got from a lot of customers was just a sense of relief that
they could continue to run the stuﬀ that they're running now. And they could
continue to look at new options. So it's really about giving customers choice.
So it wasn't -- we weren't focused on -- we were focused on (technical diﬃculty)
saying you can run what you want when you want. And we'll ﬁgure out a way to make
it work. So I think customers saw it as good for the current environment and the
future environment.
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
Let's come back; I want to ask you one or two more quick questions and then we'll
poll the audience and see if anyone would want to ask anything. I want to come back
to E5, because you've already mentioned it a couple times this morning. So you have
this new E5 option for licensing Oﬃce 365. It's your top-of-the-line plan. It's the
primo plan.
I think our understanding was that E4 was not a really heavily adopted SKU. Perhaps
there is a misperception on that. I think E3 was very heavily adopted.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-05-24

Page 13 of 16Dave O'Hara
Mark Murphy
Dave O'HaraSo you're early on; you're very early on in this. What do you expect out of E5? Is
there anything you've observed so far in the early innings in terms of just how
customers themselves are responding to E5?
Yes. E5 we just launched in Q3. To your point, Mark, E3 was certainly our hero SKU,
though, where we had (technical diﬃculty) penetration. And we felt like E5 is a good
augmentation (technical diﬃculty).
If you look at what's available on E3s, Oﬃce Exchange and SharePoint and Skype for
Business in E5. It has the security oﬀering. It has Power BI. And it has more voice
functionality. So what we're getting from customers is a lot of curiosity about what it's
going to oﬀer that isn't in E3. So we think we have a good value prop around that.
I also think if you look at the components of E5 and how people would adopt those:
Power BIs they can adopt right away; security is something they can certainly adopt
right away; voice maybe takes a little longer.
So what we typically see as Enterprise agreements come due people just take a look
at their mix and say: Hi. (technical diﬃculty) new oﬀering out there, how should we
think about that? So it gives us a good opportunity to go in and explain the value
prop.
I certainly think there is a lot of diﬀerentiation between E5 and E3. There is a lot of
goodness in there (technical diﬃculty) IP revenue that they are paying to a diﬀerent
provider. And that they now decide to go with Microsoft for that. Which we see that
as a big opportunity for us.
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
You mentioned voice. And I want to go into that topic, Skype for Business. We've
seen a lot of indications that there is strong potential for that product. I was with an IT
team recently talking about the potential for that to cause their Microsoft spending
to uplift in future years.
Could you walk us through that? Because I think we're all trying to understand
whether (technical diﬃculty) the communications market with Skype for Business?
I would describe it this way. Voice is complicated, as anybody who runs voice
infrastructure knows. It's something that you don't just throw it out there.
I think even with the cloud and on-prem there is -- the question we get is: Do you
think the world is going to ﬂip to cloud? It's not going to ﬂip. It's all about a transition
and it's all about an orderly transition.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-05-24

A - Dave O'HaraVoice is probably that (technical diﬃculty) so nobody is going to -- it's unlikely that
companies are going to go ahead and just throw out the PBX and move to us. But
they might do it (technical diﬃculty) organization at a time. Or they might literally
say: Hi. we're bringing a new building online. So we'll go use your voice solution for
that building.
But people don't want to lose their communication capability. And so they are very
thoughtful about how and when and why they do that. So I do think that that will -- I
do think that over time (technical diﬃculty) opportunity for us. I just think it's -- in that
way voice is similar a little bit to an ERP or CRM app, which you don't just throw it out
and start over on day one. You've got to build toward it. And we see that as a good
long-term build opportunity for us.

Okay. We have just a few moments left. Why don't we check for questions from the
audience? If you would, raise your hand if you have a question. And we have a
microphone right here in the center aisle. We have one right here.
Questions And Answers
Thanks. Can you talk about recent growth in the SQL Server business and
competitive dynamics in that business?
Sure. I missed the ﬁrst word. What type of growth is your descriptor?
Just recent historical growth.
Recent? Recent growth, okay; thank you. I do feel -- if you deﬁne SQL as strictly
license database I think that we look at that as being upper-single-digit growth. We
felt -- we feel good about, to Mark's earlier (technical diﬃculty) about where we're
positioned in the market. We feel good about SQL. We feel good about how we're
positioned relative to competitors.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-05-24

A - Dave O'HaraSo I think there is an opportunity for us to go take some share from existing
competitors. I think the market overall will grow. The analysts have all been in the
mid-single digits, maybe a little stronger than that; we would certainly expect to get
our share.
So we will see growth with the market in terms of license database. I also think with
SQL Azure that will grow along with the size of that market as well.
When we look at SQL, we really look at SQL across cloud and on-prem. But from an
on-prem perspective, we certainly expect that we'll pick up some share along the
way from an on-prem perspective.
Can you provide your thoughts on key success factors for sustained competitive
advantage in services?
Sustained competitive advantage in services? I think you need to have the
infrastructure to support the services, which is why we're having the big cloud build
out. You need to have services that are easy to set up, easy to digest. And easy to
use.
To state the other obvious point, you need to have services that people want. Then I
think from a Microsoft perspective in terms of how you think about competitive
diﬀerentiation, from an enterprise perspective we're in all of those accounts; we have
trusted relationships that are expensive to build. It takes a long time. Hard to
replicate.
So you've got to have all that. I think you got to have the right services, you have the
right go-to-market strategy and have the relationship with customers. And you have
to have the infrastructure.
On the transaction slowdown, how much of that is self-inﬂicted versus other?
It's hard to parse. We get as much precision as we can; but we go in and say: Okay,
how much of this is due to shift from non-annuity to annuity? And we have an
estimate of how much that is.
We say: How much is due to things like geo-speciﬁc issues? We have an estimate of
how much that is.
I would say that if you say transactional slowdown, I would also put it in context,
which is our transactional slowdown was around $100 million in a $12 billionFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-05-24

A - Dave O'Harabusiness. So we don't see it as -- it's not Armageddon by any stretch.
But -- so we would say some of that is shift, some of that is geo weakness, some of it
is probably just a little bit of an unknown. And we tried to build all of that into how
we view the future.

Okay, with that, we are out of time. Dave, thank you very kindly for spending it with
us. Great having you here.
Sure. Thanks, Mark. Thanks.
