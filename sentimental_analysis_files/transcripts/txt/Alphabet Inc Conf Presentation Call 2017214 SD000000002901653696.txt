{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
All right. Good afternoon everybody and thank you, again for joining us today on
behalf of the TMT team here at Goldman Sachs. Our next guest really does not need
any introduction, she is a pioneer in technology, one of my favorites, Diane Greene.
She's been the leader of Google's cloud businesses including Google Cloud,
Google Technical Infrastructure and Google Apps. She also serves on the Boards of
Alphabet, Intuit, Khan Academy and MIT. She co-founded and was CEO of VMware
for 10 years from 1998 to 2008 and I think it's probably gone down as one of the
most successful infrastructure companies that we've seen and clearly one of the best
things that could've ever happened to EMC. So I'm going to bring Diane on stage in
a second. She's going to give a quick ﬁve-minute or seven-minute slide presentation
to level set everybody. But before I do that, I am going to make some disclaimers for
them. So some of the statements that Diane will make today may be considered
forward-looking. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to diﬀer materially. Any forward-looking statements that
Diane makes are based on assumptions as of today and Alphabet undertakes no
obligation to update them. Please refer to the Company's Form 10-K for a discussion
of the risk factors that may aﬀect its results and with that Diane, please join me on
stage. Thank you.

Hi everybody. It's really great to be here and as we all know, there's just this
unprecedented re-organization of the IT world and actually how our world operates
with data and mobile and the cloud and it is so interesting and challenging to be in
the middle of facilitating the cloud, fulﬁlling all its potential. And then I'll just say it's
just an incredible privilege to have Google's resources, Google's people. And
Google's unbelievable infrastructure and software services to apply to the IT world
to enterprises everywhere.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

Page 2 of 14I want to just take you quickly through what we are, what we have, as Heather said,
just to level set us. Google's got -- ﬁrst, the lowest level, our infrastructure, hundreds
of thousands of miles of ﬁber network all over the world. We constantly will have
large companies come and want to lease network from us and it is -- we have to have
low latency for our seven apps that are over a billion active users. Our data centers
perhaps operate more eﬃciently than any other data center. We're rolling new
regions out with regularity, PoPs all over the world, signiﬁcant CapEx investment on
an ongoing basis by Google.
Security, Google's had security pretty much from day one because of the necessity
to keep people's data private. I think we arguably have the most secure cloud on the
planet. But we've also really hunkered down over the last 16 months to get all the
compliance and regulatory so our large customers can prove to their customers and
to their regulators that they are indeed secure. I mean security matters from the
board on down to the individual user, IT worker at a company, it's so important and if
you look at things like G Suite, our productivity suite built in the cloud completely in
the secure cloud and you map that to the diskless Chromebook, you actually can run
a workforce with an amazing level of security.
Google, when I say it's a privilege to be at Google, Google organizing the world's
information, we've been inventing how to manage data for 16 years now, how to
really quickly go through massive amounts of data. BigQuery is used at Lloyds to
understand trends, FIS is using it to do trade transactions, equity transaction trends,
$25 billion an hour. And Spotify makes real-time decisions with that thing. And today,
we just announced I'm really happy to say our new -- the ﬁrst in the world distributed
transaction -- worldwide distributed transaction platform, Spanner. There's a really
incredible article in Wired about it and basically, we're the ﬁrst to be able to keep
those transactions in order spread across data centers and so the kind of availability
that gives you and scalability and you have a company like JDA has been using it
and everybody is just seeing an amazing increase in the amount of data they're
getting at all these devices and everything and so I think Spanner is coming at a time
and it's going to have really high value to the enterprise.
Then machine learning, of course, Google has been doing that since before 2000.
Larry Page invested very early. We arguably have the largest assemblage of machine
learning experts with DeepMind and Google Brain and now Cloud Machine
Learning, Fei-Fei Li recently joined us from Stanford. We're really democratizing
machine learning, making it so every company anywhere can use it and it is -- I mean
a company that isn't using machine learning is going to be, if not already, at a
disadvantage.
Of course, modern application development environment, place to build your
applications, to deploy your applications, to maintain your applications, everything
from the virtual machine to the container, to the Functions, the App Engine
orchestrated by open-source Kubernetes so you can run hybrid, you can run multi-
cloud and then to talk to the mobile devices, to talk to your customers, to talk to your
partners and even your own employees through Application ProgrammingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

Diane GreeneInterfaces, the API management company we bought last year, Apigee and then
ﬁnally a full blown mobile developer environment and Firebase and much more.
All of Google runs on what's called Google Apps. We re-branded it as G Suite, the
complete collaboration suite in the cloud from day one now totally infused with
machine learning, getting smarter all the time, adapted to teams and just more and
more coming out all the time. We've really accelerated our investments there as well.
And I think the biggest -- we've ramped up our engineering investment across the
board. But really the heavy lifting in the past 16 months has been around how we go
meet our customers in the market. So we reorganized. So we have one face to the
customer, customers appreciate that. We have -- because we're Chromebook for the
enterprise, we're G Suite for the enterprise, we're Cloud, we coordinate with the ad
side of the house and so forth.
We organized an Oﬃce of the CTO. So for the diﬀerent verticals, we have really
senior architects that can go in and work with our customers, ﬁgure out their proofs-
of-concept, professional services to go out and work with customers. We are now
getting customers saying we just want to move everything to the cloud, that takes a
lot of services to help and then a lot of training and certiﬁcation for customers and
partners. Google invented something called Site Reliability Engineering. For each of
our apps, we have engineers focused on it being the right architecture and never
going down, constant availability. We took Site Reliability Engineering, added a new
group called Customer Reliability Engineering so that our customers' important
services will also get the same attention, which they need and it's really a huge plus
for them.
Then partnering, partnering is so critical to us. We're very partnering friendly, I really
love to partner. So we have a strategic partnering group, partnering with customers,
partnering with strategic partners. And then the go-to-market partnering around
channels and SIs. And there is more. But we've got all this stood up, its operational.
We're growing as fast as we can and we're really excited and having a good time.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Great, have a seat, after that intro, I guess one of the things I would ask, I mean it's
been a little over a year, I think you said 16 months since you came on full-time to run
this business for them. What would you say the two to three biggest initiatives were
when you got there and how would you say you feel like you've executed on those
as you look back?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
As I was just talking about, I mean it was immediately clear that there was a lot of
work to do in how we went to market and we've brought in a lot of very experienced
enterprise people to help with that and done a lot of training and really integrated
the whole group so we're all executing as one and everybody's enjoying it. We got
long-term customer roadmaps in place so our customers know when they're going
to get what and what's in the horizon. That's been really welcomed. Those are two
examples.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

What are your conversations like with customers today? How have you furthered the
conversations with them?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Yes. When I arrived, I would be in a customer meeting and I'd think it was going
really well, we'd be talking about our technologies and everything and I'd say, well
any more questions? And they'd go -- Yes. Are you really serious about the
enterprise? And I'm like, okay.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
I think there is a bunch of people in this room that ask the same -- I get asked the
same question, I'm sure others do as well as, is this something that Google is really
serious about?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Yes. Well, I mean I feel like Google was built to do this and Google feels this way, the
Board feels this way and the customers now, as you will see it at Next, also feel this
way. But I mean it's an amazing diﬀerence. So it went from are you serious about the
enterprise to this summer people were saying -- Yes. But you're never going to ﬁgure
out how to go to market. And I'm like, it's not rocket science. But we'll get it, we
know it and we're doing it. Then now, people are just, it's astounding how many
people are coming and saying, we just want to be in the cloud, can you just move
everything to the cloud and I actually didn't expect that so soon.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So when you're talking to customers today, what are the things that are most on their
wish list? Is it functionality, is it sales, is it --
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Oh, from us?
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Yes. What do they want from you? What are customers asking you for most often
when you are meeting with them?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
I mean customers are really, this buzzword 'digital transformation' is real. People
realize they need to move faster, they need to use their data. And they need to reallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

Diane Greeneleverage their data and they look to us for all that and they want help. They want a lot
of help. That's why we're building out our partner network pretty successfully, the
likes of Accenture and PWC and Deloitte and so forth. But a lot of people want to do
machine learning and want to do data analytics and they want to understand really
how to stage their movement to the cloud. There are people who want to
understand what it means to be in the cloud, how to think about estimating their
costs when they come from their own data centers, the whole thing.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So there are people in the audience that might say, again it goes back to, is Google
serious about the cloud. But they would say enterprise isn't in Google's DNA. What
do you say to that comment?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Well one interesting thing that I've discovered is our ad sales force is a pretty strong
enterprise sales force bringing in $90 billion a year. That kind of takes a serious
enterprise sales force. So I ﬁnd that kind of interesting. But having an integrated
business unit that is focused on working with customers and servicing customers and
bringing all these software services to customers is somewhat new, although we
have had our own internal customers forever, these seven apps that have over 1
billion active users. I will say that now that we're putting so much in place for our
enterprise customers, our internal customers are coming to us and saying -- Can we
have that too? But it's really interesting, our engineers, engineers love to have
impact and the scale that we're seeing, the growth we're seeing is just so exciting for
everybody that everybody is pretty on board because it's fun to have this kind of
growth.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So if you look at your two biggest competitors in the cloud, you've got Azure and
you've got AWS. There is a bunch of questions I have on this topic. But what in
particular would you say diﬀerentiates what you're doing at Google?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
We have the cloud for the enterprise because the enterprise has to lean into data
and that's what Google was built for. So I feel very good about where we are and
what we're doing for people -- something like BigQuery was recently identiﬁed as
the top way to analyze large amounts of data because of its speed and automation
and so forth. But I think we're highly reliable, we're highly secure, we're highly
scalable and we have very good technical people to partner with companies which is
super valuable because that's a scarce resource and Google's really good at that. So
when I look at what we have in our diﬀerentiation, machine learning, I feel like we're
kind of in the sweet spot of where customers are going and we're seeing that
conﬁrmed over and over as we start meeting with more and more -- working with
more and more customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

And so if you think of the go-to-market strategy for AWS is we were there ﬁrst, right.
And we might be leading the feature war. For Microsoft with Azure, it's you're already
running a lot of Windows technologies in the enterprise. So there's kind of a -- they
have an easy place to go in and sell into. What would you say, when you're talking to
the sales force or to your partner community, what's the easiest way or what's the
path of least resistance for them to get in and sign up customers for your cloud?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
The easiest thing has been around data management, data analytics. I mean that's
just a no-brainer and before we started getting these lift and shift requests, that was
the easiest way for us to start working with a customer. Now, we're seeing that
people just are ready to -- people want to take advantage of what Google
understands how to do and Google wants to share that and it's a lot of innovation,
it's a lot of leverage for a company so that the company can take advantage of the
latest technologies and not have to worry about having the people to do that in-
house which is increasingly hard to do because technology is moving so quickly.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
You mentioned the lift and shift requests, were you seeing those six or 12 months
ago?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
No, we weren't. It's really been. And I would say about four months ago, they started.
And you know, I met with ﬁve customers this week and three of them asked for that. I
was like okay, things are diﬀerent.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Yes. What do you think it is that's caused that change in the types of questions you're
getting asked?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Well I think the whole world is waking up to the fact -- Hi. I'm going to be more
secure in the cloud, I need to digitally transform myself because that's going to give
my business a huge advantage. Then wow, Google's there, Google's got what it
takes to do that, they would be a good partner because they're clearly going to keep
me on the cutting edge of technology. So once I get digitally transformed, I'm going
to be able to keep moving forward with the strengths that are important to giving my
business an advantage.

interactive, I'm going to go to the audience. So if the roaming mic’s can stand up and
we'll see if anyone has any questions for Diane as well before I jump back into these.
But just based on those lift and shift comments and the new requests that you're
getting, where would you say we are -- with that perspective where would you say
we are in terms of cloud adoption and if you want to use it, whether it's baseball or
whatever sport that you might happen to like, like where are we in this..
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Somebody said to me it's like they're just maybe getting ready to play the national
anthem, like we haven't even started. But the cloud is on everybody's mind. I mean
my next door neighbor at Stanford, he sees me, he's a neuroscientist, he's like, hey
Diane, how's the cloud? Kind of cloudy up there. Everybody is thinking about the
cloud. But in terms of moving and every company in the world, everybody -- a lot of
companies are dabbling in it. But we are just at the very early stages of people really
moving.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And I think that's somewhat surprising to people at times given that this is something
that again, I mean AWS started this a little over 10 years ago to think that we're still
just scratching the surface.
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Yes. It kind of started with the start-ups, then it was kind of the surplus capacity thing
and then it was like, well, let me see if it's a little more. But now it's mainstream for
the enterprise and that has just -- that awareness I think is very new.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
I think Dino [ph] has a question right up here and right in the middle, make it really
easy for the mic to get to you. Just hold on one second. Do we have a microphone?
Anybody have a microphone? Dino you can project well. So let's try it.
(microphone inaccessible).
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Okay, I'll just repeat the question, which is, as I look forward at Google, are we going
to just concentrate on infrastructure or are we going to move into the applications
and how does AI tie into that? Is that --FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
And other diﬀerentiations, well, we're already in the application space because we
have Google Apps, G Suite. And that's actually a platform for people to develop with
too. We have a lot of partners, we've already announced Slack and Box and
Salesforce and Evernote and so forth and anybody can use those APIs. And we have
all the APIs for our machine learning. But I sort of see infrastructure as a service, then
data management and analytics, which I don't think is so much infrastructure
because then you're getting into -- once you get into data management and
analytics you're starting -- and then machine learning, you're getting very vertical
because you're solving speciﬁc problems in speciﬁc industries. And we're deﬁnitely
we recently had an insurance company and that we solved a problem around how
they process crashes -- automobile crashes, saving them a large amount of money
but a very speciﬁc problem. And so you'll see more and more of that. And there's
just all these verticals, there's retail, there's health, there's ﬁnancial services, there's
media, the government, federal.
And so, IT is moving to the cloud. So there's everything. So we are adding -- we're
working with our customers. We want to make it eventually so our customers can just
drop a Function, just drop an application, depending on what they're trying to do,
into some kind of container and we can just automatically make it secure, available,
scalable. That's where it's going and it's going to so empower companies to invent
new things in their area of expertise. And that's really what we're positioning
ourselves to do for people and we're increasingly doing it.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Any, another question in the audience? Sorry, there's one up here.
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
And those little Functions will automatically be making real-time decisions on the
machine learning on their data, right. It is going to be good.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
There's a mic right here.
Hey Diane. So to beat AWS, you need to catch AWS, I'm assuming you're not in this
to be Avis to Hertz. But if that's the case more speciﬁcally and maybe pulling it into
the next couple of years, what are the vectors that allow you to accelerate faster than
them, is it containers, is it the verticals, is it the integration with Google Docs, some
more clarity as to how exactly you'd do better than AWS rather than what still seems
to be across the board a chasing game.

Q - Heather Bellini
A - Diane GreeneI think what Google is bringing people is a really great way to do all the things they
need to do to move quickly and have really powerful insights into their business and
be in a position to digitally act on them. We're moving to almost a completely digital
world and you'll basically have a virtual company sitting in the cloud that you are
analyzing and doing things. And I think it's not about having a lot of diﬀerent
oﬀerings for all these little things, I think it's about being able to do that for
companies and I think we're doing a really good job through our machine learning,
through our data analytics, through our developer environment, through our
embracement of open-source and just the way we're helping our customers very
technically. And so it's really -- I do think we're fairly early and there's a new thing
going on for the enterprise now that they're looking at being completely in the
cloud. They're not just doing it to save money, right? They're doing it to have their
company be the most competitive company and that's what we're about.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
You've mentioned and there's been a lot in the press about the partnership strategy
and you've been investing a lot in your partnerships over the last six months or so.
When does that start to have an impact on your business?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Well we already see a bit of an impact as we start to partner and it's really -- that's a
really good question. We've invested a tremendous amount in training. In fact, we
bought a company Qwiklabs that does the online training -- did all the online
training for AWS -- and that's really giving us some leverage as we train all our
partners and share how to help people take advantage of Google Cloud. I think we'll
see more. Every six months, it's going to be a lot more. I've never seen the kind of
growth that's going on here.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
If we go back to your VMware days, the company's success -- the partner strategy
made a huge impact there. Do you see it following a faster impact to the business
based on your last comment?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
I think it's possible.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
That was a big impact, that's good. Your RFPs, I wanted to touch on. Sundar has
talked a lot about this a little bit on your conference calls. Before you mentioned,
you're getting into more RFPs, can you share with us kind of how -- not looking for
speciﬁc numbers but kind of how you're seeing your win rates change and just the
number of RFPs that you're kind of competing for now, how those have changed
over the last year?

We don't need the exact numbers.
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
I think my biggest challenge is organizing for scale and hiring for scale and
partnering for scale because we really are setting a very high bar for the quality of
how we operate with our customers and that we've been steadily raising that bar
over the last 16 months. And so we deﬁnitely don't ever turn away business. But it's
really all hands on deck because there is a lot going on.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And the sales force, I know we talked about the ad sales force. But in particular for
the cloud sales force, what changes have you made since you've been there and
kind of how do you think about the capacity increases you need to go after the
opportunity that's in front of you?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Yes. Well, so that's a combination of our sales force and partners. But in terms of our
own sales force, we've reorganized it, we've radically increased the number of sales
engineers, the number of architects, the number of people helping people with
regulatory and compliance issues all over the world. We have teams now and they're
very organized around which accounts are theirs and which regions are theirs and
we've just really put a lot of discipline into it.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Do you have a vertical focus for the sales-people now as well?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
We have some overlays for areas where we want to have a little more expertise. For
obvious reasons, we have a lot of retail companies running on Google Cloud and
Google's got a lot of expertise where we can help them there. Then but it's across
the board, I mean health, because of all the machine learning we've got, it's been a
big one. FinTech is something we're super excited about, all that's going on there.
And media, we had bought this company, Anvato, streaming video company, that is
really getting a lot of traction and building more about that and bringing in some of
our technologies because of course with YouTube and the machine learning, we've
got a lot of great abilities there, there’s a lot of opportunity.

A - Diane GreeneI think a question that some of us have is, or a problem that we have, is that you're
growing this business, you're investing in it very aggressively, within the context of a
really beautiful dominant, high margin, core ad-tech business. And I guess what the
question is is can you give us some comfort that as you get more and more
successful and bigger and bigger within Google that it doesn't dilute the economics
of the core business?
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
That might not be her area of expertise.
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
So I'm not going to talk about our core business. But I will say that cloud really has
economies of scale.
Much larger scale I presume.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
It's an interesting question by the way because no one ever -- like Microsoft has a
very high margin on-premise business. But that question doesn't really get asked of
them because the cloud is lower margin. So you guys get judged by two diﬀerent --
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
There's a lot of diﬀerent parts of a cloud.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
We'll go here. I'm sorry, right there.
Hi Diane, given your technical background, can you help us understand the key
technology or architectural diﬀerences between the three major cloud platforms
AWS, Amazon. And Google and where you do think you have an edge?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
I'll talk about where I think we have an edge. Obviously, we have an amazing
network with ﬁber laid under all the oceans and we're pretty fortunate there. We
have been building data centers for 16 years and those things are -- you walk in there
like a hospital, they just sparkle and they're so secure. There's no people anywhere
and we've applied machine learning to the eﬃciencies there and done real research
there with the machine learning. So that's goodness, it's not something that's
immediately apparent to a customer what the network is. And our Machine Learning,
as we bring more and more to every customer and we bring some of the things
we've done in hardware to our customers around that, I think it's going to be an
enormous advantage -- it's already an advantage, it's going to be an increasingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

Q - Heather Belliniadvantage. One thing we've done is Google has always hired very elite systems
people and a pretty remarkable organization and I always felt like VMware had a
pretty remarkable systems organization. A lot of my VMware friends are now at
Google. And we build things from a systems standpoint. So when we do something
like high availability, we look at it across the entire system because any component is
the weakest link.
So we do it systemically. When we do something like identity and access
management and roles, we do it across the system. So it's across it very consistently.
And I think that's got huge advantages for customers. It does slow you down a little
bit. But once you get it and know how to do it and do things in that way, one, it helps
you as you move forward and keep evolving but two, for a customer, they don't have
to worry about inconsistencies across their diﬀerent services. That's a fairly technical
answer but I do think that's a technical advantage we might have.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
I wanted to do a follow-up. You talked a little bit about machine learning, how do you
ensure that you maintain your competitive advantage here and how long do you
think it is before we see people taking advantage of machine learning and actually
rolling out, using it for their business, I mean we hear a lot about it's the technology
of the future. But is it actually --
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
No. We already have customers. Like one public customer we have, Airbus, has used
it for processing satellite images and it's saved them a lot of money.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And how do you keep your competitive advantage?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
How do we keep the competitive advantage. Well one, we are able to attract
amazing machine learners. We have a very big research program going on. So it's
going to keep us out ahead. There is a certain amount of machine learning that's just
going to be available to everybody. We did TensorFlow, we open-sourced it,
everybody can use it. We're partnering with IBM on TensorFlow. That's something we
want to partner with everybody on, yet we have an advantage if it runs on Google
Cloud because of some of the hardware things we're doing, which I think will give us
a fairly sustainable advantage. At the end of the day, everybody is going to use
machine learning. I mean it's, when we have to train more people to have expertise
in machine learning because it is quite a hot market. I was recently at a Women in
Data Science Conference in Stanford and the women were asking for advice and I
said, well, one thing I can tell you guys is don't be afraid to take risks because you're
the most employable people in the world.

Q - Heather BelliniYou mentioned you've been building data centers for 16, 17 years right, when we
think about the utilization of your cloud's data centers, how do we think about it?
Because I mean I think people look at the CapEx investments that whether it's
Amazon is making for AWS or whether it's Microsoft with Azure, is there no -- do we
not have to see the same step function increase just given how many you have built
and the sheer reach that you have across the globe? And can you talk a little bit
about how you think about leveraging the capacity utilization of these?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
That's one of the things where you get the economies of scale because the more
loads you have to distribute across your data centers, you can almost over provision
because you can kind of globally see what's going on and in any kind of resource,
be it network, CPU, storage. And so we do a lot of study of all the workloads and
we're putting a lot of eﬀort into just-in-time provisioning of these things. But having
enough capacity that we're never going to get caught short. But a lot of computer
science, a lot of math going into understanding how to provision for the right
capacity and keep them as maximally utilized as possible at all times, these things
are really expensive.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So for Google, it would be more, you don't necessarily have to build out capacity
way in advance just given the types of --
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Well we kind of see our growth. We can anticipate what's going on. But we're also
getting really quick at rolling more capacity out.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Okay there was one question here before and then I want to wrap it up with another
one.
Could you talk a little more in detail about why FinTech has you so excited?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Oh, why does FinTech have me so excited? Well, it's a huge segment of the IT
market. And we are like, there is a lot of data in FinTech, there's a lot of things just
ripe for machine learning. And security is paramount there, it just seems so suited to
our strengths and that's what we are seeing. And also we're working with all the
banks on projects and we can see how much there is to do. FinTech is, I mean, since
my days at Sybase I've been working with FinTech, it's a big industry and there's a lot
to do there.

A - Diane GreeneGreat, last question for me, if we were lucky enough a year from now to have you
sitting on stage again, what would you expect to have achieved, right, if you would
have reﬂect back on 2017, what would make you happy in terms of the goals that you
could have achieved for the cloud business?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
I think I want to really have a number of large great customers talking about us,
partners. You'll see a fair amount of that at Next on March 8th through 10th, our
annual user conference here in San Francisco. I hope that people will understand
why we're really the cloud for the next-generation of enterprise and that won't be a
question in people's minds. They'll really see it. And our role in this cloud industry
will -- we'll be getting diﬀerent questions.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Great, all right. With that, thank you everybody. Diane, thank you very much.
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Thank you.
