Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our afternoon discussion with Alphabet. We
are thrilled to have Philipp Schindler with us this afternoon.
We have a series of disclosures and everything else to read. So ﬁrst, I would remind,
all important disclosures, including personal holdings disclosures and Morgan
Stanley disclosures, appear on the Morgan Stanley public website at
www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures or at the registration desk.
Now the safe harbor. Some of the statements made today by Mr. Schindler may be
considered forward-looking. These statements involve a number of risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to diﬀer materially. Any forward-looking
statements that Mr. Schindler makes are based on assumptions as of today. And
Alphabet undertakes no obligation to update them. Please refer to Alphabet's Form
10-K for a discussion of the risk factors that may aﬀect actual results.
Philipp joined Alphabet in 2005. You're Alphabet's SVP and Chief Business Oﬃcer.
You oversee all of global and regional sales and business activities for Google
Search, YouTube. You drive revenue across all services across all the countries. I think
you landed probably about a couple of hours ago and was stuck in traﬃc. So thanks
a lot for coming.
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Yes. We have a very nice weather here in San Francisco, as usual. So (not easy) if you
ﬂy in. We made it. We made it.

Google Map got you here. So the ﬁrst one I wanted to start with just because I think
it's always interesting to sort of hear what happens kind of behind the scenes at the
Alphabet machine. So maybe talk to us about the scope of your role, what you do
kind of on a day in, day out basis and sort of your 1 or 2 top priorities for 2019.
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Look. So ﬁrst of all, my #1 focus obviously has to be our revenue growth. And the way
we achieve this is actually quite interesting because we cannot grow our business
successfully unless we really made our partners, our customers, our advertisers
successful as well. And just to dive really deep into this right away, take a look at
most of our contractual structures. Most of our business structures are based on
some form of CPC, ROI, CPV type of relationship. So unless we make our partners or
our customers successful, unless we can help advertisers successfully transition to
the digital world, unless we can grow our creator ecosystem, unless we can grow our
app developers, we really cannot grow ourselves. And this is a very big part of the
area I focus on, number one. The second one is all of our services business, I run our
technical operations, consumer operations across the world. And we're a very, very
large business. By now, we have over 90 products in 25 diﬀerent languages. I think
we have a service, call or chat per second at least across the world, not even
counting all the online web interactions. So how do you get ready for a world of this
scale? How do you deploy machine learning? How do you get your services
operations ready for that type of user interaction? And obviously, the growth
environment that we're in, that's the second big one. The third one, third area of
focus is our country operations. I run our country operations across the world. So
how do we eﬃciently, eﬀectively run all of those countries? How do you put a lot of
focus on high growth markets like India and Brazil that we have, for example? This is
a very, very big pillar of our work. And the fourth one is really around, I'd say,
leadership and operational rigor. We're undergoing all of those business at the
moment with a pretty robust growth rate. And if you take a look at the level of
leadership you need to be able to operate in such an environment, it takes a lot of
energy. It takes a lot of eﬀort. That's one. But also the operational rigor, I'm not sure
that's something that is so known to the outside world. But we really try to run our
world a little bit like mission control, like space shuttle control center, or I don't know,
maybe it's SpaceX now or Blue Origin or whatever it's called. But we take a very
data-driven approach to how we actually run our business. So we have incredibly
detailed dashboards. We deeply understand not only the revenue distribution and
composition across the world but all of the leading indicators that are necessary for
us to predict where things are going. And we do a lot of what we call spread
management. So because we run the business across so many diﬀerent countries,
we can exactly tell here's a certain part of the business that's doing well in some
country. We can cut it down to country level. We can actually cut it down to team
level. And we can see whether some of it is really successful and what the spread is
between the best and the worst across the world. And so we can really try to learn
from the best and we can just increase the worst. And we do this very, very
consistently and in a really, really data-driven approach to help me run this. And
maybe just to give you a simple example, we know, for example, that our customers
will beneﬁt if they move their bidding systems to the next generation of machine
learning to what we call auto-bidding or smart bidding. So we have a very deepFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 3 of 15Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - Philipp Schindler
Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - Philipp Schindlerunderstanding what the percentage in our customer base, in our portfolio is when it
comes to smart bidding or auto-bidding penetration. So we know exactly who's the
best in the world. We know exactly who's the worst in the world. And we know
exactly how much value can be generated for advertisers or how much value that
over time has been generated for us by moving the worst to the best and by actually
obviously also increasing the best a little bit more. So we do a lot of this spread
management in a very, very rigorous way. The operational rigor is one of the biggest
areas that I focus on.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Understood. That's a lot, irreplaceable. Yes, $100 billion of revenue, plus or minus on
an annualized basis. I guess when you mention all diﬀerent products, I thought the
automated bidding was a good example of kind of where we want to go. I'd be
curious to hear about sort of the process that you take internally when you think
about trying to push new advertising units or new monetization opportunities on the
platform? And this is sort of a debate that we have a lot of time on Wall Street about
the addressable market for ad dollars. How do you think about sort of the amount of
dollars that are available to be captured by Alphabet?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
So a couple of diﬀerent things there. First, the addressable market side, there's a lot
of misunderstanding about it because people usually refer to the total above line
advertising market, which is more or less the traditional television and a bunch of
adjacent areas. It's usually being described as $500 billion, $0.5 trillion market in
size. Let's not forget there's a huge diﬀerent chunk, which is below the line market
and there are diﬀerent estimates of how high this is. There are a lot of people saying
it's at least equal the size, if not higher. Actually -- I actually agree with this. Then you
have to look at other.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
You agree it is bigger?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Well it's equal to the size, would be above the line, if not bigger, potentially. Then
there are adjacent markets that are slightly overlapping. But if you look at the fact
that still 90% of commerce is oﬄine, there's a big opportunity obviously in this
environment. And in general, I don't think about it in the sense of traditional
advertising. I think we are actually in the business of connecting businesses to
consumers. And as long as the business generates a positive ROI and search
advertising is obviously -- one of our main markets, is providing incredibly positive
ROI for our advertisers and it's actually working. And I hope all of the other business
that we invest in and represent are actually adequately investing and understanding
the ROI that they generate for them. But the reality is it's working really well. So as
long as the ROI is positive, I don't think we are really limited in the way we should
look at our markets. And our market sizes. When we look at maybe the second -- ﬁrst
part deﬁning of your question, when you look at our core business, I usually try to
decompose our business, especially the Search business, into the diﬀerentFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 15Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - Philipp Schindlercomponents. So when you look, for example, at core search, #1 part of that
decomposition would obviously be all queries. Maybe we'll park that piece for a
second. The next big piece within that is obviously our ad coverage. If we go a little
deeper of how we run it actually internally. Our ad coverage is obviously not at
100%. So we're trying to provide the best answers. We're trying to provide the most
meaningful answers to consumers. But the reality is there's probably an interesting
development path if you think about that metric. The next one is our -- what we call
our customer -- our click-through rate as the next big part of that decomposition. On
the click-through rate side, again, very, very similar question you should ask yourself,
what's the upside? What's the improvement area? Are we telling about ﬁxed rates
somewhere towards 100%? Obviously not. What can we do to creative to make them
better? How can we deploy machine learning to make CTRs better? Very, very
interesting areas of development you see in this world. Then the last big driver of
our core Search business is obviously the whole world of our CPC, our customer
click, what are people willing to bid. And in this environment, one of the biggest
drivers of the CPC is the world of conversion rate. So again, very, very similar
development here. If you take a look at the world of conversion rates, what's the
upside, I mean, you are investing in a lot of comparable business, probably you have
a deep understanding of conversion rates. I don't think anybody would say we're
coming in close to a world of 100% conversion rate. It's probably not even a fraction
of that. But if you think about the upside of what can be done by accelerating mobile
website, loading speed, by making payments easier, making transactions easier,
making discoverability easier by using better UI, there's probably signiﬁcant upside,
which will then right away, basically, positively inﬂuence our CPC development. So I
can look at it from a total addressable market perspective, connecting businesses to
consumer. I can look at it from a detailed decomposition of our Search business. I
think there's a lot of interesting potential there.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
On the point of Search, I have a few I wanted to ask you. So let's start with mobile
search, where over the last few years, you mentioned the ad coverage. We've seen
the number of ad units increase. Then in the case of mobile search, last couple of
years, there's been a series of other innovations as well that at least we think have
helped drive better mobile search monetization. As you sit in your seat, what are 2 or
3 of the products that you're most excited about to continue to drive the strong
mobile search monetization as you go into '19 and '20?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Yes. So ﬁrst, you have to keep in mind, we are launching roughly around 100
enhancements to our core search product probably per quarter. So that's a very, very
signiﬁcant number. Then the second part of the question that I'll talk about are really
the things I'm the most excited about. So what is really the upside? Again, we'll talk
about, ﬁrst, potentially a little bit later in terms of the overall development. But how
can I drive ad coverage? What is the upside on CPCs? What's the upside in click-
through rate? How can you help all partners, the ecosystems, the advertisers,
agencies, other partners that we work with to be better in all of those things. And we
have pretty signiﬁcant investment in all of those areas because of what I just
described. I feel there's a lot of room for improvement there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25

Is it from the desktop side? Because the desktop is -- sometimes we focus on all
these tech companies as I'd like to think about. How are you doing in your oldest
business? And we think for the desktop search business, that's a 20-year-old
business. That's about $40 billion annual revenue, still growing. We think high single,
maybe even low double digits in some quarters. That's pretty impressive. How have
you been able to do that from just a monetization perspective? And as we transition
towards mobile and into voice, how do we think about the desktop monetization
potential?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
That's a great question. Always keep in mind, just because a new platform comes
along does not mean that the other platform fundamentally disappears. And there is
no doubt that obviously mobile and the mobile revolution has signiﬁcantly increased
the amount of interactions with mobile devices. But the reality is also that desktop is
still a very robust business. Just to give you a feel, there's a lot of use cases, which
are mostly high involvement use cases where you want to do complex travel
bookings, where you look for a new life insurance, other insurance types and so on,
where the desktop business is actually very, very robust. And my expectation level is
that it will actually -- is here to stay for quite a while. When you take a look at the
future, you're exactly right, the next revolution, evolution, whatever you want to call
it, after the mobile one or in parallel to the mobile one kicking in is obviously
everything that has to do with Voice Search or Assistant in the broader context. And
if you look at our eﬀorts in this area, we have an Assistant products that is roughly on
1 billion devices. At the moment, we have 20% of our queries in the U.S. on Android -
- on the Android mobile app coming already from voice. So it's deﬁnitely a trend that
is not only emerging but is also already happening at a very, very signiﬁcant scale.
It's happening across multiple diﬀerent surfaces. It is the expectation level that the
amount of interaction with digital devices by having a much easier to use voice-
controlled interface, that this level of interaction will increase. You can probably
assume that this will be the case. Will more things that you've done historically in the
oﬄine world transition to those easier user interfaces across all those diﬀerent
surfaces? And with that, I mean whether it's your mobile phone, whether it's your
mobile device, whether it's your speaker, whether it's your car, whether it's your
smart device and diﬀerent other types. Yes, of course, I mean, that's a very
interesting development. The challenging part about this is in general, that the
smaller the surface areas, the surface area, the higher the expectation level from the
consumer for very high-quality results, whether it's organic or an advertising result.
But that's something we're actually historically very good at. So very simple example,
you look at desktop, you have (10 billion links). You have a look at mobile, you have a
lot less. You look at our system, that only gives you one single answer. The consumer
expectation level for the quality of this answer will be signiﬁcantly higher. The
obvious follow-on question would then probably be, well, in a voice in, voice out
world, where you only have one single answer, how do you build your monetization
model? And I think it's really important to understand in that context that Assistant
does not only mean that you have a voice in, voice out model. But for so many use
cases going forward, especially commercial use cases, I think we will actually see
voice in, display out as a much more interesting use case. And you can see already
smart speakers emerging. You can think about a lot of other areas where you actuallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 15Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - Philipp Schindler
Q - Brian Thomas Nowaktalk to some sort of digital assistant. But you get a visual back and very simple
example, right, if you're interested in buying a new nice jacket and you ask the
Assistant, "Hi. show me the nicest, whatever, blue jackets that are available in my site
category," like would you want the speaker to say to you, "Well I have blue jacket A
and B and C," or would you rather have a really nice picture being displayed? Then
we're in a world, I think, that we're very comfortable with where you have visual
results, where you can really do amazing discovery experiences and then where you
have room for advertising, of course, or call them really interesting commercial
experiences as well. So this business is roughly how we think about the evolution
from desktop to mobile to Assistant, diﬀerent surfaces, diﬀerent output factors, by
the way, diﬀerent input factors as well. Voice does not need to be the only input
factor for an Assistant. You can think about a world where you use something like
Google Lens, video, pictures as an input factor to an Assistant. So it's diﬀerent input
and actually diﬀerent output, depending on what users actually feel more
comfortable with.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
That jacket example actually may have -- you might have answered the next
question. But I don't -- perhaps not. So you've been investing in shopping search for
quite some time between the Shopping Actions, Google Express, the Product Listing
Ads. And now you mentioned Voice Search. So is the next steps really to capitalize
on shopping? Do you need a visual interface? Or how do you really deliver more
value to advertisers from a search shopping perspective?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Well I mean, on the mobile device, we have -- on the desktop and on the mobile
device, we have a pretty visual interface, right? That's already working well. And we
have a lot of really nice shopping products. If you look at our Product Listing Ads as
one, we have Shopping Actions, for example, that we've launched, where we've seen
a 7x increase or something in the number of merchants participating, including a
number of very, very big merchants, Nike, Best Buy, Sephora and so on, really nice
development. We have obviously the ability to measure sales lift at a much diﬀerent
scale now. I think we're talking about somewhere in the area of 10 billion-plus
transactions that we've measured already in this environment. We talked about
Google Lens that you can use as an input factor into all of these. So we have a lot of
really, really interesting products in this area. The reality is also now if you look at an
existing PLA product, which is probably the biggest product that we have at the
moment, the Product Listing Ads in this environment. And if you look at a shopping
query and if you look at how you -- left and right, swipe through a little carousel,
would I describe it as the best discovery experience ever developed in the world of
mobile shopping? Probably not. So we're spending a lot of time and energy in
thinking about how can we make this a bigger, better, richer visual experience,
better consumer experience overall. So I'm actually pretty excited that there is, to put
it positively, upside in the UI development and the user experience there.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Let's go back to the Voice Search point, you -- voice, there's a lot to talk about Voice
Search and services. Is it a threat to Alphabet? Is it an opportunity for Alphabet? HowFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 15A - Philipp Schindler
Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - Philipp Schindler
Q - Brian Thomas Nowakdo you think about kind of Voice Search and sort of the steps that it needs to kind of
make it -- the chasms it has to cross to actually be a real monetization opportunity?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Well I think about Voice Search in the context of the Assistant development that I just
talked about, well knowing there's a tiny little diﬀerence, depending on how you
deﬁne it. But if you look at the evolution again from the platforms, from desktop to
mobile to the more assisted interactions with computing interfaces, that's where
something that Voice Search ﬁts for me. So my assumption is if this Assistant
environment with computing interfaces becomes easier to use and more ubiquitous,
we will see a lot more of it. We will see it be a lot richer. We will see a lot of visual
output factors. Again, the use case -- we'll go even to the simplest use case, what's
the weather forecast for the next 10 days. Do you really want the Assistant to read to
you it's going to be rainy on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and go on and
on? Or do you just want to have like some sort of projection or picture or something
on your mobile device triggered or something that is on the television in the nearby
room because you're aware that it's in the nearby room in a privacy-sensitive way,
obviously. So there's so many diﬀerent ways of how you can think about Assistant
services and very rich answers and then we're exactly in the world that we deeply
understand, which is very similar to the monetization models that we actually run
today.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Got it. The other thing in search I want to talk to you about is the idea of the Discover
feed and the activity cards to your point of making search more visual. What have
been sort of the early learnings of those products? And how do you think about sort
of building advertising and really helping advertisers buying demand through those
products?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Yes, I mean, those are great products. I think we have -- on Discover feed, we have
like 800 million monthly actives at the moment. So that's a nice number. And it's a
feed that tries to understand the consumer well obviously and give really relevant
results for you. And whenever you understand the consumer well. And you can
create also interesting commercial experiences around it. So that's deﬁnitely
something we're thinking about and something we're excited about. I would think
about it very comparable to how we run some of our traditional search systems at
the moment.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
YouTube, you do have a video product through YouTube that is on a certain number
of TVs. So you're well positioned from that perspective. We still think based on our
(authorized) data, YouTube is still destination #1 when it comes to online ad-based
video. Strong reach, strong engagement. Maybe talk about some of the recent ads
you've rolled out on TrueView that -- around YouTube, we've heard about TrueView
for Reach, TrueView for Action. How has that changed the advertiser discussionFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 8 of 15A - Philipp Schindler
Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - Philipp Schindleraround YouTube? And talk to us about the real drivers of YouTube's revenue growth
from here.
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Yes. So YouTube has always been a really interesting platform for brand advertisers.
And what we've really tried to develop over the last few years is also the ability for
YouTube to cater to performance advertisers. And we've invested in this pretty
meaningfully over the last few years. And it's actually worked really well. And the
reason for that is if you look at what consumers are actually using on YouTube, I
mean, there's a signiﬁcant amount of how to do something, how to learn something.
Incredible. I mean, let me ask you, I mean, who here in the room -- I can just see who
is paying attention, who here in the room has actually, at one point, used YouTube to
either search for something they want to get better at or to research a certain
product? Yes. So just for everybody on the audio, I think that's probably 90%-plus,
how to become a better ﬁnancial analyst, whatever. I mean, there's a lot, how to
become better at running a Google business guide also probably out there. But the
reality is there's a lot of really, really, relevant information out there, which obviously,
once you get some of the systems infrastructure right, we have some challenges
around conversion tracking and so on. So it wasn't an easy path. But the reality is, I
mean, it is working. It's working extremely well for performance advertisers. I think
we have over 30% of our advertisers are new to -- the ones who are now using our
performance product to YouTube and so on. I'm actually very excited about that part
of the development. Then obviously, let's not forget YouTube is still great for brand
advertisers. I think we have more 18 to 49-year-olds on YouTube than the top 10
primetime shows in the U.S. combined. I mean, those are pretty meaningful
numbers. So brand very well established the performance business. And I mean, this
is not something that just had happened like this. I mean, with Universal App
Campaigns, I think we started in 2015, roughly, tapping into the performance and
then the TrueView for Action, which we launched, I think, in March 2018, if I
remember correctly, about a year ago, is exactly the discussion that we just talked
about. So yes, it's a very exciting environment.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
And new group of advertisers. The map that probably got you here, sometimes I say
it's the most under-monetized asset that I cover, it's the Google Map. It's almost like
a utility we're just kind of waiting for you to put the switch on. And I guess there's
been some early map monetization experimentation over the last couple of years via
the sponsored links, via the promoted pins, et cetera. Talk to us about sort of the
early learnings of the map monetization products. And what are the puts and takes
that you make internally to decide how quickly to push the cadence of monetization
on that?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Yes. So Maps, there's a lot of diﬀerent angles how you can look at Maps. And I think
the easiest way to do it is by diﬀerentiating between the diﬀerent consumer use
cases. And there's obviously the angle where you use Maps to basically get to a
certain destination very, very quickly. And that's the very much utility use case. And
you need to be really cautious that you don't interfere with the consumer experienceFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 15Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - Philipp Schindleron this one because the consumer wants to get really quickly to their destination and
wants that information quickly. But once they have an understanding of the
destination, then there's obviously an interesting monetization model that you can
develop around this. The second big one is when you have people who are asking
something around near me. Is there something near me? Is there something around
it? And if you look at some of our latest products that we've developed like our local
campaigns, by the way, based on a lot of machine learning and then using some of
the advertising products that you just described, I think that's quite an interesting
area if we think about it like this. The third one is really the more broader discovery
element. I want to discover something around me, not directly near me. But in the
broader sense, you could think about personalized recommendation. You can think
about, again, in a privacy-sensitive, opt-in way, basing it on places you've already
visited historically, make your recommendations and then take this into a completely
diﬀerent world. And I think the fourth area to think about is the world of what we call
Google My Business, the SMB world, the discovery for all of the small businesses that
are around you. How do you tie this into it and make it a really seamless, easy
experience? So I think if you think about Maps monetization, from those 4 diﬀerent
angles, a little bit more caution obviously on the ﬁrst one, not disrupting the utility
aspect. Then all the other 3, I think, really, really interesting playground going
forward.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
There's sort of talk about how machine learning almost is overused buzz phrase. I'm
saying it, not you. But I guess just sort of to simplify it for someone like me, can you
just give us some examples of how you use machine learning internally to improve
the overall user experience, the advertiser oﬀering and then even the value you
bring to partners and publishers? Just give us some examples of what goes on
internally to use machine learning.
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
On the user experience, there's so many examples. I mean, everything from how
Google Photos operates to what we do under the hood for spam detection and so
many other things. I mean, there's a gazillion examples of how we use it on the user
experience. So let me focus on the monetization side and the -- at the advertiser and
partner experience. The most interesting areas are probably where we've completely
revolutionized some of our apps products like Universal App Campaigns. This is
fundamentally built around machine learning. You have it with Smart Shopping
Campaigns today. You had something which we've launched a while ago, which we
call responsive search ads, where we're now trying to tackle the creative problem
and try to basically be much better at predicting what are good creatives, rewriting
creatives completely as rethinking the world of creative in the digital environment,
which by the way, goes back to some -- remember when I decomposed at the
beginning our core business and talked about CTRs and so on. You can think about
when those things come together, what those developments could be. So those are
all diﬀerent products. You can also uplevel a little bit and you can just ask yourself,
okay, how can I use machine learning to either be better at ﬁnding audiences in
general so I have the right message for the right audience, the right creative
disposition to react to a certain advertising message obviously on the audience side.
Again, you can think about it from a creative perspective. The other big color inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 15Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - Philipp Schindler
Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - Philipp Schindleradvertising, I just talked about it. Then the big third one is obviously bidding
because the fact that the machine learning algorithm should be signiﬁcantly better
and is signiﬁcantly better at bidding than most humans, most traditional systems is
pretty obvious. So if you think about it from an audience creative or bidding
perspective, those are also really, really interesting areas where we applied and
frankly where we've applied it for quite a while. Our advertising team is very, very
sophisticated in using our latest machine learning developments to basically then
apply them to those diﬀerent areas. And I see a lot of interesting things there to
come.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
With the CTR, the ROI for advertisers, a lot going on. One of the assets that, I think,
almost doesn't enough attention sometimes, this is my view, is the Google Play store.
This is an asset that you power up billions of Android users. You're taking,
depending on the structure, 15% to 30% cut on the transaction. I think that's a pretty
good business. A couple of the big debates that go on, your perspective. First, what
are 1 or 2 of the biggest areas of innovation that's needed in the app store? Then
number two, how do you think about the potential to restructure some of those
commission rates and maybe even lower them to help publishers get more exposure
or kind of get out with a lower take rate?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Look, the way I think about it is that developers or publishers or however you want to
refer to all our partners here, they're getting an actually pretty signiﬁcant amount of
value from our investments here. And we're investing very heavily in this world,
whether it is in the whole world of security and safety, massive developments to
create a really clean and safe ecosystem. That's a very big area. If you look at all of
our diﬀerent developer programs that we're running, play the best console and so
on, massive, massive investments on our side, really value creating for our
developers out there. That's a big area. If you look at the whole world of payment,
payment infrastructure, facilitating payments, making them easy, seamless. Another
big world. If you look at, #4, the whole world of Discovery, recommendation engines,
promotions of app, really appreciated by the developer ecosystem as well. So if you
look at all those 4 big areas, I think there's a lot that they're getting back from this. So
I actually feel we have a pretty good, pretty interesting setup here.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
You mentioned payments. And I would argue over the last few years, Alphabet's
payment strategy has evolved somewhat. And as time goes on, as you sort of think
about the importance of better linking transaction to an advertising dollar spent,
payments is probably only going to get more important. So maybe talk to us about
some of the learnings as you sort of rolled out Android Pay and diﬀerent iterations
over the past couple of years. What are sort of the 1 or 2 areas you really focus on for
payments going forward?

A - Philipp SchindlerYes. So what's really interesting, you mentioning it part of linking transactions to the
advertising piece, which is what a lot of people refer to. I actually ﬁnd the most
interesting piece from the payments perspective sitting in the -- facilitating the
transaction piece, accelerating it, making it easier. And again, this goes back to what
we said at the beginning, if you start decomposing how our business really works, if
you really want to drive up conversion rates, one of the biggest drivers at the
moment, I mean, who of you here in the room has abandoned some sort of
shopping cart process or similar purchase process simply because it was too diﬃcult
to use your payment credentials, right? So if you think about how you could drive,
for example, conversion rate by just approving, simply payment ﬂows in themselves,
I think that's actually very interesting upside in all of this. So that's one. I think the
other way of thinking about payment is it's really worthwhile spending time in
emerging markets when it comes to payments. At the moment, I'm not seeing the
most exciting development in the traditional established markets. I see a lot of really
exciting things happening in emerging markets. And this goes even for ourselves. So
one of our most successful -- one of our really interesting payment product that we
have actually launched was in India, where we've taken a totally diﬀerent look at
payments. We created a conversational UI around payments. We call it Google Pay
now. We used to call it Tez at the time. And it's a very interesting development
because when you look at just the numbers at the moment, I think we're at the 40
million monthly actives on that product. We are processing on a run rate, I think, 60
billion in transaction processing at the moment. So I can see us actually developing
payment in emerging markets and then taking them to more mature markets and
then obviously thinking about value propositions to the user that actually goes
signiﬁcantly beyond traditional payment. There's so much more you can do, whether
it's on the loyalty site, whether it's in a lot of diﬀerent other areas. But I think to really
make payments be successful, you need to create new value propositions in that
environment. We work very closely obviously with banks and ﬁnancial institutions.
And yes, that's how we think about it. So interesting learnings from emerging
markets on this one.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
And UPI has certainly helped a lot in India. I have a couple more questions. But we
are going to open it up for Q&A. So if you do have questions for Philipp, raise your
hand. There will be mic runners running. There's one over there. On the emerging
markets point, completely agree with you from the advertising side, on the payment
side. Alphabet's been a pretty, I would argue, aggressive investor to sort of make
sure that you're well positioned in all of these emerging markets. Are there any other
nonpayment, advertising opportunities that you see in emerging markets that
potentially are just not being appreciated by the Wall Street community?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
It's interesting you asked this. Think about it slightly diﬀerently. Like I actually think
like my #1 focus when it comes to emerging markets is actually making our existing
core products successful or even more successful in the emerging markets because
if you think about the upside from a Search perspective, from a YouTube perspective,
from a Maps perspective, from an Android perspective and so on and so on, it is
actually -- I think, it's pretty signiﬁcant. Then, of course, we have diﬀerentiated
investments in emerging markets. We talked about the payment example in India. ToFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25

A - Philipp Schindlergive you another one, we created a product called Files, Files by Google, which also
we launched in India and is actually now coming back to the U.S. And it's getting -- I
think we're also in the 40 million monthly active range. And this one is coming back
to the U.S. Really interesting, really interesting development as well. So this is just
from a product perspective. But don't underestimate the role of our existing
products in emerging markets, number one. Then to the monetization aspect, the
advertising potential in emerging markets is also very interesting. When you look at
most of those markets, it depends a little on the deﬁnition. But we're seeing
transition growth rates from oﬄine to online or digital growth rates by themselves in
the 30%-plus rate in the overall market, not talking about ours speciﬁcally. But in the
overall market. But don't discount or don't bet against that transition opportunity.
Don't bet against all the SMBs in emerging markets that want to be connected to
their consumers. Again, similar to the ﬁrst point I made, we're in the business of
connecting businesses, big focus on SMBs to consumers over time. So that's -- and
then there's obviously local monetization opportunities that are probably evolving
diﬀerently than in the mature markets. And that's why we have teams on the ground.
That's why we have a lot of investments there because we want to make sure we
don't miss them. And in many -- or in some cases, we might actually take them back
then to the more mature markets. So yes, that's exciting but don't bet against our
mature product and the traditional monetization systems there.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Got it. Last one I have, Jim and Ellen, like this discussion, regulation and privacy.
There's never a shortage of topics. I sometimes joke and tell my boss I need to have
a lawyer on my team just to sort of keep up with everything that's going on. So
maybe just to your perspective, talk us through what you've seen in Europe from
GDPR, pre-GDPR, post-GDPR, how have things changed or not changed and maybe
any potential comments around potentially the copyright law in the EU.
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
Yes. Look, I mean, we have been working with data protection authorities for many,
many, many years. And we have been closely involved in obviously working through
the GDPR challenges. Very, very interesting developments. We are -- of course, we're
extremely pro privacy. We want to create a very privacy safe environment for
consumers. Not a single doubt about it. So we were supportive of GDPR in that
context. I think the most interesting observation in this environment was not so much
the amount of time we had to invest. And we have invested a lot of time and energy
in getting our systems ready for GDPR. But I think the most interesting observation
was the amount of time and eﬀort. And we maybe even underestimated that a little
bit, how long it took us to help all of our partner ecosystem to get ready for GDPR,
whether it's on the advertiser side, the publisher side, ad tech platform side, other
industry consortiums and so on and so on. So I think we touched over 12,000
diﬀerent players through the 1.5 years, two years that it took us to get ready for
GDPR. I think the overall investment was something like 400 person years or
something. So very, very meaningful. But we feel very comfortable with the eﬀort
we've done there. We've always valued privacy. We put it on an extremely, extremely
high level. So that's GDPR development. You asked about the copyright piece as
well. So on the copyright reform side, we've always been very clear that we're
supportive of copyright reform if it's beneﬁcial to a broader ecosystem, which meansFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25

A - Philipp Schindlerit needs to be beneﬁcial to users, it needs to be beneﬁcial to creators, it needs to be
beneﬁcial to platforms, of course. The current development, I would say, that creates
a certain level of uncertainty. It's far from clear how the implementation -- ﬁrst, it still
has to be ratiﬁed fully. Then it's far from clear what the detailed implementation on
the member state side will be. So there's deﬁnitely some uncertainty around it. But I
would say we're pretty good at managing uncertainty. And if you look at how we've
managed through GDPR, where there was a lot of uncertainty at the beginning, I
think we've done pretty well. I would say I trust our ability to do the right thing for
the user and manage through large-scale complex uncertainties.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Questions for Philipp? There.
I want to go back to YouTube for a minute. Can you just tell us very roughly, let's say,
look at the United States as a metaphor, how many people go on YouTube in this
country every day? How much time, on average, those users spend on YouTube
every day? And how would you measure your revenue per user as compared to
traditional mass media with respect to time spent and revenue conversion?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
So if I recall the latest public numbers correctly, I think we have somewhere in the
range of 8 -- 1.8 billion logged in users at the moment around the globe. That's the
global number. I don't think we break out the U.S. number for YouTube. We have --
actually, it's really interesting. We have a very signiﬁcant percentage of the watch
time of those users by now on mobile devices. It's over 50% of the watch time that's
actually sitting on mobile devices. Just to give you a few of the facts that we publicly
shared. Our fastest-growing product, from a watch time perspective, at the moment
on YouTube is our living room product. So watching -- you referred to it brieﬂy,
watching YouTube on a big television screen. And of course, we have a good
understanding of our revenue metrics and what do you call marquee metrics or
there's a lot of diﬀerent ways you can look at it. So yes, we do understand those
metrics quite well.
I think your microphone is oﬀ. I can't hear you.
We'd like to understand them also. I mean, how many people -- how do you measure
-- how do we measure how much potential there is in YouTube? I know a simple
example. My grandson doesn't watch TV. He's 12 years old, okay. He's either on
YouTube or Netﬂix. He spends 2 or 3 hours a day using one or the other for 100
diﬀerent reasons. So it's a lot of people. And that's the future. So what I'm asking you
is help me in understanding what it means to your business. I'm sure you know that
we like to understand that because we've got to make the investments.

thank you so much. The observation that you're sharing is an observation we're
hearing quite often. And it's probably reﬂected in the numbers I just gave you. So I

just explained. So thank you for giving us those insights. I feel that's a trend that is

Question?
Google sits obviously on a lot of data that you mostly use now to monetize through
advertising. So how do you think about using that data also towards other direction.
So for example, in ﬁnance or other ﬁelds where that data could be monetized quite
well as well?
{BIO 21014597 <GO>}
So let's be very clear. Our #1 priority is to keep our users' data safe and secure and
handle it in the most privacy-sensitive way possible. And for this, we've invested
really, really heavily not only in the last few years but for many, many years in the
most -- one of the most sophisticated, I personally think the most sophisticated,
privacy systems out there when you look at it from a transparency and control
perspective, if you look at products like Google Privacy Dashboard, if you look at
products like Google Takeout, which we launched, respectively, in 2009 and 2011
and so on. So that is our #1 priority. Of course, some of the data is used in our
advertising systems. No doubt about it. There's nothing speciﬁc we have to
announce at this time when it comes to using it in diﬀerent environments. I cannot
see us yet doing anything ever as a company that would violate the #1 principle I
talked about, making sure everything we do is being used in a very privacy
respectful way.

Whenever there's a new inventory pool that is being made available for advertisers
that generates positive ROI for them, they usually take a look at this. And it's
something they're interested in. That's healthy competitive dynamics. What we can
see, especially in the cases that you mentioned, especially on the Amazon side, is a
lot of the budgets that are being addressed at the moment are more trade promo
type of budgets, budgets that historically have actually not shifted at the same rate
and speed into the online world, even budgets that we didn't access so much
historically. So that's actually something where you could say it's -- the discussion we
had at the beginning around the total addressable market and how you think about
it that this actually might accelerate the shift of oﬄine towards online, which would
be beneﬁcial for the broader ecosystem, including ourselves. So that's how you
should look at it. The interesting part of it is that a very, very signiﬁcant percentage of
all consumer journeys are still starting from a shopping discovery perspective on
Google. So that's something we feel very comfortable about. Then we brieﬂy talked
about the fact that there's a lot more we can do in terms of UI and creating really
amazing commercial experiences for users in such a shopping environment. So
overall, I think we're in a pretty good position on this.
