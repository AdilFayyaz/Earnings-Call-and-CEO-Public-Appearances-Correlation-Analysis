Good morning, everyone. On behalf of our Board of Directors and our management
team, senior management team, thank you to all for joining us at this PepsiCo's 2019
Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Thank you, to all our friends in New Bern for

PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 2 of 10Let me begin by -- the meeting by introducing our Board members who are here
with us today. I'll ask each one of them to stand as I read their names: Shona Brown,
Cesar Conde, Ian Cook, Dina Dublon, Richard Fisher, Michelle Gass. Michelle is our
newest Board member. And I'd like to oﬃcially welcome Michelle to PepsiCo.
Michelle is the CEO of Kohl's Corporation. It's a leading omni-channel retailor. And
we're very fortunate to have Michelle, her insights and her experience on our Board.
So welcome, Michelle. Continue; Bill Johnson, David Page, Bob Pohlad, Dan Vasella,
Darren Walker and Alberto Weisser.
With me on the stage is David Yawman, our Executive Vice President of Government
Aﬀairs, the General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. And let me also introduce the
other members of our leadership team that are here with us today: Hugh Johnston,
Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Oﬃcer; Laxman Narasimhan, Global Chief
Commercial Oﬃcer; Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo North America Beverages; Steven
Williams, CEO of PepsiCo North America Foods; Ronald Schellekens, Executive Vice
President & Chief Human Resources Oﬃcer; Jon Banner, Executive Vice President of
Global Communications and President of the PepsiCo Foundation.
Let me say also what a privilege it is to be joined, once again, by Paul Finney, the
CEO of PepsiCo Bottling Ventures, our largest bottling partner in North America; and
by Jeﬀ Minges and his sons, Miles and Landon. Jeﬀ runs Minges Bottling Group, our
bottling partner here in New Bern and across Eastern North Carolina.
So thank you guys what you do for our partnership and growing our business
consistently. And thank you to everyone who is here today either in person or in -- on
webcast. I want you to know I consider it not only a responsibility but a privilege to
come here and tell you how we're making good on your investments.
I'm proud to tell you that as we head into in the summer of 2019, we're a very well
positioned company. In the First Quarter of this year, alone, we grew organic
revenue of more than 5%, increased core constant currency EPS by 3% and we grew
our core constant currency operating proﬁt by 10%. This top line performance, which
was very good, was broad-based with particularly strong organic revenue growth in
our snack business in North America, which grew 6%. And our international divisions
also grew very fast. ESSA delivered organic revenue growth of 8% and both Latin
America and AMENA grew at 10%, very, very strong results.
This was one of our best quarters in years. And it shows that the plans we're
executing, the investments we're making in the business, which I will tell you more
about it shortly, are working very well. We're accelerating growth and investing in
capabilities to drive sustained performance long into the future. These strong Q1
results build on the positive business momentum that we started to gain in 2018. Last
year, we met or exceeded each one of the ﬁnancial targets that we outlined at the
beginning of the year. We grew organic revenue by 3.7%, we grew core constant
currency EPS at 8%. We generated $7.6 billion of free cash ﬂow excluding certain
items. And we returned approximately $7 billion to shareholders through dividends
and share repurchases. And on top of that, we increased the dividend for the 46th
consecutive year. This success was powered by several key traits that have long beenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-01
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 10at the heart of our business. We compete in attractive and growing categories with
leading brands and a broad product portfolio. We have a global footprint with
strong market positions in our largest markets. We have many capabilities from
brand building to route-to-market to R&D that have been built and strengthened
over decades. And we have very large scale that enables very eﬃcient operations.
And most importantly for me, we have dedicated associates who are passionate
about our business. These traits have enabled PepsiCo to consistently perform well
over time, both ﬁnancially and in the marketplace.
Now for the past several months, my leadership team and I have been focused on
how can we build on this extremely strong foundation that we have to take PepsiCo
to even greater heights. We united behind a new mission: To Create More Smiles
with Every Sip and Every Bite. It is our call to action for all of us to run our business in
a way that is simultaneously satisfying and advancing the interest of our consumers,
our customers, associates and communities, planet and the shareholders. We also
united around a new vision, a new vision that captures our competitive spirit, our
intense focus and our shared values, which is: To Be the Global Leader in Convenient
Foods and Beverages by Winning with Purpose. We're energized by both this
mission and this vision because we see a very good organization that can be great.
In particular, we believe we can accelerate top line in a very sustainable way. We can
compete more eﬀectively to win in more of our markets. And we can more rapidly
evolve our capabilities to widen our advantages versus competition.
To achieve these aims, we are committed to 3 clear priorities: becoming Faster,
Stronger and Better in everything we do. We'll become Faster by being much more
consumer-centric and accelerating investments for top line growth and winning in
the marketplace. We'll become Stronger by transforming our capabilities and our
culture. We have already introduced what we call The PepsiCo Way, a new approach
rooted in 7 key behaviors from being consumer-centric and acting as owners to
raising the bar on talent and diversity. And we'll become better by continuing to
integrate Purpose into our business strategy and doing even more for the planet and
for our people. Under my predecessor Indra Nooyi's leadership, Performance with
Purpose became a cornerstone of PepsiCo, guiding our strategy and serving as a
point of true diﬀerentiation for us. We're proud of the progress we've made and
we're equally excited about the continued evolution of our purpose agenda. With
this in mind, we're committing to Winning with Purpose, which will elevate our
sustainability agenda even higher.
Our priorities are clear and your company, from our Board of Directors to our
frontline, is fully committed to achieving those priorities. We are moving forward with
urgency and have ﬁerce competitive drive. And we look forward to writing the next
exciting chapter in this -- in the history of this very iconic company, a history that
begun right here in New Bern, North Carolina.
Thank you very much for the conﬁdence you have placed in us with your investments
and for your continued support of PepsiCo and its leadership. With that, I'll turn it
over to Dave, who'll serve as a Secretary of the meeting and lead us through the
agenda.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-01

Page 5 of 10David Yawmanitems until we actually open the ﬂoor and to please direct your questions only to me.
After we address any questions regarding the agenda items, we'll collect all the
ballots and our Inspectors of Election will tabulate the voting results.
At the end of the meeting, we'll open the ﬂoor to general questions. I'll now turn it
over to Dave to lead us through the agenda.
{BIO 20397577 <GO>}
Thanks, Ramon. Because we did not receive notice of any additional matters to be
considered beyond those items in the proxy statement, no other proposals or
nominations may be introduced at this meeting.
We'll begin with our ﬁrst agenda item, which is the election of Directors. And I place
before the meeting to serve as Directors for the coming year, the 13 individuals
whose names and biographies appear in our proxy statements. Our Board
recommends a vote "for" each of the nominees for a Director.
The second agenda item is the ratiﬁcation of the appointment of KPMG, as the
company's independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for 2019, which I place
before the meeting. Brian Hegarty is here with us representing KPMG. Brian, where
are you? There you go. Thank you, Brian. And he will be available to answer
questions or to make a statement if he would like to do so later in the meeting. Our
Board recommends a vote "for" the ratiﬁcation of the appointment of KPMG as
PepsiCo's independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for 2019.
The third agenda item is the advisory vote to approve the compensation of the
named executive oﬃcers identiﬁed in our proxy statement, which I place before the
meeting. Our Board recommends a vote "for" the advisory resolution to approve
executive compensation.
The fourth item is the approval of amendments to the Articles of Incorporation to
eliminate the supermajority voting standards. Our Board recommends a vote "for"
the resolution to approve these amendments.
And we'll now move on to the shareholder proposals in the order that they appear in
the agenda. Each of the shareholders or their representatives will have 5 minutes to
present their respective proposals. After 5 minutes, you will hear this chime, as an
indication your time is up. If you hear the chime, we would ask that you conclude
your comments.
Now we'll turn to the ﬁrst shareholder proposal requesting that the company adopt
a policy and amend the bylaws requiring the Chair to be an independent member of
the Board. The shareholder proponents' representative from SumOfUs will present
the proposal. And would Rebecca Falcon, please introduce yourself and the
proposal?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-01
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 10Rebecca Falcon
Ramon Luis LaguartaGood morning. My name is Rebecca Falcon. And I'm a Campaign Manager at
SumOfUs, which is a PepsiCo shareholder. I am presenting shareholder proposal #5
for an independent Board Chair, who is not CEO. SumOfUs as a community of 15
million people in 150 countries including at least 2,700 Pepsi shareholders and 2,700
individuals who recently wrote to their pension funds regarding this proposal.
SumOfUs members are committed to curbing abuses of power by corporations. We
want to buy from and invest in companies that respect the environment and treat
their workers fairly. The Board of Directors is supposed to represent us, the
shareholders. And oversee management. But the structure where the top manager,
the CEO, also chairs the Board, is not accountable. And we're not alone in thinking
this. 50% of S&P 500 companies have separated the role of the Chair and CEO. This
is especially important to PepsiCo, as Pepsi is facing mounting criticism over its
association with conﬂict palm oil producer, Indofood, in Indonesia, which former
CEO, Indra Nooyi and now Ramon Laguarta, have both failed to resolve. PepsiCo's
joint venture partner Indofood was recently expelled from the international palm oil
standards body, the RSPO, for exploiting workers, discriminating against female
employees, using child labor, forcing its workers to work in dangerous conditions
and paying below the minimum wage. These allegations are conﬁrmed by an
independent audit, which found over 10 legal oﬀenses that were grave and
methodical breaches of the RSPO Sustainable Palm Oil Policy, standards that
PepsiCo has signed up to. Today is May Day, the International Workers' Day, to
protect workers' rights. Pepsi has a policy on paper against the kind of worker
discrimination happening on Indofood plantations. But in practice, it's not doing
enough.
Independent Board leadership would be an important ﬁrst step to begin to address
these risks. On behalf of SumOfUs members in 150 countries, I'd also like to take this
opportunity to deliver a petition of almost 1 million signatures demanding the
PepsiCo cuts ties with Indofood. Under his leadership, CEO, Ramon Laguarta has
kept Pepsi in a damaging relationship with a company that is notorious for abusing
its workers, including children. And destroying the rainforest and peatlands. This
partnership is having a toxic eﬀect on Pepsi's reputation. And we believe an
independent Chair could hold the CEO to account and protect Pepsi from further
damage. We urge shareholders to vote for proposal #5. And we urge the Board to
adopt to this policy. Thank you.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Thank you, Rebecca. Thanks for your comments. From a governance standpoint, we
have a strong independent Board oversight in our Presiding Director, Ian Cook. And
speciﬁcally, as you said, I believe, on the matters such as the one you are referring to,
palm oil, through our Public Policy and Sustainability Committee, led by Dina
Dublon, who is -- comprised entirely -- that committee by -- of independent
Directors.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-01
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 7 of 10David Yawman
Christy SpeesI think we are also very transparent in our use of palm oil. And we'll talk more later,
probably. But we provide extensive disclosure on our website including a progress
report about our use of palm oil and then we have been recognized by the World
Wildlife Fund for leading the way on sustainable palm oil. Our governance
documents allow the Board the ﬂexibility to determine whether the roles of the
Chairman and the CEO should be separate or combined based on company's
needs. And we believe it is critical for our Board to retain that ﬂexibility to choose the
most eﬀective way for the leadership structure of PepsiCo. And that is the reason
why we recommend a vote against that proposal. Thank you.
{BIO 20397577 <GO>}
The second shareholder proposal on the ballot is requesting that PepsiCo disclose
quantitative metrics that demonstrate that we are making progress towards reducing
the use of pesticides in our supply chain. The shareholder proponents'
representative from As You Sow will present the proposal. Would Christy Spees
please introduce yourself and the proposal?
Good morning. Thank you, PepsiCo Board members, shareholders and management
team. My name is Christy Spees. And I'm here today to present shareholder proposal
#6. This proposal asks the company to disclose data which demonstrate the long-
term reduction in the use of chemical pesticides in the agricultural supply chains for
PepsiCo products. As many of you know, after reading the proxy statement for this
year, PepsiCo has developed a commitment to what they're calling Winning with
Purpose, which builds on a foundation of sustainability. This strategy is based on the
principle that environmental sustainability will lead to long-term ﬁnancial
sustainability for the company and its investors. We commend the company for
making this commitment and we also thank the PepsiCo leadership for its continued
eﬀorts to do business sustainably and for engaging with shareholders on
sustainability concerns. The issue of chemical pesticides speciﬁcally, however,
currently represents a signiﬁcant blind spot in the company's sustainability reporting.
PepsiCo's Quaker Oats brand has been in the media spotlight multiple times after
residues of the controversial chemical glyphosate has been found in Quaker
products. Glyphosate is the main ingredient in common weed killer Round Up,
originally marketed by the agrochemical industry as being "As safe as table salt".
Science now demonstrates substantial risks posed by this chemical to human health
and to the environment. In fact, glyphosate is currently classiﬁed by the World Health
Organization as a probable human carcinogen and is classiﬁed by the State of
California as a known carcinogen. Consumers are increasingly demanding clean,
safe products that are sustainably produced. PepsiCo's -- if PepsiCo were to fail to
adequately address the use of chemicals on its agricultural ingredients, this would
pose a threat to the company's reputation and growth. Consumer concern about
pesticide toxins has led to numerous class action lawsuits already against food
manufacturers, petitions to the EPA to increase federal regulation and proposed
legislation at the state, local and federal levels to restrict the use of these chemicals.
PepsiCo has not yet demonstrated a committed eﬀort to address this particular
growing problem or the harmful eﬀects of pesticide exposure to consumers, the
environment and the farm workers and communities impacted by its agriculturalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-01

David Yawmansupply chains. As long-term investors in PepsiCo, we seek to ensure that the
company is adequately managing all public health and environmental impacts of its
agriculture supply chains as well as the related risks to the company's reputation and
business. By tracking and reporting data regarding chemical use on the company's
supplier farms, PepsiCo can demonstrate to shareholders that -- as well as to
consumers that it is successfully addressing these concerns. PepsiCo is one of the
largest food and beverage companies in the United States, which I'm sure I don't
have to tell you. We believe that the company would best serve all of its stakeholders
by using its market power to promote a food system that is healthier for people, the
environment and the long-term value of its brands. Thank you.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Thank you, Christy. And thank you for coming all the way here. We've had I think
considerable engagement with your company -- your organization on this matter
and some other matters. Let me take here just a minute to share with you what is the
Board's position on this topic, which you can read also about it in the proxy
statement. We think that we have robust programs and policies on food safety and
sustainable agriculture to address the concerns that you're talking about, about
pesticide using by farmers. We also provide signiﬁcant disclosure on our website
including a statement on pesticides that includes data on practices our farmers are
using to optimize pesticide use. We believe our integrated pest management
program reduces the use of pesticides on our supply chain. And we can track
compliance with the program as a means of assessing our progress in reducing
pesticides, addressing the reporting called for in this proposal. We also believe at
the same time that the company should have the ﬂexibility to further develop our
policies and procedures in a way that we consider to be the most eﬃcient and
eﬀective. So for these reasons, the Board believes that the reporting called for in this
proposal is neither necessary, nor a good use of company's resources. I recommend
that shareholders do not support this proposal.
{BIO 20397577 <GO>}
Thank you, Ramon. We've now heard the 6 agenda items. Are there any questions
about any of the 6 agenda items we just reviewed? And as a reminder, we will open
the ﬂoor to general questions on other topics at the end of the meeting. If anybody
does have a question, please raise your hand. Thank you. Has anyone -- has
everyone voted who wishes to do so? I know we passed out a series of ballots
before. If there are any ballots outstanding at this time, I see some being collected.
Looks like we just about have them all. Thank you, everybody. We seem to have all
the ballots and since all those desiring to vote have now done so. I will ask our
Inspectors of Election to please close the polls.
I now declare the polls to be closed.

{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Great commercials. So now Dave Yawman, the Corporate Secretary, will announce
the preliminary results of the ballot.
{BIO 20397577 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to report the preliminary results of the voting. On
ballot item #1, with respect to the nominees for Director, I'd like to report that all
Director nominees have been duly elected by the aﬃrmative vote of a majority of the
votes cast. On ballot item #2, the appointment of KPMG LLP, as our independent
registered public accounting ﬁrm for 2019, that item has been ratiﬁed by the
aﬃrmative vote of approximately 97% of the votes cast. On ballot item #3, the
advisory vote on executive compensation, it has been approved on an advisory basis
by the aﬃrmative vote of approximately 93% of the votes cast. On ballot item #4, the
amendments to the Articles of Incorporation to eliminate the supermajority voting
standards, it has received the support of approximately 70% of the issued and
outstanding Common Stock and thus received enough votes to pass. Ballot item #5,
a shareholder proposal regarding independent Board Chairman has received
support of approximately 25% of the votes cast and thus did not receive enough
votes to pass. And on ballot item #6, a shareholder proposal regarding disclosure of
pesticide management data, that has received support of approximately 11% of the
votes cast and thus did not receive enough votes to pass.
Again, I remind you, these are preliminary voting results and ﬁnal results will be
available after the votes have been certiﬁed by our Inspectors of Election. The ﬁnal
results will be disclosed on a Form 8-K that will be ﬁled with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. Mr. Chairman?
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Thank you, Dave. So all of the proposals eligible for consideration by the
shareholders at this annual meeting has been presented. The formal business
portion of the meeting now is adjourned. I thank you all for your time and attention
today.
