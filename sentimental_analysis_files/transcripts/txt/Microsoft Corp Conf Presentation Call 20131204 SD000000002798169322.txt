So we will get started here. And I thank everyone for joining us early in the morning.
I am Keith Weiss. I run the US Software Group at Morgan Stanley. And we are very
pleased to have with us opening up this morning Chris Suh, General Manager,
Investor Relations, from Microsoft.
So Chris, maybe an opening question just about the overall environment. If we look
at the last two quarters from Microsoft -- June quarter, which was perhaps a little bit
below all your guys' expectations; a really nice rebound in September quarter. How
much is that talking about the overall spending environment? How much is that
talking about Microsoft was operating better in the September quarter?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
It's a good question. But before I get to that, I think I need to cover our forward-
looking statement just real quick, if you don't mind. So during the course of our
conversation, I may make some forward-looking statements, which are predictions or
projections about future events. Those statements are based on current expectations
and assumptions, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, obviously.
Microsoft doesn't take -- actual results could materially diﬀer and Microsoft doesn't
undertake any duty to update that forward-looking statement. So sorry, I had to
cover on that.
So I think your question was sort of Q4 to Q1, some of the business trends that we
are seeing. So yes, I think you stated it right. Q4 did come in below where we were
expecting. And then, conversely, Q1 came in a bit stronger than we were expecting.
I think if I reﬂect back on sort of those two quarters and what happened, Q4 we saw
to be a bit of a low point in terms of what we saw in our Windows business
speciﬁcally related to OEMs. So if you recall, in Q4, our OEM business ﬁnished
declining 15% year-over-year. And we saw particularly a declining portion of the
business in the consumer side of our OEM business. At that time, we setFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04

Chris Suhexpectations for Q1 to be similar Q4 to Q1 trend along the PC market, because that
was the indicator that we were seeing.
As we proceeded into Q1, the PC market speciﬁcally actually ﬁnished a little bit
better. We ﬁnished Q1 OEM revenue down 7% year-over-year versus 15%. And as you
know, that OEM business is a highly proﬁtable portion of our business. So 8 points of
improvement relative to our expectations on OEM results and a lot of EPS uplift
relative to expectations.
Now, again, we saw the two diﬀerent trends. We saw our business Pro SKU -- what we
call the Windows Pro SKU, which attaches to PCs that typically go into businesses --
we saw that business growing 6% in Q1, the second consecutive quarter of growth.
So a positive trend. And I think we're feel pretty good about the trajectory there.
Then we saw the consumer side ﬁnish about negative 22% -- that is the non-Pro SKUs
-- in Q1. Again, a little bit better than we expected. But really that was the biggest
diﬀerence, I think, Q4 to Q1. And I think it is a trend that we think will generally
persist for the time being.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Excellent. Bigger picture. So you stepped into the role of General Manager of
Investor Relations pretty much at this time last year.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
It was January, right around our January earnings call.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
And you stepped in ahead of what turned out to be a pretty signiﬁcant year of
change for Microsoft in terms of a signiﬁcant reorganization that you guys
announced, a new CFO, Steve Ballmer announcing he was going to step down. And
the announcement of the Nokia acquisition.
Should we look at -- looking ahead, a lot of moving pieces in calendar year 2013.
Calendar year 2014, are you expecting more stability, more sort of building out on
those pieces? Does Microsoft have what it needs -- outside of a CEO right now -- but
outside of a CEO have what it needs to move forward with the devices and services
strategy?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yes. It's a great question. And, yes, it was right at -- right before our January earnings
call that I stepped into it. I have been around the Company for about 17 years. So I
have had a good sort of perspective of Microsoft from the inside. But certainly didn't
expect the amount of change that I have seen over the last 10 months that I have
been in this role. It has been super fascinating, actually. And I keep telling peopleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 12Keith Weissthat my boss and my boss's boss quitting has nothing to do with me. But it has been
fascinating.
And we are actually quite enthused about the changes that are in process and the
changes to come and the opportunity ahead. I think there are a few diﬀerent
categories, as you sort of mentioned. The organizational change, the realignment,
the what we call One Microsoft, that has only been in place for a couple of months
now, actually. But we are already starting to see a lot of the beneﬁts of that change.
And I think there is a lot more beneﬁt to come.
If I think about -- what we eﬀectively did was we moved from ﬁve distinct divisions,
what we call product groups, which had their own divisional president, which had
their own P&L and their own CFO and their own marketing organization, which was
put into place almost 10 years ago. At that time, the product groups were functioning
as almost distinct, separate products. But as we move forward into the future, as you
think about cloud devices and services, along the backside, we share data centers,
we share resources, we share a lot of operations, it made a lot of sense to bring
those together and help those teams work together more closely.
And so by moving to a more functional model where we have the R&D organizations
collaborating across the Company well, we brought all ﬁve marketing organizations
into a single marketing organization to tell a more integrated, cohesive story about
our oﬀerings and services. And we took out some of the P&L incentives that existed
across ﬁve diﬀerent divisions that were based on their own division's performance
versus the Company in total.
So I think you are already starting to see -- we are internally already starting to see
the beneﬁts of that. And externally, even some of the messaging that we did around
some of the new product launches at holiday have been, I think, better as a result.
Obviously some big changes yet to come, the biggest one being the next great
leader for Microsoft. We are a unique Company in that we have only had two CEOs
in our history. And both gentlemen. I think -- I think you can't argue that they are two
people that were incredibly passionate about Microsoft and still are. And so I think
they are taking the time -- the Board is taking the time to ﬁnd the right next leader,
make sure the Company is in the right hands.
Do we have all the -- I think your last question was do we have all the pieces in place.
I think we do. I think the devices and services strategy is well underway. Obviously,
the next CEO of Microsoft will have a great impact on how we proceed from here.
And we are all eager to see what comes with that.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
And just maybe too mark-to-market on some of those initiatives, how should we
think of -- in terms of the transition or sort the work to be done towards Microsoft
One, how far into that initiative is Microsoft, how much more change is on the come?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04

Page 4 of 12Chris Suh
Keith WeissAnd maybe if you could dig into -- just give us some examples of some of the
beneﬁts that you guys are already seeing internally.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Sure. It is early. I mean, in the grand scheme of things, I think it is early. I think it really
is a deep integration. It is not just about -- I will use the OS team as an example of
that. So previously -- so under Terry Myerson now, he runs all of our operating
systems groups, which is operating systems for phone, operating systems for PC and
tablets, operating systems for Xbox. It is operating systems that go into embedded
devices. So all ﬂavors of OS. Those previously sat in diﬀerent parts of the
organization. So we had a phone OS team building the Windows phone OS. And we
had the Windows PC teams that were building in a diﬀerent organization. And they
really were built independent of each other in many ways.
So what Terry has done isn't just to take those organizations and put them side by
side and put them under the same umbrella. But there is actually a single
engineering team now across the whole OS, a single R&D leader, a single test dev
PM lead, which is sort of the three-headed leadership in an R&D organization, that
has responsibility for all the OSes and they are going to rationalize the thinking
across do three, four, ﬁve OSes make sense. Ultimately, when we think about
Microsoft's strategy of having sort of this uniﬁed experience across devices, maybe
you don't need as many OSes as we currently have. But those are the types of things
that are currently under development.
So I would say it is still early because you don't make those type of decisions quickly.
But we are a couple months in and I think we are making progress along those lines.
Another area that I will point to is marketing. So we had, like I said, ﬁve diﬀerent
marketing organizations. At the end of the day, it is the same customer. So we would
have an oﬃce marketing team that is creating marketing materials for the same
enterprise customer that the server and tools team was creating marketing for. And
creating messaging and the whole go-to-market strategies.
What we have done now is put all those marketing organizations into a single team.
There is eﬀectively one team that focuses on the enterprise and there is one team
that focuses on consumer. And they are doing a lot better job already aligning some
of those things. Like even some of the Surface messaging that you see today, I think
when we ﬁrst initially launched Surface, a lot of it was -- a lot of the marketing was
targeted toward raising awareness of the product itself. But I think the marketing that
you see today focuses a lot on the diﬀerentiated features and functionality, the
productivity, the fact that you can have Oﬃce and the fact that you can use USB. And
all these things that sort of articulate the value proposition diﬀerently than a year
ago.

Chris SuhGot it, got it. Then just the latest update on how you guys are messaging the CEO
search and the timing that investors should be expecting there.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yes. I think the most recent public statement was actually made by Bill Gates himself
at our annual meeting of shareholders, which we held in November. So Bill gave an
update. And that is still available on our replay on our website, the Microsoft IR
website, if you want to go take a look.
Largely talked about the progress that is being made. Just to recap a little bit, we
have a four-person CEO search committee, a subset of the Board. That is Bill Gates;
that is our lead independent director, John Thompson; it is Chuck Noski; and it is
Steven Luczo. Those 4 gentlemen have eﬀectively been working with internal
candidates as well as external candidates to ultimately come up with a short list. And
that short list will then be vetted and interviewed and the entire Board will vote on
the selection of the next candidate.
As Bill said in his update, the Board has been working very hard to come up with --
and met with a lot of internal and externals and are coming up with that short list.
They are aware that everyone would like them to move expeditiously. At the same
time, as Bill stated, he cares so deeply about this Company he is going to make sure
that it is the right next leader and they are going to take the time to do so.
So we didn't provide any sort of updated timeline. But at the time of Steve's
announcement, we said 12 months. I don't think it will go 12 months. But the Board is
working very, very hard on it right now.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. Excellent. There has been a lot of speculation on what could happen
potentially under a new CEO. One of the ideas that we hear a lot about is the
potential of spinning out some divisions. Speciﬁcally, what you hear about most
often is the potential of perhaps spinning out Xbox, perhaps spinning out the Bing
division.
I doubt you are going to comment on whether anyone is going to be spinning out
the Xbox division or the Bing division. But maybe to just help investors think about it
in context, maybe you can walk through how you guys think about today of Xbox in
terms of the integration and how that relates to other parts of the consumer
business, what the overall vision is for Xbox. So we get an understanding of what it
would mean to actually spin that out.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Sure. I have seen some of the headlines as well. It is interesting. I think we have been
pretty consistent with our stated strategy statements, which is to become a devices
and services company. I think our actions have also been consistent along with thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 12Keith Weissin terms of moving from a pure software company to both software, services and
devices.
When I think about the two speciﬁc assets that you mentioned, Bing and Xbox, I do
think they are an integral part of how we think about how we are successful in the
future. So when we think about how Microsoft continues to grow and deliver the next
wave of growth, it is important -- it is important for us that we stay relevant with users.
And those aren't just users that are quote, unquote, business users, or quote,
unquote, consumers.
I think in today's world, the way people engage with technology and the way people
use technology, it is more evident that there aren't speciﬁc experiences that they do
at work and then they leave all those behind, or vice versa, at play and then they
leave those behind as well. Skype is a great example of that. And I think even iPhone
-- well, not even -- but iPhone is a great example of people that bring their consumer
-- what started as a consumer device into the workplace. And now we are certainly
seeing that phenomenon.
So I think Xbox and Bing both ﬁt into that category. When I think about Bing, for
example, there is Bing.com the search engine. There is also deep, deep integration
of Bing into phone, into mobile, into Windows 8. So if you have used Windows 8 and
8.1, if you swipe in from the right you come up with the search charms. And that
search is really deeply integrated with Bing.
With Xbox, you got integration of Bing there. Then you can also imagine in the future
a lot of scenarios for productivity and enterprise that involve deep integration with
search. So Bing is both the Bing.com search engine. But there is also a back-end
asset that we share across the portfolio that accrues a lot of value to the rest of the
portfolio.
Xbox is along the same lines. Xbox -- at the end of the day, I talked about at the
beginning Microsoft wants to provide that uniﬁed experience across devices, from a
four-inch phone to an 80-inch TV and everything in between. And increasingly, we
see sort of blurring the lines of diﬀerence between the tablet and a PC and a tablet
and a phone. And ultimately a tablet and a desktop and we have got 27-inch all-in-
ones now. That and the TV, those experiences are starting to blur.
With Xbox One, you see that there is a great gaming experience that we launched
when we launched Xbox One a couple of weeks ago. But you also see that there is a
deep -- the deep roots in Windows. You see the Windows UI there. You see deep
integration with Skype and SkyDrive. You have all your stuﬀ there, the native
interaction with the TV through voice and gestures. It is quite a seamless set of
experiences across the whole stack. And we think that is important, again, to win the
minds of consumers, in a sense. And have that engagement and stay relevant across
the whole portfolio.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 12Chris SuhAnd it seems like Xbox One has gotten a really nice initial reception. Some of the
initial sales ﬁgures that at least we are seeing from retail suggest a really good
market reception thus far.
So maybe digging in a little bit into some of the divisions, talk about Windows.
Around this time last year, Microsoft released Windows 8. Initially, I think the
distribution and the reception of Windows 8 didn't really reinvigorate the PC market
as expected. Pulp was kind of pushed forward to 8.1, to the emergence of new
touchscreen devices.
How has that progression been going? How are you guys viewing the holiday
season? Do you think we are there yet with the sort of ecosystem, the chipsets, the
touchscreen devices?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
You know, I think at the highest level, we are pleased with the progress from the last
year to where we are today. You are right. I mean, it is an incredibly broad and
complicated, complex ecosystem. And that is not just a statement about OEMs. But
the whole supply chain, as you talked about, from chips to retail all the way through,
end to end.
And I think about a lot of the improvements that we have made from a year ago. I
think just starting with the OEMs. I think the selection of PCs that you are seeing on
the shelves today or this holiday is vastly improved. Better battery management, a lot
of really good price points that are available either online or through retail. We are
seeing sort of the whole complement of equipment ﬁll in nicely and we are really
happy about that.
You know, with Windows 8.1, what we have done by releasing Windows 8.1 less than
a year after Windows 8, which is a ﬁrst for us, quite honestly, shows I think a little bit
of the faster cadence in terms of delivering innovation that we have been working
on. Windows 8.1 takes a lot of the feedback from Windows 8, a lot of learning that we
got ourselves from doing Surface. We touched on that brieﬂy a little bit ago. But just
by doing our own hardware, where we are really working to integrate the software
with the hardware and understanding that at a deeper level than we ever have
before, I think there was some learning that certainly got into Windows 8.1.
So when I look at the ecosystem broadly, we have done a lot of stuﬀ at retail. In the
US, we have these store-in-stores at Best Buys, which is our big retail presence. So on
the retail side, on the supply chain side, on the distribution side, on the product side;
so everything is moving in the right direction.
Now that said, I think it still takes a little bit of time and I think Windows 8.1 and the
adoption and deployment across is still a work in process. And we are more
optimistic certainly.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04

Chris Suh{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it, excellent, excellent. And maybe shifting gears a little bit to Surface, it has
been out over a year now. You have Surface 2 on the market. How do you guys feel
about the momentum behind that tablet? I don't know if it is a tablet. How you feel
about the momentum behind Surface 2?
And the corollary question, I think one of the initial goals of Surface was to show the
other OEMs what you can do with Windows 8. So how you could extend the form
factor. How have the OEMs responded (multiple speakers)?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yes. It is a great question. And you are right. I think -- it was interesting, when you sort
of called it a tablet, then you sort of tried to say, well, is it a tablet or not, because I
think that is part of the interesting thing of what Surface is.
When we ﬁrst did Surface -- or really when the ﬁrst idea of Surface came to be, which
came in sort of side-by-side with the development of Windows 8 in many ways, it
was meant to be, as you said, sort of a stage for all the great things that Windows 8
could do. It was meant to show that it could be a great productivity tool. But also --
when you attach the keyboard to it. But when you take it away, it is a great -- it comes
with the simplicity of a tablet and all the work and play combined in one great
device.
I think to a large degree, I think with the ﬁrst Surface we did learn a lot about that. I
mean, I talked about the learning of just building a piece of hardware and making it
work with our software ourselves. Which is -- in the past, we have never -- we've had
teams that worked closely with OEMs. But it is diﬀerent when you actually build a
piece of hardware optimized for a piece of software.
So I think we learned a lot from that. That has gone into the second generation of
Surface products. I think the new Surface -- they are lighter, they are better power
management with Windows 8.1. It is a little more optimized with the
hardware/software experience. So I think, again, it tends to be a work in process. But
we are really happy with the direction that we have made and the improvements that
we made in the product.
It is a little early to have any sort of momentum yet on the second product. I think it is
really targeted for this holiday, the second generation of Surface. But we are happy
with the direction that we have gone.
You know, as I said, we are seeing a lot of innovation from OEMs. Whether they are
two-in-ones, which are kind of like the Surface -- they are tablets and they are
hybrids, Ultrabooks and touchscreen -- the OEM partners have been great. And we
are certainly working together with them closely to help invigorate the whole
ecosystem in total. So our OEM relationships are good and solid (multiple speakers).FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04

So I think the fear was that you guys coming out with your own hardware devices
would perhaps change relationship with OEMs, they'd feel a little bit more
threatened by, well, of course, you could do the hardware and software better than
they can do. You don't think you saw any of that kind of (inaudible)?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
No. I think it is interesting. And I think it always -- there is a healthy amount of
partnership and there is also a healthy amount of collaboration across various types
of devices and product families. End-to-end, I think we have a good relationship with
OEMs. I think that we are partnering well together for this holiday for sure.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Excellent. I have a ton more questions. But I want to make sure we take time to take
questions from the audience. Any questions from the audience before I continue?
Excellent. So Microsoft is a big Company to cover in half an hour. So I am going to
skip around a little bit. And I want to make sure we focus -- or talk a little bit about
the enterprise. In particular some of the activities that you guys have been doing in
the cloud. One of the, I think, most interesting aspects of what Microsoft has been
doing on the enterprise is Azure.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Can you walk us through sort of how Azure has been tracking? Number one, there
are some really interesting data points you guys have been putting out about some
pretty rapid adoption. And two, how should investors think about Azure in terms of a
competitive environment between Azure and AWS and now Google in the
marketplace and maybe IBM with SoftLayer coming into the market. How do you
guys see that competitive environment evolving?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Azure is an exciting part of our overall cloud strategy. So Microsoft is -- we have been
investing in cloud for a long, long time. We took a very -- I guess an ambitious
approach with our platform-as-a-service oﬀering with Azure. But our cloud initiatives
across Azure. But also Oﬃce 365 and various other parts of the businesses, we're
sort of all into the cloud I guess in that sense.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 12Keith Weiss
Chris SuhI think of Azure in a couple diﬀerent ways. First of all, I think we do have a
diﬀerentiated solution vis-a-vis an AWS in a couple ways. I think of our -- with Azure,
what you get is really what we call a hybrid cloud approach. So you have the ability
to run your platform on your data center, on our data center, on a partner's data
center. And it is sort of -- we are sort of agnostic to that. It works well across all of it
with a common management and security layer. And so I think that diﬀerentiated
approach, whether you want to host it or whether we do, provides a unique value
proposition.
I would also say that Microsoft has a deep, deep history with working with enterprise
companies, with CIOs, with data centers; we have 30-plus years working well with
enterprise companies. I think a lot of that sort of the credibility that we have built
over many, many years is helping us with our progress in terms of building Azure
and our customer adoption in that sense.
I would say if I look across our entire cloud portfolio, you have got Oﬃce 365, which
is probably a little bit further along the maturity curve versus an Azure. But Azure is
growing very, very quickly. This last quarter, we talked about the growth in our total
commercial cloud revenue, which is Azure and Oﬃce 365 together, being up 103%
year over year. Azure customers were up over 200%. And we are adding a lot of new
customers daily.
It is a business that is on a fast trajectory. We are also investing in those businesses,
as you know, continuing to build out our data centers ahead of the anticipated
demand curve for Azure. But really, I mean, cloud is probably the most exciting thing
that we have going at Microsoft across both of the Oﬃce and Windows server -- I
mean the Azure -- Windows, Azure divisions.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
One of the things you talked about at the Investor Day was there is a very fast pace
of growth in both the cloud oﬀerings. And it takes some CapEx investment. How
should investors think about sort of the level of CapEx investment that we are going
to see in the coming year? But more so, how does that sustain over time? Is it an
arms race between you guys and AWS and IBM of where it's really going to be about
building out signiﬁcant capacity over the next several years?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
I mean, I do think that there is a bit of an arms race, as you said, to build a bigger,
better, faster data center, I guess. We are certainly making investments in our data
center. It really started in FY13, where we -- our historical CapEx spend was closer to -
- or under $3 billion in some cases. But closer to $3 billion. In FY13, we went a little
bit north of $4 billion. And the current ﬁscal year, we are anticipating spending about
$6.5 billion. So it is a big step up. And most of the diﬀerence -- if I sort of take the
historical run rate of CapEx to now, I think most of the diﬀerential is in the data
center side, is in networking equipment as well as some of the plant to host those
servers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 12Keith Weiss
Chris SuhWe are investing in three areas primarily. You saw -- and I am going back to the start
of the ramp in FY13 -- Oﬃce 365. And that is coming up to scale; we talked about
that business being over a $1.5 billion run rate at the end of ﬁscal 2013. So that is now
a pretty sizable business coming to scale and we are starting to see the beneﬁts of
that.
The two other areas of investment are actually the two businesses we have talked
about, which is Bing and it's Azure. And people say well, Bing -- they are not
surprised at the Azure one. But they are curious about what we are investing in Bing.
And the way to think about Bing in terms of the investment is that we have a good
presence in the US with Bing.com, the search engine. We have 18% share now. But
the global footprint for Bing is still growing and so we want to invest in Bing.com
globally.
At the same time, the growth in mobile, we talk about Bing being the back-end
search engine for Windows 8, for mobile, for Xbox, all those things require more
investment in the data center on the Bing side.
Then Azure, now Azure is interesting, because we do think that we are investing a
little bit ahead of the curve in terms of what we expect the revenues and scale to
come. So when you asked about what is the right sustained level of investment, I
think investors often think about CapEx as a percentage of the revenue. So when I
look at FY14, I would say that the CapEx is probably on an absolute dollar sort of at a
level where I could foresee us continuing to invest in. At the same time, the revenue
scale isn't there yet. So the revenue on Azure speciﬁcally will increase over time,
where we may not necessarily need to invest more. It will just depend on how
quickly -- how accurate we are in forecasting the demand curve on Azure.
So I would say that right now we have investment without revenue on Azure, or less
revenue; I think it is out of scale. But in the future, that should normalize a little bit
more.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Then one last question on perhaps bringing together a couple of these
(inaudible) the margin impact. When we think about an elevated CapEx investment
for all the cloud activities, we think about Surface, which is now selling hardware as
well as software. And an Xbox release, Xbox One release, how should investors be
thinking about the gross margin impacts of these investments throughout this ﬁscal
year (multiple speakers)?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Sure. I think this ﬁscal year is interesting, because we do have an Xbox One launch.
And that is having a weight -- probably a heavier weight. And as you know, in the
gaming business, the lifecycle of a gaming console is you tend to have low or
negative margins upfront and then those improve over time. And so FY14 is probably
overweighted a little bit with the Xbox One launch.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 12 of 12Keith Weiss
Chris SuhBut I think that your general point is right. As we evolve from a higher-margin
software business to services and hardware, we are going to have margin
percentage impacts of those things. I think over time, we are conﬁdent that we can
deliver more gross margin dollars, absolute gross margin. But the percentages will
change.
I think the way that I would recommend folks look at it is you look at the new
reporting segments that we have started in FY14. And you really have -- there is ﬁve
segments. But there is really three categories of gross margin proﬁles within those
ﬁve segments. There is two segments that are called licensing -- device and
consumer licensing and commercial licensing. And both of those have more historic
software-type gross margins. You have an entire segment devoted to hardware. So
you can really track the progress in hardware segment within the segment. Then you
have a segment that we call commercial other, which houses all of our Azure and
Oﬃce 365 revenue and gross margin.
And so again, you could see sort of the margin proﬁle, like-to-like, year-over-year
within those segments. And I think in some years, the mix of the business will be
diﬀerent, like we will have more Xbox this year. But in some cases, the mix -- so the
mix will aﬀect the overall gross margin. But you can really see within those segments
how we are doing from a gross margin perspective.
