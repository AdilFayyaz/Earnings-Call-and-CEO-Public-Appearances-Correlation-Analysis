Presentation
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Welcome, everyone. My name is Brent Thill. I run the software group at Jeﬀeries. I'm
joined by Alex, my partner, who runs the gaming segment for us. We want to
welcome you and bring in Tim Stuart from Microsoft. Tim's the CFO and runs a lot of
other things related to the gaming business inside Microsoft. He's been there a short
18 years and six months, and he has phenomenal experience. We know the Masters
is kicking oﬀ on ESPN on the other side of this, so Tim is very conﬁdent, we'll hold a
higher court than Tiger Woods.
Tim, thanks for joining. We're obviously riding the launch here. Maybe just bring us
up to speed on the strategy this cycle, what you're seeing so far. You won't take my
money right now. So everyone's asking, when are we actually going to be able to get
these?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yeah, I wish I had some handouts for the show here. No, I think that it's a very unique
time in gaming in general, as we know, with the pandemic going on and other
things. But also, as you look over the last four or ﬁve years, just a very big change in
gaming. We think about subscriptions, when you think about digital, when you think
about new consoles, I love where we're at in terms of how we got here.
So your point is exactly right. Two days ago, we launched Xbox Series X and Xbox
Series S. It's our biggest launch we've ever done in terms of units and geographies
and our overall footprint and activations. So super excited about where we're at. And
I love the price points, and I love the SKU proﬁle we picked, $499 on the top end for
Xbox Series X, the world's most powerful console. And then we have Xbox Series S, I
like to call it the world's best value in gaming, really to bring forward a lot of those
purchasers that would normally wait for price points to come down. We feel like we
want to remove some of that friction, bring forward a lot of those users, bring
forward a lot of those people that would come late in the generation. And maybeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-12

Brent John Thillthat contributes a little bit to your inability to ﬁnd a console now. But really, out of the
gate, launched with the right price point, the right power proﬁle and the right
content oﬀerings that diﬀerentiate us.
So I like where we're at. I like the launch and I love how it sets up -- and we can talk
about this later. I love how it sets up Game Pass and game streaming and really kind
of starting where our strategy will go for Microsoft in the future.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Many ask what makes this round diﬀerent? You are a lover of golf, it seems like.
You're going into this round versus last round. What is diﬀerent about this round that
you've tried I to work on going into this?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. We always look for technological shifts to launch new consoles. And when you
look at these consoles, it's things like fast load times. I have an Xbox Series S right
here next to my PC. I won't play it right now. When we think about getting into
games almost instantaneously. When you think about raytracing, you think about
RDNA, you think about running a game at 120 frames a second and 4K. It's the
technology around these boxes that really is magical.
And unleashes, really, creatives and content creators to really reach new things we
haven't seen before in terms of ﬁdelity, in terms of how things look and how things
play, number of players you can put on a screen, a number of things you can load
much quicker. So, a, I love the technology that we're ushering in; b, it's the
experiences. It's things like we have Xbox All Access, which is the ability for us to
combine Game Pass plus a hardware purchase into a $24.99 a month, a $34.99 a
month subscription. So you can get hardware plus services together, which is
something unlike we haven't had in the past. And so now we can sell through new
distribution, we can sell through Telstra in Australia. We can sell through mobile
operators here in the U.S. So I love that pricing diﬀerentiation.
And then lastly is Game Pass, something we haven't had in the past. With Game Pass,
you can get in for $9.99 a month. And if you're a new to the console player, you can
get hundreds of great games out of the gate with the console that you've purchased,
which is something we haven't had in the past. So the ability for someone to get into
a console to play games that you -- look amazing and have never been seen like this
before and have access to a content catalog that is bigger than we've ever had, I
think, is going to be kind of the one, two, thre punch of why this console's going to
be very diﬀerent than the past.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
There's obviously incredible demand. You had a sold-out of all the preorders. And I
think everyone's kind of asking how you think about the ongoing supply that you
can bring to the market. Can you just give us a high level -- I know you're not goingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 15Tim Stuart
Brent John Thill
Tim Stuartto give speciﬁcs, but just high level, how you're meeting this incredible demand
from your side?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. It's something we look at all the time. You wish you had supply to meet the huge
demand. I think what we've seen over the last generation and then heading into now
is -- and part of this demand proﬁle is, frankly, gaming is just exploding. It's a $200
billion a year industry. And so kids, adults, male, female, young, old, whatever it is,
are games. And so that drives that demand proﬁle, which we love to see.
From a supply perspective, you're absolutely right. For Q2, we gave guidance at our
last earnings call of a zone that we'll be in. And we'll, frankly, be within that zone
because we know the supply proﬁle that we're having. I think we'll continue to see
supply shortages as we head into the post-holiday quarter, so Microsoft's Q3,
calendar Q1. And then when we get to Q4, all of our supply chain continuing to go
full speed heading into kind of the pre-summer months.
And that's where I start to -- I expect to see a little bit of the demand -- the supply
proﬁle, meeting the demand proﬁle. You'll be outside of a holiday window. We'll
have supply cranking over the next, what, four, ﬁve, six months. And that's when I
expect to see really that demand proﬁle start to be met, which will be really, really
great. And really, what that's going to do is, once we get into that world of a great
high end, call it, a great high-powered console, plus that lower-end SKU for value, I
think we're going to start to see some real velocity kick up, which I'm really excited to
see.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
You got a lot of help with the rest of Microsoft. When you think about the impact that
Azure and the rest of the stack is giving you, one of the questions we continue to get
is the impact of the cloud and how the cloud is going to play into the future of
gaming and in what your parent is doing to enable you to get to where you want.
Can you just talk about where we're at today with the cloud? And where do you think
we're at 3 to 5 years out, how impactful is cloud gaming going to be?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. Yes. I think -- so number one on the -- I'll say on the Microsoft side, having an
Azure cloud, having a ﬁrst-party cloud is going to give us something that's uniquely
diﬀerentiated versus anybody else in this space. Kind of the combination of our
content pipeline plus Game Pass, plus the cloud, which gives us the ability to stream
games to, I'll say, any end points that can take a signal is going to be massively
diﬀerentiated versus others in the industry. So I love that perspective. And I love
having kind of that Microsoft drive with our geographic footprint with Azure. So I
think point one is going to be, that's going to be so great.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 15Brent John Thill
Tim StuartAzure also gives us the ability to reach something like 80% of the gamers in the
world will be within an Azure-served zone. It allows us to go into Africas and Indias
and stream games into places that are not console-ﬁrst and maybe not even PC-ﬁrst,
but they're for sure mobile-ﬁrst. And that's going to be a very, very unique place to
be, which Microsoft gives us the ability to go do. I'll say in addition to that -- I'm
going to kind of jump your question a little bit. Is 5G. 5G, combined with Azure in
those regions, will be a huge bonus for us, which is we can now hit those markets
with low-latency gaming with compute that's happening pretty close to those
gamers with that Azure data center. And that will usher in new distribution models,
but more importantly, it will give us that ability to go drive a mobile-ﬁrst customer or
a mobile kind of main customer.
If you think about console market being: 200 million or 300 million players; the PC
markets, 200 million or 300 million players; that mobile market is billions plus. And
Brent, to your question, how important is that audience? I think Microsoft's scale, our
ability to go from -- we're 15 million Game Pass subscribers today to 25 million, 50
million, 100 million is going to require that mobile audience to be achieved by us.
And that's where we're going to have to have a content pipeline that supports that
amount of users. But to your question, having that cloud streaming ability will be
needed to go reach customers at that scale for sure.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Well, another question just around kind of the content. And you -- your division got
the largest acquisition of the year, $7.5 billion, obviously, a key component. Can you
just talk to us about what's happening in the content industry? And what you think is
happening? Some of the larger players have said they're going to raise prices. Any
thought around just content and then the ability to actually raise prices given all the
dynamics that seem right for that type of backdrop to do that?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. It's -- from a content perspective, it's a great time to be a content owner, for sure.
And you can look at valuations as one example of these companies. But more
importantly, it's the -- two things are happening, number one is gaming has never
seen this many players as it does today, okay. So just from an engagement
standpoint, it's a great place to be.
Number two is, I like to say in the old days -- which ends up being like three years
ago. But in the old days, it was us and Sony or Nintendo walking to these content
creators and talking about deals or future content pipeline. And now you're in a
world with Google and Facebook and Amazon and Tencent, Sony, Nintendo,
Microsoft, you're in a world where there's much more demand for content pipeline
and which from a -- I'll say, from a publisher perspective, is great when you think
about the economics that they can drive. And that's on the point about economics
on our side, but it's just ability for us for them to go chase high demand from
platform owners.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 15Brent John Thill
Tim StuartFrom a consumer standpoint, if you're a game creator, games are getting more
expensive to create. They're driving revenue growth as well, and they're looking for
opportunities to go create more monetization for the support of that content
creation. And that's when you see a little bit of the game pricing going up. So your
example is $60 going to $70 on some games. But also, when we think about Game
Pass on our side, it's another outlet for our content creators to go ﬁnd new users, to
ﬁnd a way to monetize those users that may not have played their games.
So the example I give here is for Grand Theft Auto, which has been in Game Pass.
You sell the game for $60. There are users that wouldn't have paid $60 for that
game. But now that it's in Game Pass, they are ﬁnding new users that otherwise
wouldn't have played that game. And these games are excellent at post-sale
monetization, right? They're selling maps and skins and weapons and missions and
things like that. They have the ability to ﬁnd new users. They have an ability to ﬁnd
great monetization models for those new users, and that's driving revenue upside for
them as well. So they're expanding their sort of top of funnel through Game Pass
oﬀerings.
But Brent, to your point, exactly, I think that they're seeing high demand, high
engagement. Content is such a cornerstone of what gaming is, right? We all want to
play the games. And they're ﬁnding unique opportunities to either raise price or ﬁnd
monetization opportunities as well. The kind of the side joke I'll give is, the last time
there was a price increase was, what, seen or eight years ago or something. So time
value of money says, says it's about time anyway. But that's kind of a side point.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
That's great. I guess last question for you, and I'll turn it over to Alex. Just at a high
level, what is, from your perspective, living on the inside, what are the things that you
see and feel that we can't feel? Like what is kind of the most exciting thing from your
perspective that you would bring?
We get to watch a lot of these great companies like yourself, but we really don't get
a sense of what it's like to be at the 12th hole at Augusta, if you will. What's it like?
What are you most excited about? And then I'll turn it to Alex.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. I think the thing that I'm most excited about from a -- I'll say, from a -- from an
Xbox or Microsoft landscape, is our ability to have an oﬀering that can move oﬀ
console to chase new customers. In the past, where we had just a console lens, the
console space, again, you're kind of locked into that console market, if you will.
Game streaming and ability to serve up a AAA-quality game to an Android device, to
a PC without a GPU, to a smart screen is going to be, I think, an unlock for gamers
unlike what we've seen in the past. The ability for a user who wasn't going to buy a
console can now participate in the AAA-console-quality game market I think it's
going to be a really, really unique experience. It's going to create a lot of newFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-12

Tim Stuartgamers, too, that may have been used to playing Candy Crush or something on their
phone. They can now play AAA-quality games on their device with a controller just
bound to it or whatnot.
So I think from the inside, I see usage happening through our game streaming. Just -
- we've only just launched it eﬀectively. But I see users playing more, buying more,
playing on the go. And I think that's going to be an awesome experience that will
unlock a lot for Microsoft and for our Game Pass subscriber base.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Great job, Tim. Good luck with the rest of this. And thanks for your time. I'll turn it to
the better half of the presentation with Alex.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Great.
{BIO 20428248 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks, Brent, and thanks again, Tim, for joining. And to the folks on the line, if
you do have a question for Tim, you could ask it directly through the Zoom portal,
and we'll make sure to get it relayed. But Tim, I want to go back to your comments
on Game Pass, right? You keep expanding the amount of games in the bundle. You
have this partnership with EA Play now. So just curious if you're seeing a larger
opportunity on the subscription side now than you've had in the past and the
processes to lean into that.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes, that's a great question. Game Pass is our North Star strategy. It's the, how do you
get customers in a subscription model? And then how do you have a content
pipeline that supports all the games that they want to play? Now of course, we love
supporting games outside of Game Pass as well. That's still the Xbox business
model.
But we see unique opportunity here. You, probably like me, have ﬁve or six
consumer subscriptions, whether it's Hulu or Netﬂix or Spotify or whatever it is. And
we see that to be a world now where consumers are used to and more than happy to
pay and play in those kind of examples. So unlike the past decade, I think we see a
world where consumers are ready to go down that business model approach. I don't
think we were in a world 10 years ago to really see that. So I think that's number one
uniquely important about the time that we live in.
Number two is the partnership that we have with our partners across the industry,
inclusive of EA Play. I love EA Play coming into Game Pass, and users get it for free.
They get to be able to participate in EA Play as we build out our content pipeline.
And this is going to be a little bit of a bridge to the acquisition that -- with Bethesda.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 15Alexander Joseph Giaimo
Tim StuartBut my point here is, we will need to have a content pipeline that supports future
success state. If Netﬂix, of course, they assume success in Netﬂix, but if they looked
at content pricing or content pipeline today, should or could or would they have
been more acquisitive on the ﬁrst-party side to bring content in sooner from a ﬁrst-
party landscape? But as we see success growing in Game Pass, we're going to need
to have a content pipeline, both through a rent: we partner with partners in the
industry; and through a buy.
We'll need to have ﬁrst-party content that we can launch day and date, not unlike
Orange is the New Black or Stranger Things and House of Cards, boom, boom,
boom. We want to have that from our ﬁrst-party landscape as well. So that's one of
the places that we're being a little bit more active in, as you've seen with Bethesda
and some of the acquisitions we've done over the last couple of years.
{BIO 20428248 <GO>}
Yes. And how do you balance that mix, right? So on the ﬁrst-party publishing side,
you have a lot of fantastic content. Obviously, Halo, everyone is highly anticipating
that launch next year. You've been doing acquisitions. But then you also -- you're also
a distribution platform for the third-party publishers out there. So kind of how do you
balance the mix between priorities and the shift that dynamic?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes, that's a great question and something we balance a lot because as a platform --
and this is Microsoft DNA as well, for us to be successful, our partners have to be
successful. And so we want to be in a world where something like Game Pass can
live alongside stand-alone games or live alongside -- if customers want to buy a $60
or $70 game in that post-sale monetization, that's great. We want our partners to be
successful on the platform.
And so it's something we think about a lot. And our conversations in the industry is,
do you ﬁnd more consumers in a Game Pass-type example? And if so, and you can
monetize those users better through a deal speciﬁcally with us, maybe that's the
right windowing opportunity. You have a $60 or $70 launch, and then you window
into Game Pass to go hit another revenue stream downstream. Or for ﬁrst party, we
want to have ﬁrst-party content be a driver of why people want to subscribe to Game
Pass. And again, if I can get someone into a $9.99 a month or $14.99 a month
subscription and ﬁrst-party content is the reason they did that, I can monetize the
consumer a lot higher. The -- as you say, the economics are better if they're on a
subscription for a long-term as opposed to maybe buying a game once a year or
otherwise.
And that we share that revenue. I'm not making a point about business model here
or our deals. But Game Pass creates a revenue stream from which we can go create a
content pipeline through deals or otherwise through our content creators. But I think
the speciﬁc answer to your question is, we need the Activisions, the Ubisofts, the
EAS, the Take-Twos, the Epics, all the way down to indie creators to be successful on
the platform. So we want Game Pass to be net additive to them. And if they chooseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-12

Tim Stuartnot to be in Game Pass, we want to create a platform that ﬁnds the maximum
number of users that can spend the maximum number of dollars for them. And we
want Activision, EA, Take-Two, Ubi to be highly successful on the platform regardless
of the direction they choose to go.
{BIO 20428248 <GO>}
And even before the Bethesda acquisition, you had been acquiring a handful of
smaller, independent studios. Just curious, are you still looking at more studios?
What do you look for when you approach these teams? And just what's the overall
maybe M&A priority right now?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. I think the short answer to still looking is we will continue to be acquisitive. We'll
continue to look around the industry to ﬁnd who has the great IP, who are great
leaders, who has great product development, who can we rely on and say, we need
a AAA game launching in FY '24 Q1 for Game Pass. Let's line that -- let's line the road
map up to go land that -- plan that perspective. So we'll continue to look at. In the
past, Bethesda was a little bit of a diﬀerent lens to what we've done in the past,
whether it's Ninja Theory or Obsidian or inXile, some of the smaller studios that had
great IP. Bethesda gave us a great sort of launch with -- I'll say, launch into a big, let's
call it, group of content, a big catalog of content that we can use for Game Pass.
And we said this as part of the announcement. When we think about Bethesda, it's
going to be the continuing to allow -- I'll say allow, but continue to sell their games
on the platforms that they exist today, and we'll determine what that looks over time
and will change over time. I'm not making any announcements about exclusivity or
something like that. But that model will change. But really, it's about how do you take
that content and put it into a service like Game Pass to drive that subscription of the
North Star metric? So I think the long -- the short answer to your question is we'll
continue to look at content, we will continue to look at bolstering our ﬁrst-party
studios. And as always, if the right value is there with the right content creators with
the right IP, we'll continue to look at opportunities like that.
{BIO 20428248 <GO>}
That's helpful. And then we touched on this earlier, but with the news that some of
the third-party publishers are going to be raising pricing on their AAA titles, maybe
all titles, does Microsoft follow suit in terms of your ﬁrst-party published content?
How do you think about pricing compared to where it was? I think the last time
prices went up was actually two console refreshes ago. But what are your thoughts
there?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. I think we're not making speciﬁc announcements on ﬁrst-party pricing yet. So
we'll do that sort of in due time. But again, if -- I think if publishers can ﬁnd a price
point that works for their audience, deﬁnes a price point that works for theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-12

Page 9 of 15Q - Alexander Joseph Giaimo
A - Tim Stuartmaximization of, I'll say users and revenue, because you want to drive engagement. I
talk about engagement equals currency a lot. Engagement is the ability for you to
drive wholesale monetization, to drive activation of your content, to drive sort of
hours in your service.
Because these games are becoming, as we all know, they're becoming ecosystems
under their own -- or onto their own. Call of Duty wants to keep a Call of Duty player
and monetize them down the road. FIFA wants to keep a FIFA player in their
ecosystem and monetize down the road. So I think we'll look at publishers to make
the right decision for their content. If they can drive a premium price point or a
higher price point, I think that's warranted. And I'd say, your point is exactly right.
Prices have not gone up in -- what, for a couple of generations now, so it's not
unheard of to see things like this going on.
And to the point earlier, content creation costs go up. And these publishers and
content creators, including ourselves, want to make sure you're driving the right
gross margin proﬁles, the right earnings proﬁles of what it takes to build these new,
awesome, amazing games. And you want to make sure you have a good top line to
support that.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 20428248 <GO>}
Right. And one of the questions we're getting from the audience is, do you think the
future of video games will be 100% cloud gaming? And obviously, you just released
a piece of hardware, so that's certainly been your focus. But is there a time frame or a
speciﬁc amount of years in which you think cloud gaming can really become
mainstream? And maybe what are the limitations right now that's preventing that?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
My joke here is, I think I've said this is the last console generation for 15 years or so,
and it always makes sense from an economics and a technology standpoint to
launch one. I think it's a question we think about a lot. One of the things that we go
through when we're developing a new console is, does the technology makes sense
to launch something new? Does the market demand or want something new? So
you think about the new ones we've launched just this week, raytracing, RDNA, near
instant load times, those kind of things are all ushered in now with the silicon
develop -- the silicon that enables that to happen. So we think that it's the right time
to launch based on the price points and based on the tech now.
I think as you look forward a decade, cloud streaming will become more mainstream.
It will become more about how users play. And this is why I love the connection we
have to Azure. It's our ability to go chase that opportunity, to go chase that market as
users shift from console-ﬁrst to, let's call it, we call it mobile-ﬁrst, but really what I
mean is console-unlocked-ﬁrst. I think that's going to be a more active way that
people play. Now that being said, if there's an opportunity for another console to
have local compute under a TV, and that's the best way to play on your 65-inchFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 15Q - Alexander Joseph Giaimo
A - Tim StuartOLED at 120 frames a second, we will continue to look at that. And if that is still the
right and best way for high-value gamers to play or users that want to play with the
top ﬁdelity, we'll continue to look at that, of course.
But as I look at the next decade, and this is more of a longer term play, I believe it's
going to shift more into a cloud streaming world. When I look at latency now, it's in a
place where it makes games fun, you can play. And I'll make a little bit of a bridge
point back to 5G. 5G rollout here allows, I think, game streaming to hit two things,
one of which is geographic expansion. When you think about going into Africa and
India, Southeast Asia, 5G allows that technology stream from the cloud to really be
exciting and a great user experience.
And number two is latency. You can play games at a far faster clip. You can have
much lower latency with 5G. And partners that we see in the mobile industry, the
mobile operator side, are looking for that diﬀerentiated experience. They're looking
for the things they can upsell to their unlimited data plans or their 5G data plans.
Some of the ﬁrst calls we got, as I mentioned, were from mobile operators in the
world, looking to partner with us on our game streaming tech with Project xCloud to
deliver game streaming over their networks. They need that diﬀerentiation. Much like
YouTube or Netﬂix ushered in kind of 4G and LTE, I think game streaming is going to
usher in that 5G landscape. So I'm kind of bouncing your question a little bit, but I
think the 5G ecosystem is -- presuming success, which I do, is going to usher in a
world where the console market will not be as needed to play the games you want
to play.
{BIO 20428248 <GO>}
That's helpful. And another question we're getting from the line here is with the
acquisition of Bethesda, is the plan to make certain Bethesda franchises, like Fallout
and DOOM, exclusive to Xbox? Or will you still support cross-platform play?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. The goal here is, we're -- I'll say it from a cross-platform perspective. Microsoft is
a platform. We're one of the ﬁrst to really support Minecraft, Roadblock, Fortnite
across platforms. So we highly encourage cross-platform play, simply from this
landscape of, if it's good for the gaming ecosystem, it's good for us, classic rising
tide lifts all boats.
What we'll do in the long run is we don't have intentions of just pulling all of
Bethesda content out of Sony or Nintendo or otherwise. But what we want is we
want that content, in the long run, to be either ﬁrst or better or best or pick your
diﬀerentiated experience, on our platforms. We will want Bethesda content to show
up the best as -- on our platforms. Yes. That's not a point about being exclusive.
That's not a point about we're being -- adjusting timing or content or road map. But
if you think about something like Game Pass, if it shows up best in Game Pass, that's
what we want to see, and we want to drive our Game Pass subscriber base through
that Bethesda pipeline. So again, I'm not announcing pulling content from platforms
one way or the other. But I suspect you'll continue to see us shift towards a ﬁrst or
better or best approach on our platforms.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-12

That helps. And then one question we're getting a lot, and maybe you can just
answer from a high level. But folks are just curious how the economics work behind
some of these partnerships, right? So a company like EA that you guys put on Game
Pass, are they compensated based on usage? Is it sort of a ﬂat fee based on subs.
Maybe just from a high level, if you can touch on that a bit.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. There's a couple of lenses on this question, which are interesting. I'd day the ﬁrst
is as Xbox, we have revenue streams with these companies across the board. So
think about third-party store or advertising or Game Pass, we have ways to monetize
our consumers in broader ways than just doing Game Pass relationships. So the
deals will all be diﬀerent across our partners. Because you could say -- and this isn't
me talking about EA speciﬁcally, come into Game Pass and you'll get a diﬀerent rev
share or something on the digital transaction side. Or come into Game Pass, and
we'll have just a direct payment relationship. Or come into Game Pass, and you'll
have the ability to go acquire new customers that you haven't seen before and drive
post-sale monetization with those customers.
So there's going to be unique diﬀerences between the partner that we're working
with and what they want to see out of the relationship. But we do have a -- Game
Pass does drive a brand-new revenue stream. Our job as a platform is to create a
world where those revenue streams create revenue-sharing opportunities for our
publishers, for our developers and for us. And so while I won't highlight EA or
somebody speciﬁcally, we do have a world where we create revenue streams. As
they're successful, we're successful and vice versa, and we'll continue to go build out
higher revenue proﬁles that we can make sure we participate and share with our
publishing partners.
{BIO 20428248 <GO>}
And you have this ﬁnancing option now for the ﬁrst time, right? So kind of lowering
the upfront cost to acquire one of these consoles. Is there any early observation by
maybe the uptick you're seeing there? Is this going to create a situation in which
maybe the installed base scales more quickly than previous cycles, just given the fact
that it's a bit more aﬀordable?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. I think that's a great question. So when you think about -- what you're talking
about is Xbox All Access. And so for the audience, that is the ability to buy a piece of
hardware plus Xbox Game Pass Ultimate sort of subscription service for a monthly
price. So $24.99 a month in the U.S. for Xbox Series S or $34.99 for Xbox Series X.
And what I love about this is a couple of things. Number one is, it diﬀerentiates
ourselves versus competition. So it's not something that Playstation has in a very
material way. Game Pass gives us the ability to provide a content bundle that can beFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-12

A - Tim Stuartpaid oﬀ over time. And it's not a ﬁnancing deal. It's more of a -- thinking about it like
a hardware subscription. So I love that perspective from a diﬀerentiation lens.
I love the ability for a customer who may not have wanted to spend $500 or $300, or
whatever the price point is, to come in and join Xbox for a low monthly rate. So I
think we're removing the barriers to entry. We're taking some friction out of the
ecosystem there. And lastly is distribution. We're seeing great uptake from
something like Telstra in Australia is a great example. So they're world-class, as many
global operators are, about selling hardware plus service bundles. But clearly, they
do this with mobile phones plus their subscription service, so their data plans. So we
are going into a much broader footprint from a distribution landscape with these
audiences. And so someone that walks into a Telstra or a T-Mobile, a Verizon or
AT&T, they can now buy a sort of hardware plus services plan unlike anything they've
seen before versus that kind of big outlay upfront.
So excitement's there. I think we're seeing some uptake there, which is great. A little
bit of a short-term lens of, if you're someone looking to demand -- or supply is tight
right now, demand is high. So you're going to get a lot of people just click and buy,
buy, buy. But I think in the long run, this Xbox All Access, hardware plus services
bundle is going to be a great opportunity for us to go reach new customers and
continue to diﬀerentiate versus competition in this space.
{BIO 20428248 <GO>}
Another question we're getting is for an update with the strategic partnership you
signed with Sony on the cloud. Maybe just what's the opportunity there?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. I think -- and I won't comment speciﬁcally about Sony, not to get on a-- not to
make the -- not to deﬂect the question. But what I would say is Microsoft as a
platform provider, that's our DNA. If Sony or I'll say Nintendo or EA or I'll pick
anybody, frankly, that doesn't have a ﬁrst-party cloud sees the future of where the
business is going -- and I'll call it cloud streaming. You're going to have to have a
cloud provider that serves up to those customers.
Again, Microsoft invested billions of dollars in this space to have an some awesome
Azure landscape and Azure geo footprint. And if there's something like -- a partner
without that, I think you're going to need a cloud to go reach those audiences.
Especially if you're -- in this example, like Sony, you're a hardware operator, which
doesn't have a cloud and the ability of where the markets -- or where the market is
going, I think you're going to need a cloud provider to do that.
So we, as a cloud provider, would happily take publishers or developers or hardware
ecosystems into the -- into our ecosystem and serve to our customers. Clearly,
Microsoft has heritage in the video game space, so we know what that partnership
looks like. Phil Spencer and Scott Guthrie have a great partnership internally at
Microsoft between the two. And I think it's a good place to be. But we can sell -- sell
our cloud opportunities for partners that may want to look for that opportunity as
well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-12

That's helpful. And we do have about ﬁve minutes left, so I'll try to get to the
remaining questions I'm seeing. But one question is around the relevance of Game
Pass as free to play rises in popularity, right. And obviously, you make money
through free-to-play games in other ways. But just curious, does that impact the
uptick or the take rate, so to speak, that folks are willing to pay on the subscription
side and just the balance between engagement and how that might impact the
subscription model?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
It's a good question. One of the things that's up to us is to make it so Game Pass can
coexist in the world of free to play as well. And I would say, interestingly, free to play
is more of a -- it's a game mechanic as well. Games are designed to be free to play
from the beginning. It's not like, generally speaking, you should take a game that's
been designed for an upfront purchase with PSM and just turn it into free to play.
The games that work the best are designed that way from the beginning.
What I would say though is, interestingly, many players in Fortnite or other free-to-
play games, Rocket League or Roadblocks, et cetera, many of them spend actually
more dollars overall than they would have if they bought the game for $30 or $40 or
$50 just because of the way they play. And I think free to play is an interesting game
mechanic. It's less about playing the game for free. It's just more about how they
increase top of funnel.
So it's up to us as a platform and the owners of Game Pass to create a reason where
maybe we put a free-to-play game in Game Pass. Maybe you get a certain amount of
in-game currency. You get a unique skin or a diﬀerentiated experience by being a
Game Pass subscriber. So I think what you'll see from us is the sort of the
cohesiveness between a free-to-play world and a Game Pass world, where actually, I
want to be a Game Pass subscriber and still play the free-to-play games because I
get something that's unique or I get value or I get some in-game currency or
whatever. So I think that you'll see from us a world where they exist together, and I
think you'll see a net additive place across the platform.
{BIO 20428248 <GO>}
Maybe one last question, but now that the consoles are out, how does your job
change or what priorities changed? Where do you shift your focus over the next
couple of years as you're sort of in the early stages of the console refresh here?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. For us, it's all about growth. It's all about how do you go ﬁnd new customers. I
like to talk about Microsoft-level relevance, and of course, we're relevant today. But
it's the going from what is a console ecosystem to expanding into that billions of
gamers around the world ecosystem. That's the growth opportunity that we see at
Xbox within Microsoft. And so of course, we're going to play to win in console. Of
course, we're going to drive that place. Of course, we're going to make it the bestFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-12

A - Tim Stuartplace to place to play for consumers and the best place to monetize for our
publishers and partners.
But our job as Xbox and gaming at Microsoft is to look for those growth
opportunities. How do you go sell Game Pass to 100 million players? How do you
sell it into India and Africa? How do you sell it to mobile-ﬁrst consumers? That's really
how my job changes. Are we getting a content pipeline that can support that? Are
we getting an Azure footprint that can support that? Are we getting a go-to-market
model, a strategy, price points that can support that.
So I think from us, that's what you should expect is, as we grow to that non-console
audience, how do you go chase that -- those hundreds of millions of new gamers
that we haven't seen in the past. And that's what gets me most excited. That's what
gets me out of bed each morning. That's what I love coming in to work to do is
growing the business and ﬁnding those consumers that we've never seen before.
And how do we partner with players in the industry to go do that. That's Microsoft's
core DNA. That's how we win as a platform. And I think that's really the sort of North
Star that we're chasing.
