Welcome, and thank you for joining us. We are here today to talk about something
that's very fundamental to the human experience, the way we work, and more
speciﬁcally, the way we work with computers. In fact, we've been on this continuous
journey towards human-computer symbiosis for several decades, starting with
Vannevar Bush's vision that he outlined in his seminal 1945 essay "As We May Think."
Bush envisioned a futuristic device called Memex that would collect knowledge,
make it easy for humans to retrieve that knowledge with exceeding speed and
ﬂexibility. It's fascinating to see that someone postulated even back then so vividly
what an intuitive relationship between humans and computing could be. Since then,
there have been several moments that have brought us closer to that vision.
In 1968, Douglas Engelbart's "Mother of All Demos" showed the remarkable
potential of graphical user interface, including things like multiple windows, pointing
and clicking with the mouse, word processing that was full screen, hypertext, video
conferencing, to just name a few.
Later, the team at Xerox PARC made computing personal and practical with Alto that
ushered in the personal computing era. Then, of course, came the web, the browser,
and then the iPhone. Each of these seminal moments has brought us one step closer
to a more symbiotic relationship between humans and computing.
Today, we are at the start of a new era of computing, and another step on this
journey. Over the past few months, powerful new foundation models, together with
accessible natural language interface has ushered in an exciting new face of AI. This
next generation of AI is fundamentally diﬀerent from the AI, in fact, that we've grown
accustomed to around us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-16

Page 2 of 12Jared SpataroFor years, AI has in fact powered online experiences ranging from search, to social
media, working behind the scenes to serve up recommendations for us or about us;
from what we watch to what websites we visit, to what we buy, that version of AI has
become so second nature in our digital lives that we often don't even realize or
recognize it. You could say we've been using AI on autopilot. And now, this next
generation of AI, we're moving from autopilot to Copilot.
We're already starting to see what these new copilots can unlock for software
developers, for business processes like sales, marketing, and customer service, and
for millions of people synthesizing information in powerful new ways through multi-
turn conversational search. As we build this next generation of AI, we've made a
conscious design choice to put human agency, both at a premium and at the center
of the product.
For the ﬁrst time, we have the access to AI that is as empowering as it is powerful. Of
course, with this empowerment comes greater human responsibility. Just as an
individual can be aided by AI, AI can be inﬂuenced positively or negatively by the
person using it. As we move into this new era, all of us who build AI, deploy AI, use
AI, have a collective obligation to do so responsibly. Fundamentally, AI must evolve
in alignment with social, cultural and legal norms in a democratic society. And as we
make progress, both vigorous debate and scrutiny will both continue to be super-
important.
As we look ahead, we believe this next generation of AI will unlock a new wave of
productivity growth, with powerful copilots designed to remove the drudgery from
our daily tasks and jobs, freeing us to rediscover the joy of creation.
Up to now, we've envisioned a future of computing as an extension of human
intellect and human action. Today is the start of the next step in this journey, with
powerful foundation models, and capable copilots accessible via the most universal
interface, natural language. This will radically transform how computers help us think,
plan, and act.
Just as we can't imagine computing today without a keyboard, mouse or multi-
touch, going forward, we won't be able to imagine computing without copilots, and
natural language problems that intuitively help us with continuation, summarization,
chain of thought reasoning, reviewing, modifying, and acting. That's what we are
excited to show you today.
And with that, I'll hand it oﬀ to Jared to share our Copilot for work.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Thank you. As Satya said, we're at the start of a new era of computing. Before we
look ahead, I want to spend a moment reﬂecting on work and what it means to all of
us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-16

Page 3 of 12Sumit ChauhanFrom an early age, we're asked, what do you want to be when you grow up. Our
answer is a reﬂection of what excites us and the value that we seek to bring to the
world. Even at a young age, we know work is meant to be more than just a job.
Nurses are called to care for people, scientists to make a new discovery, artists to
create something brand new, at its best. Work not only feeds our families, it feeds
our souls.
But today, the reality often falls short of that promise. We spend too much time
consumed by the drudgery of work, on tasks that zap our time, creativity, and energy.
We become separated from the soul of our work. At times, the very tools that should
make us productive seem to get in the way. To reconnect to the soul of our work, we
don't just need a better way of doing the same things, we need a whole new way of
working.
And so today, we're embarking on a journey to help every person around the world
rediscover the soul of work. Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot - your copilot for
work. Copilot combines the power of large language models with your data in the
Microsoft Graph and the Microsoft 365 apps to turn your words into the most
powerful productivity tool on the planet. Copilot is integrated into Microsoft 365 in
two ways. First, it works alongside you, embedded in the apps millions of people use
every day: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams and more.
Second, we're introducing an entirely new experience; Business Chat that works
across all of your data and apps, your documents, emails, calendar, chats, meetings,
and contacts, to do things that you've never been able to do before. And Copilot is
built on Microsoft's comprehensive approach to security, compliance, privacy, and
responsible AI. So, you know, it's enterprise-ready.
Using just your own words, you can put Copilot to work, gathering information in
real-time from across your data and apps to unleash creativity, unlock productivity,
and up-level skills. Now, you can be more creative in Word, more analytical in Excel,
more expressive in PowerPoint, and more productive in Outlook, and even more
collaborative in Teams. Let's take a look.
(Audio-Video Presentation)
That's just a glimpse of what Copilot can do. For the next 20 minutes, we're going to
show you how Copilot is a whole new way of working. You'll see a new interaction
model between people and computers. Sometimes, Copilot will get it right. Other
times, it will be usefully wrong, giving you an idea that's not perfect, but still gives
you a head start. But seeing is believing.
Let's go to Sumit to show you how Copilot will unleash creativity and take the
drudgery out of work for everyone.

Page 4 of 12Thank you, Jared. For more than two decades, I've had the privilege to work on our
core productivity apps: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. In fact, my ﬁrst line of
code at the company was in Excel. And I'm so excited to show you how Microsoft
365 Copilot is coming to life in the products millions of people use and rely on every
day.
What if the tools could learn how you work rather than the other way around?
Copilot unlocks all the richness of these apps through natural language. Let's start
with a real-life example, like a high school graduation. My daughter recently
graduated from high school. So this is really top of mind for me. Let's say I want to
throw her an amazing graduation party. To start, I need to send an invitation to family
and friends. So, let's put Copilot to work.
With a few simple prompts, Copilot understands everything it needs to know to
generate a great ﬁrst draft of the invitation. It's even able to pull in details about the
venue from an e-mail I received last week. Now, I have a draft invite that includes the
basic information. I can edit this, I can ask my guests to share funny stories, and give
them a link where they can upload photos.
Now, I think this ﬁrst draft is a little wordy, so let's make it more concise. With that
done, this is my opportunity to create a loving, and let's be honest, a little
embarrassing slide show to celebrate the occasion. I kick things oﬀ with Copilot,
providing a little information to get started. I add some details about my daughter. I
can also change the style, so it creates something fun and festive. And Copilot goes
to work, ﬁnding the right words, and searching my OneDrive for the best photos. In
seconds, Copilot generates a beautiful presentation with memories,
accomplishments, and advice for the future. I can add my own personal touches to it
and Copilot will be at my side.
Now, let's look at this slide. I'm really happy with the design, but Copilot didn't quite
have what it needed. So, I'm going to rework the text. I can then ask Copilot to make
it more concise and add images. Okay, now that looks great.
On this next slide, there's a part that Copilot didn't quite get right. So, I'll rewrite it so
that it sounds a little bit more like me. I also want to use a diﬀerent image here, so I'll
just tell Copilot what I want and Copilot will ﬁnd it. I can add transitions between the
slides, which I always forget, so that when I play the presentation, it looks really
polished. Okay, I like how that turned out.
Now I don't know about you, but PowerPoint animations have never been my strong
suit. I love that I can do this on my own. The average person uses less than 10% of
what PowerPoint can do, Copilot unlocks the other 90%.
Now, onto party planning. I'll start with a few details about the event, and once again,
Copilot goes to work with a simple prompt, it creates pages for everything I need to
think about to plan this party. Let's say, I want to put this plan in a simple to-do list.
Boom. Done.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-16
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 12I'm thinking about what I want to say to my daughter on her big day. Copilot can get
me started on a speech. I'm not sure how long I want it to be, but let's start with
three minutes. I know I want to tell her how proud I am, acknowledge how hard she's
worked, how inspired I am by her volunteer eﬀorts, and what a wonderful leader she
is. Here's a great ﬁrst draft.
Now, here's an important thing about Copilot. At this point, I decide whether to keep
this draft, modify it, or discard it completely. This is a big change in how people
interact with software. Okay, so this looks pretty good, but let's add some of the
funny stories I collected from friends and family. Let's give it a minute. I can make
these stories more playful and add more, but I actually want to make them a bit
shorter.
Let's get to the punch line, right? There. Much better. Now this looks pretty good,
but I really want to add my own personal touch, so I am going to edit it. You can see
that throughout the writing process, I am always in control. Now, I want to quickly
format it to make sure I nail the delivery. And Copilot automatically adjusts the
spacing, making it easier for me to read and add speaker cues to help me improve
my delivery.
Let's shift gears into Business Mode. You saw how Copilot saves me time as a
working mom. But the real power of Copilot is in how it unleashes creativity at work.
Imagine, you're leading a team at a global manufacturing company, and you want to
create a rock-solid customer proposal and you don't have time for writer's block.
Let's see how Copilot can use your customer notes in OneNote as well as another
internal document. Copilot quickly creates a ﬁrst draft.
Now, you probably want this to look like your previous proposals. Copilot can give
you a draft in the format you typically use. It inserts product images and pulls in
relevant visuals from other ﬁles. You can even include a short summary at the top of
the document. And Copilot can make suggestions to strengthen the proposal, like
adding an FAQ, which it will generate for you. Now remember, you're not going to
send this oﬀ to a customer without a thorough review, but Copilot still saved you
tons of time in the process.
It's time to get ready for your customer pitch meeting. Now, everyone has had a
moment when they wish they could turn their proposal into a customer-ready
presentation without having to start from scratch. Well, guess what? Now you can.
Copilot can turn your Word document into a PowerPoint presentation. Now, you
have a professional-looking presentation that you can hone and polish. This is truly
amazing using just your words. Copilot translates Word into PowerPoint and
PowerPoint into Word.
Now, let's add a slide and give Copilot some quick instructions. There it goes, ready
for you to review. Now, this slide is a little bit wordy. Let's ask Copilot to make it more
visual. And check this out. Copilot can even animate the slide. It gives it a
professional design treatment in a single click. But it doesn't stop there, Copilot canFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-16

Page 6 of 12Jared Spataroeven generate speaker notes. I am serious, speaker notes. It's not only a time saver,
it's helping me be a better presenter and close this deal.
Let's jump into Copilot in Excel. Copilot puts all the rich capabilities of Excel at your
ﬁngertips. Say, you need to analyze this quarter's sales results. You start by asking
Copilot to analyze the data and give you three key trends. Within seconds, you've
got what you need. But you want to drill in. You ask Copilot a follow-up question
about one of the trends. Copilot creates a new sheet. This new sheet creates a
sandbox to play in, to better understand what's going on, without modifying the data
in the original sheet.
This is a great example of how Copilot up-levels your skills, showing you how to
break down the problem step by step. You ask Copilot to visualize what contributed
to the decline in sales growth this period. Copilot adds a little color to make the
problem jump oﬀ the page. Now, you want to dig deeper and ask a follow-up
question. Copilot not only answers your question, it creates a simple model of the
scenario. And it even asks you, if you want to learn more about what it did with a
step-by-step breakdown. Finally, you can ask it to create a graph of your projected
model. Copilot turned a sea of data into clear insights and actions.
Let me show you how Copilot can help you tackle your email. We all struggle with
the pull of the inbox. Sometimes it keeps us from focusing on our most important
work, but at the same time, you do have important emails to respond to. Copilot
separates the signal from the noise and gives you hours of time back.
Copilot can help you triage your inbox, highlighting the most important emails to
prioritize. And Copilot also helps you on the go in Outlook mobile. It can summarize
long email threads, you can draft a reply using data from an Excel ﬁle, and Copilot
will generate a reply for you. You can edit it, you can make it more concise. You can
even change the writing style or add more context. Now, all that's left to do is review
the proposed response and hit send. Copilot is a productivity game changer.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Let me take a moment to explain what you just saw. To build Copilot, we didn't just
connect ChatGPT to Microsoft 365. Microsoft 365 Copilot is powered by what we call
the Copilot System, a sophisticated processing and orchestration engine. It
harnesses the power of three foundational technologies, the Microsoft 365 apps -
that's Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams and more; the Microsoft Graph, that's
all your content and context, your emails, ﬁles, meetings, chats and calendar; and a
large language model or LLM, a creative engine capable of parsing and producing
human readable text, all accessible through natural language. It starts with a prompt
from you in an app. Copilot preprocesses the prompt through an approach called
grounding.
Put simply, grounding improves the quality of the prompt. So, you get answers that
are relevant and actionable. One of the most important parts of grounding is making
a call to the Microsoft Graph to retrieve your business content and context. CopilotFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-16
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 12Charles Lamannacombines this user data from the graph with other inputs to improve the prompt. It
then sends that modiﬁed prompt to the LLM.
You may be familiar with what an LLM can do based on your experience with
ChatGPT or Bing Chat. Copilot takes the response from the LLM and post processes
it. This post processing includes additional grounding calls to the Graph, responsible
AI checks, security, compliance and privacy reviews and command generation.
Finally, Copilot sends a response to the user and commands back to the apps.
Copilot iteratively processes and orchestrates these sophisticated services to
produce a result that feels like magic. It's a system that combines the power of large
language models with your data and apps. Think about it. That's tens of thousands of
commands in the Microsoft 365 apps, trillions of signals in the Microsoft Graph, and
billions of parameters in the LLM. For the ﬁrst time in human history, you can
command all of this power using just your own words. It will transform work as we
know it.
We've shown you how the Copilot system uses AI to supercharge personal
productivity. Now, let's see what happens when you bring Copilot to all your
business processes. To do that, let me hand it over to Charles.
Thanks, Jared. Imagine you lead a sales team. Your number one job is to build
customer relationships and close deals. We are distracted by bookkeeping, note
taking and other drudgery. Copilot lightens the load by improving collaboration and
automating tasks in your sales workﬂow. Copilot understands what it means to be a
seller, and it can even help if life gets in the way. Let's check it out.
It looks like you have a dentist appointment that conﬂicts with your weekly business
review. What if you could do both? With Copilot, you can follow a meeting and
catch-up to see what you missed, even if you can't attend. You'll get a notiﬁcation in
Teams when the recap is ready, and you can see the content that was shared,
detailed notes and any action items. You see there was some discussion about your
customer. You can ask Copilot speciﬁc questions to get more context, and it provides
a detailed response. You can ask questions like why a certain decision was made or
what other options were considered, and it provides citations with a snapshot of the
transcript. It's a huge time-saver.
So that was pretty cool. But the real magic of Copilot happens during a live meeting.
Here, you're in a meeting with your team. You can ask Copilot to summarize what's
happened so far. You can see who said what, what points are made. Copilot is really
capturing the spirit of the discussion.
And as the meeting progresses, you can check on where people stand. You can even
ask Copilot what questions are unresolved. It is just incredible to see this happen in
real time. Teams has changed collaboration forever, but it can also be hard to keepFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-16

Page 8 of 12up with all those chats. Copilot can help you stay on top of it all by summarizing
Teams chat, so you know what you missed.
Here, you were asked for an update on the customer and Copilot can help there,
too. You can simply ask Copilot to create a summary of all the customer
conversations. It produces an overview with citations so that you can verify, reﬁne
and post. You just received an invitation to brainstorm in a Loop Workspace. You may
not have heard of Loop. Loop is a multi-player collaboration canvas with Copilot as
an AI peer to your team along with everyone else. Let's try it out.
Here the team is collaborating in real-time on product oﬀers and pricing, adding
notes and action items to keep everyone on track and up-to-date. You can ask
Copilot to pull data from Excel on the top-selling products by category, and within
seconds, it's processing the information. Another member of your team jumps in and
adds a column and anyone can prompt Copilot to build on each other's ideas.
Everything is captured in prompt history. Now, you can close out the action item and
get ready to meet with the customer. And for that, you turn to Viva Sales. Viva Sales
brings all your key sales processes and data to Microsoft 365 and Copilot. It lets you
focus on connecting with your customer and closing the deal. And it works with your
existing CRM like Microsoft Dynamics 365 or Salesforce.
As the sales meeting starts, you quickly use Copilot and Viva Sales to scan CRM data
to get the latest, including an account overview, recent engagements with the
customer and their key areas of focus, all the information you need to have a
productive conversation. When your customer asks how your product compares to
one of your competitors, Copilot gives you a suggestion from your sales materials.
As the meeting ends, Copilot recaps the call to clearly outline next steps. These
meeting details are saved right back to your CRM. Afterwards, you are ready to
follow up on the meeting and send a proposal. With the simple click of a button,
Copilot gets you started. You can make any adjustments and include additional
details before sending. And when the customer accepts your oﬀer, Copilot and Viva
Sales automatically suggests an update to CRM to close the opportunity as won.
At work, we all have unique and sometimes tedious tasks we wish could be
automated. And at Microsoft, we have incredible workﬂow and automation tools, but
they are not always accessible to everyone. Copilot unlocks all of that. Everyone, not
just developers, can now automate the repetitive work with Power Automate. You've
made the pitch, you won the business. Now you need to deliver and be there for
your customer. You want to be notiﬁed whenever there's an urgent support issue for
your accounts, and you want to create a collaborative space for the account team to
solve the issue together. With Copilot and Power Automate, you can automate both
these things in minutes, using your own words.
As you review the suggested ﬂow, it's looking good. With a little more direction,
Copilot can write a summary of the problem, post that summary in the appropriate
Teams channel, and tag the right colleagues to resolve the issue. This now gets
seamlessly added to my workﬂow, getting it just the way I want it. Here you can see

every customer from now on. And you built it in just a few minutes. Through Copilot,
Power Automate is now an essential part of work for everyone, just like Excel,
PowerPoint and Outlook. You can see how Copilot is a gamechanger for business
processes, not just for sellers, but every other line of business, marketing, ﬁnance,
customer service, and more.
Back to you Jared.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
So far, you've seen how the Copilot system harnesses the power of large language
models, the Microsoft Graph and your apps to completely reimagine knowledge
work. You've seen how Copilot works for you when it's embedded in your apps,
Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams and more. Now, I want to show you an
entirely new standalone experience, Business Chat. You can access Business Chat
from Microsoft365.com, Bing or right in Teams. Business Chat works across all your
emails, ﬁles, meetings, chats, documents, calendar and more to turn all your data
into knowledge. It's your knowledge navigator. First up, let's see how it can catch you
up before a client meeting.
Akosua, show us how.
Let's say you're preparing for a client meeting. You stop by asking yourself where are
my notes, and what did we last discuss? What decisions were made? What are the
open action items? Did the team deliver? Tracking down all these details and ﬁles
can feel like a full-time job. Copilot does the sleuthing for you.
So you start by asking Copilot to summarize all your recent customer interactions,
meetings, content you've shared, any issues and deliverables. Copilot works across
your calendar, emails, chats, documents and meetings to ﬁnd all the pertinent
information. Now you've got a concise summary, complete with citations and
sources. You can hover over names, quotes and verify information or even ﬁnd out
more.
Now you know product lead times are likely to come up, so you ask Copilot to
prepare all those details for you. Now it's pulling together information from various
sources, and within seconds, Copilot synthesizes everything you need so you can
feel prepared. Now let's imagine you're working on your business strategy. You
know you need to pull together a bunch of information and it could take you hours
to ﬁnd it all. Copilot brings together everything you need, the numbers, the emails
with the commentary about the numbers, the additional context from Teams chats,
and reasons across all your structured and unstructured data to create connections
and insights in a whole new way. First, you ask Copilot to pull up quarterly
projections and identify related risks. Copilot gives you key data points and ﬂags
potential issues.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-16

Jon FriedmanNow, you ask Copilot to generate a SWOT analysis based on all this information.
Copilot will categorize the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats in a single
view so you can see what to prioritize. You notice one of the items is incorrect, so you
jump right in and change it. Ask Copilot to turn the SWOT analysis into a new slide
for your upcoming executive review. Now it's creating and adding that slide. It gives
you a preview so you can have conﬁdence that the change was made and you can
reﬁne it in PowerPoint.
You've had a busy day and need to update your team on some big developments.
Copilot can ensure critical information keeps ﬂowing. You start by requesting a
summary of two meetings from earlier on in the day. Copilot combs through your
meeting transcripts and generates a draft that updates the team on critical decisions
to keep everyone moving forward. Copilot provides citations to show you where the
information came from. You can hover over them to get even more detail. You spot
some key information that Copilot missed. You think it's important to share that with
the team, so you ask Copilot to go ahead and add it. It scans through the meeting
transcripts and regenerates the response to include all the extra detail. With your
meeting recap ready, it's time to share. You jump to the Teams channel where you
can reﬁne and post. Now that's business at the speed of AI.
Back to you, Jared.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Thanks, Akosua. This new era of computing will usher in a whole new way of working.
But we feel a profound sense of responsibility to get it right, working closely with our
customers. Let me hand it over to Jamie and Jon for more.
Thanks, Jared. So Jon, let's talk a little about the art and science underlying Copilot.
{BIO 15739234 <GO>}
We crafted every detail. We obsessed over every interaction and designed Copilot
as a connected system, and we used it while we were creating it.
I remember it had some really great ideas about how AI can make meetings better.
But large language models are brilliantly creative. They're also fallible. That's why
grounding the LLM in data is so important.
{BIO 15739234 <GO>}
And we not only built grounding into the system, we also built veriﬁcation into the
experience. We added citations and introduced forms of friction to encourage back
and forth collaboration, and included feedback mechanisms so people can let usFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-16

Jared Spataroknow when we get it wrong. Our goal is to give people agency. To help people get
started, Copilot suggests good prompts. If you don't like what it does, there's the Try
Again button. You always have the option to use, adjust, discard or undo. You saw
that in the demos today.
I've studied AI for decades and I feel this huge sense of responsibility with this
powerful new tool. We have responsibility to get it into people's hands and to do so
in the right way. Security compliance, responsible AI, they're not after thoughts, they
are foundational part of the Copilot system. It's one of the reasons that we're starting
with a small number of customers. And when the system gets things wrong or has
biases or is misused, we have mitigations in place. Every Copilot feature has passed
privacy checks, it's been red teamed by experts and is monitored in real time. And
we're tackling the long-term implications and novel risks like jail breaks. We're going
to make mistakes, but when we do, we'll address them quickly.
{BIO 15739234 <GO>}
Great design is born from iteration. It's a pursuit of always striving to make better. As
a designer, Copilot is the most dynamic material I have ever worked with. It has the
power to adapt to you and up-level your work.
And as a scientist, I love how it's expanding our understanding of what people can
do and we can't wait to see what you do with it.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Everyone deserves to ﬁnd meaning and joy in their work. Today, you've seen how
Microsoft 365 Copilot can reconnect us to the soul of our work. Copilot lets you
harness the power of large language models with your data in the Microsoft Graph
and the richness of the Microsoft 365 apps to unleash creativity, unlock productivity
and up-level skills. And we're just getting started. We're deeply committed to
listening, learning and adapting with speed to help create a brighter future of work
for everyone with AI. Thank you.
