Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's brieﬁng on Pay TV 3.0 The Rise of
the App Aggregator. My name is Geetha Ranganathan. I am a Media Analyst for
Bloomberg Intelligence. And today, I am joined by my colleagues Woo Jin Ho,
Senior Technology Analyst for BI as well as Associate Media Analyst, Amine Bensaid.
We are very fortunate to have Michael Greeson, the Co-Founder of TDG Research,
who will be our guest speaker today. Michael is an 18-year veteran of the connected
consumer, pay TV and broadband media spaces and is widely acknowledged as a
thought leader having accurately predicted the pace of broadband diﬀusion, the rise
of streaming video and the ultimate impact of these trends on the TV ecosystem.
Before we get started, a few housekeeping items. Today's presentation will be
recorded and available for playback. You can ask a question by submitting one to
the right of the slide. We will have a Q&A session at the end of the presentation. A
copy of the slides will be distributed after the event. And here is just a quick plug for
BI. BI is Bloomberg's research platform available to all terminal users. We currently
have about 280 research professionals across the globe covering over 135 industries
and 1,800 companies.
Let's get right to it. Cord cutting has rapidly transformed the industry and the
objective of today's presentation is to not only take a quick look at where things
stand, but more importantly and interestingly to see how things are poised to shake
out over the next few years. The term cord cutting gets thrown around a lot. This is
just basically when users let go of their expensive traditional cable or satellite
subscriptions, mostly for a cheaper alternative. And this has cost the US pay TV
universe to go from about 100 million subscribers in 2015 to about 90 million at the
end of last year. So the industry basically lost about 10 million traditional subscribers
over a three-year period.
And so here's a chart that just shows you cord cutting in action. On BI, we track
quarterly metrics, subscriber gains and losses. These are video subscriber gains and
losses by operator. And if you just see that red box there, we had record traditional
subscriber losses in Q1 of this year. So close to almost 1.3 million losses. But along
with this whole trend of cord cutting, while this has been in full force, the industry has
also witnessed the emergence of a new breed of distributors called vMVPDs orFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-07-09
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 2 of 17Michael Greesonvirtual operators who basically aggregate linear TV content and deliver it over the
Internet. And so the vMVPD, the main attraction there is they're priced really cheaply
compared to your traditional subscriptions of typically around $40 or $45 a month
versus the $85, $90 that you shell out for a traditional video subscription.
So here's a quick lay of the land in terms of the virtual services. We've lost about 10
million traditional subscribers, but the industry has managed to regain some of
those subscriptions. So currently, we have about 8 million people on these virtual
services. And while the industry has ramped up subscribers on these vMVPDs pretty
quickly, over the past few years -- over the past few quarters, we've noticed a
somewhat disconcerting trend because there's been a slowdown in momentum in
some of these services. So especially I want to call out Sling TV and DirecTV now.
We've seen some deceleration in subscriber gains there, but at the same time, Hulu
live and YouTube TV have really been seeing some acceleration. So that's it from me
for now. And I'm now going to invite Michael to give us his take on the industry.
Thank you very much, Geetha. Good morning, everyone. Thank you again for joining
us. This part of the presentation is -- we're going to lay out some groundwork here in
terms of how TDG sees the recent past of pay TV, both legacy and virtual and what
the next ﬁve years looks like and why it looks that way.
But to begin, I'd like to introduce a three-tier model in terms of how we see pay TV.
We say that -- we see it in terms of pay TV 1.0 being the legacy operators, the facility-
based operators that own the network, own the CPE. And they -- if you imagine a
simpliﬁed value chain that ranges from content creation to aggregation to
distribution to consumption, the legacy pay TV operator would control the latter
three, but for the most part remains out of the content business. This is not to argue
they don't have ancillary content interests, i.e., Comcast and NBC, but the operator
themselves is not creating their own branded Comcast content to distribute through
the service. They license other networks and studios, bring that -- aggregate that
content, distribute it and they have company owned CPE. And by the way, this is
again on the -- in the end [ph] and this has been the traditional model for some time.
Now, in terms of how we see the future of legacy MVPD subscriptions in the States,
we -- our 2017 forecasts, which are illustrated here, we started with around 95 million.
We used a three-vector approach in forecasting the future and that's not something
we commonly do. We commonly just use a single vector, but there's so much
uncertainty at the moment as to how -- just how deeply the legacy pay TV losses will
be, how deep they will be over the next ﬁve years. But we guided our clients in 2017,
we said to focus on the bottom half of these vectors, where you see the red area
there. And so, we were forecasting a movement from 95 million in 2017 to
somewhere between 73.5 million and 79.7 million by 2023. The 2018 numbers came
in at approximately just under 92 million and so that's right between our worse -- or
our low line and our mid line. So we're tracking at -- currently at the -- in the direction
that we informed our clients we would be.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-07-09
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 3 of 17Now, the question for many is just how signiﬁcant -- after a record setting Q1, how
signiﬁcant will losses continue to be, will they continue at a 3 million to 4 million
subscriber loss per year or will that taper oﬀ sometime in the next ﬁve years. We're
not particularly optimistic about that and we're still advising to prepare for worst
case. And -- just for those of you that are new to TDG or haven't heard of us, we've
been forecasting legacy pay TV since 2006 in our ﬁve-year forecast are usually oﬀ
less than 2 or 3 percentage points. So we have a good team of forecasters here and
we think we have a grip on the future of legacy pay TV.
Now, why is it getting -- why do we predict it's going to continue to get worse before
it gets better, especially in light of several ﬁrms that seem to repeat annually that
next year is going to be diﬀerent? Next year will be the year that legacy pay TV
subscriptions. The losses are tempered and a bottom is found. Well, because when
we track these -- when we track consumer sentiments via our survey -- our diﬀerent
surveys that we use, this is from benchmarking the connect-to-consumer, which
we've been doing for 10 years, we always ask them on a seven-point scale, how likely
they are to cancel or to downgrade their service and we take the top two rankings,
which means moderately likely to cancel or deﬁnitely will cancel and we pool those
together into a top two score. And if you notice the blue bars, you'll see that they
continually moved up and the Q1 research or the research I just did in May indicated
13% top two. That's the highest top two we've seen since we began tracking these
scales. So, at least according to these measurements, the opportunity or the number
of people that are considering cord cutting is on the rise. No, it's not declining. So
we expect these trends to continue.
Now, the second, pay TV 2.0 is virtual MVPD, so we're using that same four-point
value chain, if you will. And to illustrate how the function of these pay TV 2.0
operators diﬀers from that of pay TV 1.0, they aggregate the content, they distribute
the content, but there's no -- it's not over a private managed network, it's over the
public Internet, the open Internet and it's a bring your own device model. One of the
advantages of virtual delivery is that it's TV as an app, so the smart TV or connected
TV, the ancillary devices, streaming boxes, game consoles, et cetera. But there's no
QoS guarantee all the way down to the premise that that is assured. So they basically
take a two of the four elements of the value chain and they're content-agnostic,
they'll license whatever content is needed, just like pay TV 1.0 and they'll also use just
about any device they can get their app on to and so they're platform agnostic.
Now, as Geetha had pointed out, we have seen some really interesting growth in a
couple diﬀerent virtual MVPD operators, our subscription bases are growing quickly
and that includes YouTube TV with over 1 million subs and, of course, Hulu with live
TV most recently reported in May, they have over 2 million paying subs. So, and this
particular chart shows Sling TV, DirecTV now and as Geetha said, they've run into a
wall even experiencing losses late in -- late Q4 and then virtually no growth at all in
Q1 of this year. And it illustrates Hulu with live TV and then others include -- the
others include the litany of operators that were on Geetha's list. And we're
monitoring each and every one of them, but the breakout right now seems to be
Hulu with live TV and that's a very fertile model for a number of reasons. We'll talk
more about that when we get to pay TV 3.0, why this particular model might work.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-07-09
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 4 of 17Geetha RanganathanI did want to make a quick note, and this is something that's not commonly
understood when it comes to calculating pay TV subscriptions. What a lot of people
do generally is they'll take the number of legacy subs and the number of virtual subs
and they'll add the two together and say that's the gross number of pay TV
subscribers. That's actually -- that actually gives you an incomplete picture, it's lower
than that because there is a signiﬁcant overlap in two years of surveys now. Our data
reports anywhere between a 30% and 45% overlap among, what we call, dual
service subscription among vMVPD subscribers. 40% of them also subscribe to a
legacy pay TV service.
So, why would anybody subscribe to both? Well, we ask that question continually so
we get an insight into the motivations. And what we ﬁnd is that it's largely driven by
an uncertainty as to whether the virtual service is going to live up to the standards
that they expect -- that they've been led to expect from their legacy service. Other
options include access during travel, things of that nature, but it's primarily dual
service subscription because of their uncertainty about the reliability of virtual
services. But this overlap continues. We expect that to decline over time as people
become more comfortable with virtual pay TV services, but at the moment, there is
signiﬁcant overlap that's always important to take that into consideration.
As to our forecast for virtual subs, we also start with 2017 as the beginning point and
around [ph] 5 million subscribers at that point. And we advised our clients that
growth here -- that movement here will be toward the upper half of this diagram, the
red area, and we had approximately 8 million subs at the end of 2018. So came in a
little bit above our high forecast, but we are not changing our guidance. We believe
that the recent gains will be tempered going forward, which we do believe that will
fall, we'll have somewhere between about 19 million and 24 million by 2023, most
likely almost split in the middle of that when we get to that year. So we could -- we
think growth will continue here, but that growth is very diﬀerent than, say, a legacy
addition would be. It's a diﬀerent business relationship, there's no contract involved,
it's very easy to churn. And for comparison, the top two numbers for cancellation
proclivities for virtual is about 75% higher among virtual subs than legacy subs. So
they're even more likely to churn than legacy subs are. And that has to be
considered when you're looking at the long-term viability of this model. So I -- this
section was intended just to set the stage in how we see pay TV 1.0, 2.0 and for later
as we progress in the conversation and we'll expand pay TV 3.0 and what that
means.
But in the meantime, I'm going to turn this back over to Geetha and Woo Jin and --
to talk about cord cutting and who's -- the winners and losers in this space. So
(inaudible).
{BIO 15007716 <GO>}
Thanks, Michael. So before we get into how the industry evolves with pay TV 3.0, I
just wanted to quickly touch on how cord cutting has shaped adjacent industries and
some of the winners and losers from the whole cord cutting revolution. So one of the
platforms that has beneﬁted greatly has been Roku. The stock has been
gangbusters, more than tripling since the beginning of the year. Woo Jin Ho coversFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-07-09

Page 5 of 17Woo Jin HoRoku for Bloomberg Intelligence and will now tell us a little bit about how the
company has been able to cash in, while folks have ditched their cable subscriptions.
{BIO 15225630 <GO>}
Great. Thank you, Geetha. And as Geetha said, I am the Lead Analyst of Roku for
Bloomberg Intelligence. For those who are unfamiliar or uninitiated with Roku, the
company is a leader of over-the-top devices led by its Roku Stick. And the company
has competed eﬀectively versus larger peers, such as Amazon, Apple and Google.
Since it was early on in the streaming trend, it was a spin out of Netﬂix in 2008 and
quite frankly it rolled the streaming adoption wave led by Netﬂix's success.
While Roku is known broadly for its players and, well, we acknowledge that it's
important to build out its account base, where Roku really makes their money and
will generate its long-term growth is in its ad driven platforms. Now, as you can see
in the chart, quarterly perform -- or platform revenue has exceeded player revenue
since the ﬁrst quarter of 2018. And the business is on track to deliver over $700
million in platform sales in 2019 and over $1 billion in 2020 based on consensus
expectations. Now, if you look at 2015, that was roughly about $50 million.
So how does Roku make their platform money? There are four main buckets. One,
they license the Roku operating system to the third -- to set-top box and TV
manufacturers, right, like a Vizio and a TCL. They have revenue sharing agreements
from third party as thought providers, such as HBO or Showtime that are sold on
their platform, Number three, branded channel buttons. So on the Roku remote, you
have the Netﬂix button, Hulu button, the DirecTV button. They get some money for
that. And then lastly the biggest bucket or the largest growing bucket is advertising
on their home screen, such as their banner ads, ﬁrst party video ads and third party
video ad revenue sharing agreements.
Now, advertising will be the biggest engine of growth for Roku going forward in our
view and what we've learned from its results is that, one, there's a growing appetite
for free ad driven streaming content. Now, it's -- Roku channel has had a good
reception from its user, it's already a top ﬁve streaming app or channel according to
the company. And while we -- while some may view the Roku channel as the place
where video content goes to die, the content -- the company has actually grown its
content library from a few hundred title at its inception to roughly 10,000. And these
titles are all opportunities for Roku to insert targeted ads and generate sales.
Now, we may be getting to the point where there is subscriber redux, where it's
getting tougher to justify the cost of adding new subscription video on demand
services. Now, according to Deloitte, on average, US dreamers subscribe to roughly
three services. Let's just say simply put a Netﬂix, a Hulu and an HBO. Once we get
beyond three or four services (inaudible) purposes of the cost beneﬁts of streaming
versus traditional pay TV. And -- but at the same time, the amount of content
continues to grow, amount of video content continues to grow and some of these
smaller niche providers may need to come up with a -- come to a strategic decision
to whether it be a subscription based or an ad based revenue model. And our viewFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-07-09
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 6 of 17Geetha Ranganathan
Michael Greesonis that Roku being one of the prevailing streaming platforms, coupled with its
targeted ad insertion technology, it's well positioned to be one of the beneﬁciaries
of the broadening landscape of that base streaming content. So as these -- as a long
tail of subscriber apps continue to grow, they'll have to go somewhere and it'll be
one, two or four of the leading platform providers that we think Roku is going to be a
beneﬁciary for that.
That's it on Roku. And I'm going to pass it over to Geetha.
{BIO 15007716 <GO>}
Thanks, Woo Jin. So while Roku has been a big winner, we have the content owner,
so the big media companies on the ﬂip side who have really kind of borne the brunt
of a decline in subscriptions. So I just wanted to pull up this chart here quickly to
give you a sense of the number of cable subscribers or cable network subscribers by
each of these big media groups. And this is data that is reported by Nielsen.
So the aﬃliate fees that media -- that big media gets paid is directly related to the
number of pay TV subscriptions. And so if you see the chart back in 2018, we track
two columns there. One is just the traditional-only subscriber base and the other one
tracks traditional along with virtual. And so, obviously, there has been a little bit of
cushioning eﬀect provided by the virtual subscribers, but you see a 4% decline in
traditional subscribers. That gets kind of paired to about 1% in 2018. We're actually
seeing a little bit of an acceleration, so the situation is kind of worsening a little bit in
2019 year-to-date. So 5% just traditional-only and only a 2% -- which kind of gets
paired down to a 2% moderation when virtual services are included. So, obviously,
subscribers still falling.
Now, this has kind of been the whole reason, this has been kind of the precipitating
force for not only a wave of mega media mergers, which has included the Disney-
Fox merger, the AT&T-Time Warner and whatnot. It is also responsible for the pivot to
the all important direct-to-consumer and we're going to see a whole ﬂood of new
services coming into the market later this year.
But with that, I'm actually going to pass it back to Michael to talk about pay TV 3.0.
Very good. Picking up on Geetha's last comments there. These -- the decline in
subscribers for each of the major networks, the industry, the pay TV industry in
general. This is trickling down and impacting the bottom lines of the networks that
are licensing content to these services and is a -- and this is, again, a part of the new
reality that these companies are having to adjust to. So as she noted, you're -- this is
precipitating a large number of both vertical and horizontal consolidation. That is to
say, not only are large content companies buying up other large content companies,
they're also buying up those that create the -- create other -- create and distribute
other types of products, so they buy up the technology companies, they buy up the
distributors. They have a presence in CPE. They're looking to take advantage of theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-07-09
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 7 of 17new value chain that's emerging. And to oﬀset these losses, they're bypassing --
they're choosing to add to their arsenal a product that bypasses traditional
gatekeepers. And in lieu [ph] of that oﬀering branded D2C services as was
referenced for what we expect two of the largest players to the rolling services here
in the next six to nine months that being Disney+ and WarnerMedia services.
And key to this and another condition that is setting the stage for this evolution of
the pay TV model is a wave of tribalism that goes with this. When a powerful brand
decides to launch their own D2C service, the ﬁrst thing they're naturally going to do
is hoard their high value content. So Disney, for example, chose in 2017 not to renew
its Netﬂix contract. That was pretty much the ﬁrst drop, if you will, in the bucket and
others were paying close attention to how that played out and what Disney was --
how Disney was going to -- what they were going to do with that high value content
if they weren't going to distribute it through the (inaudible) aggregators.
So they're holding that content to populate their own branded direct-to-consumer
services. And this creates a very diﬀerent choice environment for the consumer,
oﬀers them a new way to access some of their favorite content, but it also
complicates the -- as was pointed out earlier as well, it also complicates the
budgeting (inaudible) video services. It can become complicated very, very quickly
when one gets in, when one has more than three, four, ﬁve diﬀerent services.
So the question is, how does D2C play long-term and how does it impact the pay TV
business model? Well, the reason why Disney and others are choosing to launch
these services is, as indicated on the prior slide, the conditions are right for this, the
timing is right and they were closely -- and folks have been closely watching this
success, the early success of HBO Now, which has approximately 5 million
subscribers and CBS All Access and Showtime, which had combined approximately
5 million subscribers -- pardon me, got 8 million subscribers as reported in 2018. But
they're -- here's the interesting part, and this seems a bit pie in the sky to me, but this
is -- their internal estimates were suggesting 25 million by 2022. That's -- these were
-- this is publicly released information. These are their expectations. That's
astounding because our forecast call for -- in terms of the number of subscribers not
actually the number of subscriptions, but the number of subscribers, to be around
45 million to 50 million by 2023. So if CBS's estimates are correct, they could make
up -- half of subscribers would be using CBS All Access and Showtime.
I ﬁnd that somewhat untenable, but then, again, the rapid growth in these services
has been surprising to most folks. And the Disney+ expectations, you've probably
seen them from multiple ﬁrms, our own -- our only internal research, I will say in a
very clear voice that this is the most -- this service tested more positively than any
hypothetical service we've ever tested in TDG's history. The number of consumers
that are interested in paying $6.99 a month for that particular content combination
was astounding. So they're expecting 60 million to 90 million subscribers by 2024,
two-thirds of those from international viewers. In other words, the domestic subs will
range from 20 million to 60 million by their own numbers by 2024.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-07-09
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 8 of 17Now, that's a lot of gray between 20 million and 60 million. Given the enthusiasm
that we observed in our May survey for this new oﬀering, there's no -- I don't seeing
any reason why Disney can't have as many of 20 million subs by 2021. This -- I think
this service will move very fast. But more and more of the major networks, again,
they're holding their content, pulling back their high value -- eight of the top 10 most
viewed shows on Netﬂix are owned by third party studios or third party networks that
are launching their own D2C services. So don't be surprised to see not only the
oﬃce disappear as NBC gets further along in its D2C eﬀorts, but other important
shows disappear from the menu and which -- it's another story, but we're talking
about Netﬂix's future and how they will deal with the fact that a lot of their high value
third party content will be leading to populate these services.
Now, it's important that when I talk about pay TV 3.0, I want to make sure everyone is
familiar with the technical or legal FCC deﬁnition of what a multi-video program
distributor is, what we call an MVPD. That was originally deﬁned as such, I won't read
the entire deﬁnition for you, but I did want to focus on the last part. It's a program --
it's a distributor that makes available for purchase by subscribers or customers
multiple channels of video programming.
Now, channel was traditionally understood as a signaling path provided by a cable
television system. Now, with the emergence of virtual MVPDs, these conceptions
were broadened to include Internet delivery, which essentially reversed many years
of case law that required an MVPD to control the entire distribution infrastructure
back in network and CPE. As I illustrated in pay TV 1.0 in the previous chart, that's the
end-to-end service that they provided and that has been challenged by the rise of
virtual. And I'm not going to wait around until the FCC decides to update its
deﬁnition of MVPD to suit my purposes.
I think that the technology and the business models are evolving at such a pace that
the FCC will be lagging in this respect and ultimately it becomes -- it's not truly
relevant whether the FCC agrees that what I call pay TV 3.0 is indeed an MVPD.
That's not important to me. What's important to me is that I'm able to advise my
clients what the future looks like and what the future looks like is more like this type
of chart. Pay TV 3.0, I'm talking here about the D2C aggregators, such as Amazon
channels, such as the Roku channels, such as Apple TV, such as the ecosystem that
Hulu is building, which includes a virtual pay TV service, but it also includes
aggregation and curation of D2C apps.
And as you see, I've got all four of the elements of the chain here connected under
this model, but I do want to clarify these red boxes around a couple, so we're clear
on what the concepts mean. D2C aggregator -- or these aggregators don't
necessarily populate the service -- their curated app store, if you will, it doesn't
contain their own proprietary content, for example Prime channels doesn't have any
Amazon channels or content collections in it. That's available to Prime video
subscribers or Prime members, but they can easily dovetail some of that content into
their own type of D2C channel if they wished. They still serve as an aggregator,
there's no doubt about that. In terms of distribution, the -- these aggregators don't
distribute the content in and of themselves, they provide a gateway to interact withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-07-09
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 9 of 17the app. The app and the company that owns the app are in charge of distribution
and guaranteeing a quality experience.
And consumption ultimately, it's still a BYOD model, but interestingly enough, many
of these D2C aggregators have signiﬁcant plays in the CPE realm. Amazon with Fire
TV, Roku with the Roku streaming boxes, et cetera. So they create a virtual integration
here, where you can imagine them creating some of their own content aggregating,
distributing some of their content or certainly facilitating the distribution of content
through a branded portal to an end user and they could own -- in many cases, they
will own the same device -- their own branded device in a consumer household.
So it's a very diﬀerent play on the four key elements of a pay TV operator, little
variances along the way, but to the end user, the result is an integrated service that
acts very much like a pay TV service. And these type of providers, they aggregate a
wide variety of third party apps, they facilitate the purchase of streaming channels.
We'll call these apps and HBO Now is an app, but it's important that we start using
the word channel here because this is branded content from a studio that's -- that
app is virtual -- that is a virtual channel, if you will.
And they do this through a single branded portal and, again, often paired with
branded hardware on top of that. They provide a one-stop-shop for premium
channels, the HBOs of the world and other D2C apps. It's a curated marketplace.
And importantly, they integrate billing, access and content search into that gateway.
So it provides you very much a set-top box type experience. When you pull up the
Amazon channels app, you can surf around your channels, you can add one quickly,
drop one quickly. You can -- what we call toggling, a new phenomenon that we're
observing and we're launching studies on here in the next two months. That they can
switch back and forth between these channels at will all within the same payment
ecosystem.
Amazon has your credit card, so you could quickly add without having to set up new
credentials or quickly cancel without having to worry about -- or without having to
worry about billing relationship with, say, HBO Now, you talk directly to Amazon to
make sure that you're being properly billed and you're getting the access that you
need. So it's a portal that's very similar to a guide on a -- they -- one would argue that
it's even easier to use than a guide on your pay TV system. And it's just a virtual
interface that becomes the entry point for -- what will become the entry point for a
lot of people that are watching streaming TV instead of just traditional live linear TV.
Well, while primarily on -- these are primarily on-demand services, you're seeing an
increasing amount of live content, especially sports come into these portals via
major league services as well as ESPN+, you'll see DASAN [ph] entering into these
app stores as well. So it's a mix of on-demand and live channels and we expect that
you'll see more and more live sports especially coming into the direct-to-consumer
space.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-07-09
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 10 of 17Now, just to give you an idea of the brand power of the folks involved and we've
already touched on Roku a little bit, let's start with Amazon. 55% of adult broadband
users report using Amazon Prime, with 38% watching Prime video and that's where
Prime channels resides. Right now, we see that Amazon is -- Amazon channels as
responsible for somewhere between 30% and 35% of all direct-to-consumer app
purchases. That's how powerful this store is.
Now, we observed something similar in late 2017 when we were doing an early 2018
when we did our initial D2C research the dominance of Amazon channels was
striking. And what it said to us is that there will be others, we said in early 2018,
others will join this model and we particularly pointed to Roku and Apple as
candidates. And this has in fact transpired. Roku recently reported 27 million active
users, up 40% in just 12 months. And importantly, they're also strongly considering
producing originals now. I remember talking with my D2C analyst early last year. And
I said we need to keep our eye on Roku because they're very likely to get into
original content. He dismissed that idea, he said, no, they're going to stay with the
model they've got and not playing originals. Well, earlier this year and late last year
we started hearing rumors about Roku getting into the originals business. So, they're
certainly considering that.
Jump to Apple TV for a moment, that's the reason why we know very little about the
service other than what you see when you go to the store or open up that gateway.
It's very much -- it's modeled very much like Amazon channels and Roku. It's a
curated app store, but Hulu is really interesting. I saved that for last because they
recently reported about 28 million users. And that's up 3 million in ﬁve -- in basically
four months between the end of last year and May 1st. That's astounding. And
they've got over 2 -- they've grown to over 2 million subs in early May for their Hulu
live TV service. What's more -- and they're creating their own curated app store
within the Hulu environment.
What makes this particular model so dangerous as a pay TV player in general not just
the 3.0 player is that they can oﬀer a pay TV 2.0 service that is a virtual pay TV service
in combination with an on-demand service with ads and on-demand service without
ads. And so you have a combination of four diﬀerent elements here. And where
Hulu's job -- Hulu's goal is is to make it easy for the Hulu user to switch between
those diﬀerent services based on their needs. So for example, if I want to watch an
NFL season, I can go over and subscribe to a certain service for a few months, watch
a bunch of NFL games, discontinue that service and then switch over to maybe an
on-demand service. You ﬂip back and forth between apps and services with great
ease. They're trying to create an ecosystem that combines all the pay TV 2.0 entry
point all together, so that a user doesn't have to leave the Hulu ecosystem to
customize their services to their particular needs at a particular time. That's a very
strong model.
Now, for the -- one of the key drivers in our observation about -- prediction about the
rise of pay TV 3.0 is the amount of research we continue to do on this subject, one of
the most fascinating questions we ask is we tested about -- we told consumers
you've got -- imagine out of these 20 channels we've listed below that you canFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-07-09
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 11 of 17choose ﬁve channels to populate a TV service, any ﬁve you want and we included in
that list (inaudible) apps like Netﬂix and premium channels like HBO as well as
families of networks like NBC (inaudible) et cetera and we deﬁne what channels were
involved in that. No big surprise, Netﬂix topped the list as the most popular channel
in this service, Disney ﬁnished second.
But when we asked -- actually asked them -- asked folks about the ﬁve services
they'd like to have in this new service, we follow up with a question on would you
prefer that to have a single operator or a single service that aggregates all of these
and you have a uniﬁed interface, you've got uniﬁed search, uniﬁed billing, all of this
or do you prefer to use the individual apps that are optimized for certain viewers, like
HBO Now has a very speciﬁc app, and I want to have a relationship with HBO. Well,
about 55% of all respondents said that this was universal across all adult broadband
users, 55% of them said they prefer a single app that aggregates all of these
networks together and provides a single interface and search. Now, 22% had no
preference, but only 22% said they preferred separate apps.
So the future of pay TV looks a little bit like the past pay TV in that the aggregate --
the role of the aggregator is not going to disappear. In fact, as was mentioned
earlier, you get to a certain point where there's diminishing returns in having four or
ﬁve separate apps. Not only is it too expensive, but it's diﬃcult to navigate, it's
diﬃcult to search across all of those to ﬁnd the types of content that you want. So
even though we're splintering up into these individual D2C apps, we expect these
aggregators to begin to oﬀer what we're going to call a bundle of packages, a
bundle of individual apps. So, for example, they might tier the three tiers of services,
they might say for X a $30 a month, let's say for the sake of argument, you can get
one premium app that would be from a premium channel listing HBO, Showtime,
Cinemax, et cetera or -- and then you could also get three mid tier channels and
then you could get ﬁve low tier channels and you bundle those together and give
them a discount for multi-app purchases.
Now, if that happens, that's going to take out the cost factor in having -- the cost
element in considerations of whether I have too many apps or not. The ﬁrst notion is,
well, yes, I have too many apps because I'm paying too much. I might as well get a
pay TV service. Well, if that can be addressed by sort of bundling and these would
be real skinny bundles, not the make-believe skinny bundles that were advanced
through virtual providers and ultimately the costs have increased to such an extent
that they're not much less expensive than full on legacy oﬀerings. These type of
oﬀerings could be legitimate skinny bundles, where you have -- you may only have
eight to 10 channels on it, but they're exactly the channels that you want. You can buy
them individually or in bundles. The bundles make a lot more sense when you start
talking about more than four or ﬁve diﬀerent apps.
So this was very striking research that we've done on this subject and it led us to
believe that there is a model here and we believe that especially Amazon and Roku,
they are looking closely at this model right now, how to aggregate these apps and
present a form of a paid -- form of a pay TV bundle to their multi-app subscribers. So
the future is virtual -- the future is streaming, the future is TV as an app, but the futureFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-07-09

A - Michael Greesonof the aggregator in this new universe, this new pay TV 3.0 universe, is quite solid
and we believe that these large -- a lot of these large tech media companies will be
the ones to provide these gateways and this -- and introduce this new model.
So that's all I have for right now, so I'll turn it back over to Geetha.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 15007716 <GO>}
Thank you so much, Michael. That was absolutely fascinating. So that concludes the
prepared remarks section and we will now switch to Q&A. So just give us a moment
here. Okay. So our ﬁrst question for you Michael, what do you think of cable network
aﬃliate fees? Via aggregation, do you see them going up or down in the coming
years?
That's a good question. I think they'll continue to go up and it's because there's so
much pressure on the model right now to generate revenue and the margins are
razor thin. So they'll look for these -- look for additional fees as a way to make up for
some of that revenue. What do you think, Geetha?
{BIO 15007716 <GO>}
We've actually seen -- I mean, gone are the days when we had 9%, 10% increases in
aﬃliate fees. We've kind of seen them now settle at more like low to mid single-
digits. Obviously, the vMVPDs like what you just mentioned Michael have kind of
helped them stabilize quite a bit. But I think as more and more content owners go
D2C, I'm not sure that they are going to go up substantially, I think. The best that --
the best case scenario for the content owners, for the big media companies is that
they're going to try and maintain probably like low single-digit growth probably, but
it's going to be really interesting, especially with the whole D2C revolution.
I agree. And there's -- again, there's other competitive pressures on them not to rise
-- not to increase that rate too quickly for fear of just spurring more -- just
encouraging -- fueling the D2C ﬁre. But I certainly don't see them not growing. Low
single-digit increases makes sense, given the context.
{BIO 15007716 <GO>}
Next question. Using an analogy from Internet usage, do you view these video
aggregators like a portal i.e., Netscape or a search engine i.e., Google?
Both, both. They'll integrate search and discovery and recommendations across
multiple apps. Now, this is when they're more mature. Of course, we don't have anyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-07-09
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 13 of 17A - Geetha Ranganathan
A - Michael Greeson
A - Woo Jin Hoof these oﬀerings on the plate right down. This is looking toward the meta, looking
in the next several years how things are likely to evolve. Once they get to that point
and oﬀer such a service, one of the key beneﬁts of it is the integration of search,
discovery and recommendations across all of one's apps. So I think that they will
incorporate search and serve as a portal gateway. It's not an either or. I think it's
both.
{BIO 15007716 <GO>}
Next question. If software is a solution for the bundle, doesn't it just become like a
browser, a commodity product?
That's a very, very interesting point. Yes, but to the extent that its IP that's owned by
the individual company, Roku owns its own IP and will design its interface as it sees
ﬁt. And Amazon will do the same when they get to that point as well. So each will still
have their own -- develop their own interfaces for their own service and it won't be --
you could say that the -- you could argue it would be commoditized, but there won't
be that many players that are doing this. So -- it doesn't mean there's going to be a
million similar products out there or thousands of similar products out there, it will
be that these aggregators have interfaces that operate similarly or may even look
similar. To that if you want to infer from that that's somehow commoditized. I -- yeah,
it's a tough word to use in that context. They will all have similar features and
functionality, but there's no doubt that each gateway will try to outdo their
competitors with the features of that gateway, the ease of use, the diﬀerent options
available to it, the power of their search engines, the power of their
recommendation engines, et cetera. So it's commoditized -- it has the potential to
become commoditized only to the extent that they share common feature sets but
within the individual gateways I can imagine these companies [ph] a small fortune to
make sure that that gateway, that interface, that portal if you will is optimized so they
have a value add or a diﬀerentiation point from other competitors.
{BIO 15225630 <GO>}
And this is Woo Jin Ho. And just to chime in here. It all depends on the form factor of
consumption. And if we just think about mobility for instance, it could potentially be
commoditized or browser-based, Roku can be accessed via web browser. But if you
look at the -- where a lot of the consumption is coming from, we're still seeing a fair
amount of consumption coming through TVs, either via through the Roku Stick or the
Amazon Fire Stick or the Apple TV Stick. You just can't carry around your TV along
with you and they're only one of four platforms that you can use in the United States,
and its Amazon, Roku, Apple or -- and even Android TV. So if you win (technical
diﬃculty) one of those four platforms on a TV or a set-top box, you could potentially
win it on the smaller form factor side as well. So is it a commodity product by
deﬁnition? Potentially yes. By the level of deployment right now, no. And the other
thing, I think Michael pointed out very elegantly, is that there's a lot bigger
underlying technology that's helping -- assisting the aggregation here. It's not only,
number one, the aggregation of the diﬀerent content, but also the billing. So there's
a lot of back-end integration that needs to be done by these providers, but I don't
know if a -- another third party may be willing to do. Google has the wherewithal toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-07-09

A - Michael Greesondo that, Amazon has the wherewithal to do that, Apple has the wherewithal to do
that and little Roku has a lot of technology, this -- focus on this one bit of TV
aggregation and billing available to them. So, I'm hesitant to say that it's going to
become commoditized at least in the intermediate-term.
{BIO 15007716 <GO>}
Okay. Next question. If Amazon [ph] is going to be able to make billions of dollars on
advertising, their own content and IMDB, doesn't that put them in conﬂict with other
services? I think we lost Michael here. But here's another question on Comcast.
Comcast explicitly says, it's aiming to position its Xﬁnity service as a program
aggregator similar to Amazon or Roku. What do you see as Comcast opportunities,
challenges here?
Yeah. This is a really interesting question. So Comcast just recently introduced a
product called Flex, where it is charging about $5 a month and working as an app
aggregator. I think what they're really trying to do there is kind of -- they've already
made their shift, their pivot to connectivity. And so that's really where their thrust is.
And so I think that the Flex is really a clever way to get people back into the
ecosystem. I think ultimately what Comcast is realizing is obviously the main product
focus for them over the next few years is going to be broadband and to try and to
get more people to stream and take higher tiers, basically consume more data and
have higher price tiers. So I think that's deﬁnitely a big opportunity for them. Of
course, the bigger challenge for them obviously is are they precipitating cord cutting
and they're obviously trying to be very careful not to do that. It's going to be
interesting to see what happens when they launch their NBC service in 2020 and
how -- again, they have to tread very, very carefully because they are exposed on
both sides here. But I think as of right now, it looks like they have a pretty good
strategy.
So Michael, we have a few more questions here. There was one question on Amazon.
If Amazon is going to be able to make billions of dollars on advertising their own
content, does that put them in conﬂict with other services?
That's -- what's that old expression, the fox guarding the hen house. Yes. Everybody
is in competition with everybody because of the level of consolidation that's going
on. Sure, of course. Of course, they'll be in competition. There's an inherent tension
there again when you -- vertical and horizontal consolidation, you're bound to
compete with yesterday's partners or today's partners or tomorrow's competitors. So
absolutely.
{BIO 15007716 <GO>}
Okay. So I know you spoke a little bit about sports and zone [ph]. A question here on
regional sports networks. What is your view on regional sports networks? Where will
they ﬁt in in the pay TV 3.0 ecosystem?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-07-09
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 15 of 17A - Woo Jin Ho
A - Michael GreesonJust as an app, I would assume, just as their own D2C app just like many of the RSNs
or many of the set of college leagues, et cetera, I would include in this conversation.
They have their own linear channels, so they have their own apps. So if they have a
premium fee-based app, then they -- those -- they would be included as an option.
Now, I am sure for any given sports, there's limitations on the -- on how -- who owns
what rights and to -- how are those rights windowed or limited. That will be certainly
an inherent issue in how -- what role they play, but I think that to the extent if the
leagues continue to grow their D2C traﬃc like they're doing now, there's no reason
why the regional sport networks can also be involved. Again, I'm acknowledging that
the negotiations to get those rights, to introduce such a service may be problematic.
That's not my area of expertise. But there's no reason -- there's no prima facie reason
why you couldn't -- why you shouldn't think that developing apps and including such
apps in these types of portals and these types of curated aggregator stores. No
reason to think that they wouldn't be included in it. Now, I think there's a play, then
the question will be, whether or not they can generate suﬃcient revenue from these
types of relationships.
{BIO 15225630 <GO>}
Michael I have a question. So you were talking about the content creators and then
as we move to the D2C, the platform vendors are going to be beneﬁciaries. I know
we focus on like the top 10 plus sports content creators, like -- and content
aggregrators, let's just say, Netﬂix, HBO and Disney. But what about the hundreds of
other smaller content creators on a subscription basis? I mean, there's got to be so
much room for content acquisition by consumers. I mean, what did those guys do?
Do they stay in a subscription based model or do you think they'll have to cut -- look
at themselves in the mirror and say maybe we have to switch to an ad based model?
How do you think that will play out over the long-term?
I think that's a great question. I think it really depends on the brand of the network,
the channel we're talking about. We did a really interesting report, it was probably a
decade ago. We wrote this report on small channels in the age of streaming. This is
far ahead of the curve. The author was Colin Dixon, who many of you on the call will
know. He was lead analyst for TDG back then. And he analyzed AMC Networks going
D2C and US -- let's see, it was US -- or USA Network and then the Outdoor Channel.
And the conclusions of that exercise was that this -- if it's a strong niche like the
Outdoor Channel is, they might do quite -- they may do really well there. But not, if
they're competing with oﬀering to a -- it won't bring in enough revenue relative to
what they could have brought in if they were part of a pay TV package. A large
network like USA, their reach is substantial and their power is substantial. They could
do a D2C oﬀering and probably do pretty well with it.
So if you got scale, you could do well. Or if you're smaller and you've got a really
legitimate niche, where your linear viewers who are truly dedicated to your content
and that's part of their lifestyle like an Outdoor Channel would be for maybe a
hunter or a ﬁsher -- ﬁsherman, then you might stand a chance on a fee based
subscription level. But I would argue that the ﬁrst play would -- for a small channel
would probably be to go fee based through one of these portals and then wait
before you do a free ad based service.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-07-09
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 16 of 17A - Geetha RanganathanI see free ad based services as -- I know they're -- all the rage right now and that's
largely driven by the success of SVAD or AVAD [ph] aggregators, like Pluto TV and
XUMO and Tubi. They're the ones that are pulling in millions and millions of users,
but the individual -- let me back up. I want to take -- let's take fuboTV as an example.
For them, they've not been able to grow their subscriber base very quickly and that's
disappointing because they've got a really solid oﬀering, especially if you like sports,
but they just launched a free ad based streaming service and they're creating their
own content. So this is another example of someone -- of traditionally a model that
didn't create their own content. The pay TV operators, you've got them creating their
own content. But they've launched that service. And I -- to me, it was -- when I heard
they were going to launch (inaudible) that tells me just how poorly they are doing on
their paid subscriptions. It was a last resort oﬀering and they're spinning it as a
marketing that will help (inaudible) some of their content not necessarily their best
content on there. But if they give it away for free, we ultimately will grow our
subscriber base. It's not an end in itself, it's a means to an end of growing
subscribers. And I think that that dual approach, let's move away from a pay TV
operator to an individual channel, I think that dual approach could be helpful. And I
think you're going to see a lot of people starting with fee based, adding ad based or
even fewer will do the reverse of it. If you do ad based and you're not doing very
well, it's silly to add a fee based. I mean, you've proven to yourself you're not going
to have the market for it. But we -- I see a dual approach there. I see individual app,
much like Hulu does. You can pay X for ad free, you pay Y to put up with some ads. I
think that dual approach is likely for smaller channels. But I think it's critical that play -
- if they're going to play in the D2C game that they've got to get into these portals,
as I mentioned earlier the -- that imaginary model or that ﬁctional model I made, you
buy one premium service, three mid tier services and ﬁve low tier services, they want
to make sure their brand is in that one of those tiers. So that when a hunter goes on
to, I can optimize my package here, I better ﬁnd Outdoor Channel on it because
that's what I watch on regular TV. And if I can't get it on there, the value of the service
is signiﬁcantly diminished because that niche is not ﬁlled for me. And this is
supposed to be a customizable TV service, in theory. Just big brush strokes here.
Yeah. So that --
