Inﬂation in gasoline prices had a slight positive impact on comparable sales for both

Foreign currencies had a negative impact on the four weeks. But a positive impact
on the 26-week period.

weeks, plus 5%. Total Company, four weeks, plus 6%; 26 weeks, plus 5%.

Page 3 of 4Fresh Foods experienced positive comp results in the high single-digit range for the
month. Produce and service deli experienced the strongest results. Fresh Foods also
had slightly inﬂation for the month.
Within ancillary departments, hearing aids, gasoline. And food court showed the
best sales results.
For gasoline, the average selling price per gallon was $3.71 this year, compared to
$3.65 last year. Overall, gasoline price inﬂation had a slight positive impact, about
plus 0.25%, on February comp sales. Comp gallons were up year over year.
Weakening foreign currencies year over year relative to the US dollar resulted in a
detriment to our reported February comp sales of a little more than minus 0.5%.
Total International comps for the four-week period came in at plus 7% local currency.
But resulted in a reported comp of plus 4% when converted to the US dollar.
The average transaction increase year over year in February was a little better than
plus 1%, which includes the negative impact from foreign exchange and the positive
impact from gasoline.
Comparable traﬃc frequency was up approximately 4.5%.
Cannibalization for the month of February had a negative impact to the total
Company comparable sales of a little over minus 0.5%. Much of the cannibalization
is stemming from recent the openings in Asia.
Looking forward, March sales will include 34 selling days for both years, Easter in
both years. The reporting period will end on Sunday, April 7. And will be compared
to the ﬁve weeks ended Sunday, April 8, last year. We plan to announce March sales
