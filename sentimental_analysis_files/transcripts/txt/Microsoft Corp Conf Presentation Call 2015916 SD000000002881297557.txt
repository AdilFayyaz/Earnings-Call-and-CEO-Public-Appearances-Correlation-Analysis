Okay, everybody, why don't we start. We are very happy to have a hot cloud
company in Seattle join us for this slot. I've been instructed to read the safe harbor
Statement before we start. So before we begin, Microsoft may make some forward-
looking statements during this presentation and you should refer to their SEC ﬁlings
for the risk factors relating to their business. And that's true whether you're here in
person or listening in on the web. So check.
Mike Schutz is kind enough to have ﬂown down to join us for this DB event. Mike,
maybe you could talk a little bit about your role but, in terms of title, General
Manager of Cloud Platform Marketing, which you know is part of Microsoft's broader
cloud and enterprise unit. But maybe it's worth starting with a little more of a
description than that so everything is in context.
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
Absolutely. Thank you for having me, Karl. And hi, everybody.
So again, my name is Mike Schutz. I'm the General Manager of Cloud Platform
Product Marketing. My responsibilities include our cloud platform capabilities. That
would include private cloud capabilities like Windows Server, System Center; the
public cloud with Microsoft Azure of which I expect to talk a lot about today. Then
our enterprise mobility capabilities would also fall within that umbrella of the
Microsoft cloud platform. So a few of the products within our new cloud and
enterprise division. And so really pleased to be here today.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Got it. So that's an important point just to start oﬀ with, that when people think
Microsoft cloud they generally think Azure, or maybe broadly deﬁned include Oﬃce
365. But the deﬁnition you just provided of cloud platform extends well beyond that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16

Mike Schutz{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
That's right. So if we start at the top level we think about the Microsoft cloud as the
Microsoft commercial cloud. You think about Oﬃce 365, Dynamic CRM and Azure
and the capabilities within it. So if we double click within the cloud platform
capabilities we really want to focus on, there's some 40-odd services within Microsoft
Azure. Those roughly fall into categories like Infrastructure-as-a-Service. And from a
hybrid cloud perspective, as well as just raw storage and compute. In the cloud
platform capabilities, Platform-as-a-Service. So as organizations think about
modernizing their applications. ISVs think about building cloud native applications
into SaaS apps.
There's a lot of platform capabilities that we oﬀer in Azure. Data platform
capabilities. You think about extending the value of applications and really taking
advantage of big data analytics, Hadoop, structured and unstructured data, machine
learning extending into advanced analytics and into IoT. Then lastly enterprise
mobility. And so in the increasingly mobile world how do we help organizations get
a handle on the security and manageability of a mobile productive workforce,
providing a companion service to Oﬃce 365 to help organizations secure the
devices, secure applications and ultimately the data. So that's kind of the breadth of
the cloud assets.
Then we also think about oﬀering consistent private cloud capabilities so
organizations can build private clouds and hybrid clouds using the technologies that
were cut from same cloth as the public cloud and put them in their data center.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
And Mike, when you think about across all of these cloud assets and you think about
recent demand trends, what are some of the things that you've picked up on that
feel like their inﬂection point changes in the last -- you pick it, six months; whether
it's the kind of workloads that Microsoft's customers have been moving; whether it's
verticals that have really inﬂected in terms of a migration to the cloud? What are
some of the demand trends worth calling out to the group here?
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
Sure, absolutely. So the ﬁrst thing, the biggest change that's happened over the last
12 to 18 months has been the conversation has shifted from why cloud to how should
I move to the cloud or how should I embrace it. And diﬀerent verticals have diﬀerent
challenges with respect to regulatory compliance, data sovereignty, geographic
distribution, etc. But by and large we're seeing a tremendous appetite for decision
makers, NIT decision makers in the line of businesses to look at the cloud, whether it
be SaaS apps, whether that be just thinking about modernizing our infrastructure.
Infrastructure-as-a-Service has proven to be the lowest friction way to start in the
cloud. So if you think about starting in Dev tests [ph], bringing in applications just to
try it out and then bringing those applications back on prem as a starting point.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 14Karl Keirstead
Mike SchutzThing about those line of business applications in Infrastructure-as-a-Service. And
the beneﬁt of Infrastructure-as-a-Service has always been you kind of can take an
existing app without modiﬁcation and run it in the cloud even though it wasn't
designed to be in the cloud. And so a lot of customers have taken that step, at least
for a part of their application estate. And it's less about moving the app and more
about how do I think about extending my data center or extending my IT assets into
the cloud.
And so in terms of the demand signals that we're seeing, one, just huge, explosive
growth in Infrastructure-as-a-Service. But as organizations get more comfortable with
the cloud and they understand the beneﬁts of not just some cost savings but
ultimately the agility in which they're able to provide to the organization, to be able
to do things faster instead of waiting weeks or months to get a server deployed or
an infrastructure or new app deployed, I can do that on demand. Moving into
higher-level services like Platform-as-a-Service or getting more analytics capabilities.
So we're seeing a lot of increased usage in some of these higher-level services as
one example.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Got it. And maybe as we dive into these diﬀerent components of Microsoft's cloud
platform-- and you mentioned at the beginning that this is likely, we'll talk Azure in
this part if that's all right. That's the hot topic. Obviously Microsoft doesn't disclose
Azure revenues. But talked to you on the call gave us some usage metrics which
suggests its growing at a pretty good clip. But obviously AWS is a giant and its
multiple is larger than Azure, whatever the Azure number is. You've got competitors
like Google. You've got IBM with SoftLayer. So it's hyperscale but it's also
hypercompetitive. And so I think everyone would love to hear what are the two or
three main ways that you're trying to diﬀerentiate in the infrastructure space? And in
particular, just because AWS is so big, how are you diﬀerentiating against AWS?
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
Sure, absolutely. And it's a great question. We often have the dialogue with our
customers because many customers have tried or used AWS and so it's absolutely a
dialogue that we have frequently.
You talked about hyperscale. That fundamentally is one of the ways that we
diﬀerentiate. There's only a couple or three hyperscale clouds out there in the world,
us being one of them. We operate today in about 19 regions, which means we have
19 data center regions globally. We continue to expand as our customers need us to
do so. To put it into perspective, that's about twice as many as AWS and about ﬁve or
six times that of Google Cloud platform. And so even if you combined AWS and
Google Cloud, we're in more regions than the two of them combined. And so
hyperscale is important. It's important to our customers because they want our
service where they are and where their customers are. And so that's one of
fundamental tenets. But AWS is big, too.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 14Karl Keirstead
Mike SchutzThe other elements. And this is where really the diﬀerentiation comes in, is around
hybrid. Because of our fundamental strategy to help customers deploy the same
technologies that we put in our public cloud hyperscale data center and run those in
their data center on top of Hyper-V, on top of our System Center assets, as well as
bringing Azure Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service capabilities to
run in their data centers, they then have the ﬂexibility to help decide which
applications move and when.
We also have a set of capabilities that provide connective tissue between the private
cloud and the public cloud, whether or not customers are running our private cloud
technologies or not. Examples there, we have a storage product called StorSimple
that is a -- think of it like a set-top box for storage in their environment. It's an iSCSI
storage device that plugs into an existing environment on premises and it just looks
like a storage area network and it seamlessly tiers the storage to the cloud. And so
customers can think about their data center as seamlessly extending to ours. And
that's a fundamental diﬀerentiation to our approach with respect to the other
hyperscale cloud vendors, is it's not public cloud or bust. We want to meet
customers where they are. And so that's the hybrid element. Very core to our
strategy and, frankly, quite important to our customers because they have existing
assets that they invest on our premises and how can they extend those and yet still
fully embrace the public cloud.
The other element is around our enterprise routes and enterprise-grade support.
And so we have some 650,000 partners worldwide. So we have a very broad
footprint into our existing customer base with our trusted partners. And we also
focus very hard on security and privacy and compliance. We were the ﬁrst public
cloud provider globally to support the ISO 27018 standard which has the highest
standards of privacy today. And it's very important to our international customers as
well as our customers here in North America. And so the enterprise credibility
element of our DNA and helping customers in the enterprise is very core to our
strategy.
So those are at a highest level kind of why Microsoft.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
From a capability perspective we're also diﬀerentiated in the level of services that we
have relative to the competitors. Infrastructure-as-a-Service, as I said, there's lots of
players there. Microsoft and AWS are both leaders from a Gartner Magic Quadrant
perspective in Infrastructure-as-a-Service. But AWS is not a leader in the public cloud
PaaS platform and Microsoft is. As well as Storage-as-a-Service where Amazon also
plays. And so think about the breadth of the Microsoft oﬀering. It helps align with
where our customers are looking to move over time as they think about application
modernization and not just running VMs in the cloud, as well as our broad footprint
and our trust that we have in the enterprise community.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16

Mike Schutz{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes. And actually on that question, I know Microsoft hasn't disclosed this so Zack is
probably going to shake his head at you when I ask this question. But can you talk a
little bit about this diﬀerentiation between running VMs in the cloud? Pure compute
service storage infrastructure versus the premium services on top? Any metrics you
can share? Maybe anecdotes just around what that mix is for Azure and how it's
changing?
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
Well let me tell you what we're seeing is -- outside of a speciﬁc metric. But certainly
Infrastructure-as-a-Service is an onramp to the cloud. But Azure App Service, which is
a PaaS platform on Azure, is a very fast-growing service for us as are some of our
data platform services. And so we see the entry point that customers start will
oftentimes be Infrastructure-as-a-Service and then they combine Infrastructure-as-a-
Service plus next-gen app platform as part as they go out. And so the move that we
see are the addition of premium services we will continue to see growth in.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Okay. And if could ask you a question about one of the -- I think I get the opportunity
to leverage Microsoft's incredible software portfolio. But that's really a little bit of a
double-edge sword, because if you get perceived by potential clients that Azure is a
little bit too Microsoft-centric it can be a bad thing because you've got AWS pitching
a sort of Swiss neutrality. So how do you get beyond that issue because you don't
really have a (inaudible) here in Azure. You don't yet, as far as I know, have full Red
Hat Enterprise limited support on Azure. So I think everyone would love Microsoft to
open up to more third-party technology as part of Azure. Where are you on that
journey?
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
It's absolutely been a huge focus and I hope that everybody is seeing the progress
that we've made there. In fact, today about 20%, over 20% of the virtual machines in
Azure Infrastructure-as-a-Service are running Linux. And so we think about openness
very broadly. Our platform used to be the Windows platform and Azure is now the
platform that we focus on for any application. And that could be Windows, it could
be Linux. And so whether it be at the operating system layer with Windows and
Linux, whether it's at the data layer. So you think about we've got Oracle supported
on Azure, SAP, IBM DB2. But also Hadoop, Cloudera, DataStax. So a lot of the most
popular data layer capabilities, outside of SQL server, of course, which we believe is
great. But whatever a customer wants to do at their data layer we want to support
that.
At the -- from a mobile device standpoint we have great solutions to help customers
build mobile apps and connect those mobile apps to Android, iOS devices, as well
as of course Windows devices. From a language perspective we believe .NET isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16

Mike Schutzgreat. But at the same time, we want to make sure that developers are familiar with
and would like to use Java, Node.js, PHP, Ruby. Whatever they like to choose we
want to have those be available on Microsoft Azure. And so we've made a lot of
progress to support any app, any OS on Microsoft Azure and we'll continue to make
announcements as we go on that.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
And do you think, Mike, there's an opportunity to enhance the relationship, the
partnership with Red Hat to provide RHEL support on Azure?
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
We continue to make progress and work on that. So we're excited about what the
future might bring.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Okay, good. You mentioned just a minute ago ﬂipping a little bit to the enterprise
mobility side. That's an area that we're hearing from Microsoft more and more. It
seems to be one of your more popular, quote, premium services in your cloud
platform.
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Can you talk a little bit about that? It sounds like you're putting up amazing growth
but a lot of people in this room are aware that AirWatch has -- owned by VMware
and it's doing extremely well. MobileIron is there. Obviously it's a competitive space.
Blackberry just bought Good. So how do you diﬀerentiate yourself on that front?
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
Well from an enterprise mobility perspective you're absolutely correct. We're very
pleased with the growth that we've had and customer adoption and customer
success with the enterprise mobility suite. If you're not familiar with it, what EMS
provides is a combination of a set of categories that, up until this point, has been
discreet with point players in each one. So you're hearing about mobile device
management and increasingly turning into mobile application management where a
discreet set of folks like AirWatch and MobileIron have played. We've got a solution
there called Microsoft Intune as part of the mobile -- the enterprise mobility suite.
From an identity management perspective and actor directory and identity and
protecting user identities has always been critical to our customers. We provide an
online service called Azure Active Directory Premium that helps provide single signFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16

Mike Schutzon and authentication control for all SaaS applications, Oﬃce 365, CRM online. But
up to 2,500 other SaaS apps like Workday, like Salesforce, like others. And so IT can
help control access and maintain the security of their enterprise that are using SaaS
apps and so that's a key part of it.
Then the last component of the enterprise mobility suite is called Right
Management. And so it's a service that helps encrypt data and encrypt ﬁles and that
encryption follows the ﬁle wherever it may be. Even if it gets saved on a USB drive it
can't be accessed by unauthorized users. And so what we've done is we bring that
layered approach to security from device, application, data and the user identity
itself and wrap that into an easy to deploy, easy to purchase solution.
And so we're -- in our last report we reported 17,000 customers are using EMS today.
We continue to see great growth there and so very pleased with that. It's a perfect
companion to Oﬃce 365. We have very deep integration with the Oﬃce 365 mobile
apps on iOS as well as on the Microsoft platforms. And so we're really the only
solution that has that deep integration with Oﬃce 365, which again provides us not
only the breadth diﬀerentiation. But also the richness of the experience that we can
provide for an end user. And in this world of mobility the end user is really the king
and the queen. It really is important that the end user have a great experience, as
well as IT having the appropriate levels of control.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Got it. We're going to take plenty of questions I'm sure about the cloud stuﬀ. But
before we open it up I want to ask a few about some other areas that you have
responsibility for around the traditional enterprise side. So you I think mentioned the
Windows Server System Center and stuﬀ like that. So they all sit in the server product
realm and we get those statistics and we are impressed by them.
And the question speciﬁcally is that Microsoft has done a bang-up job on the server
product side for several years, where you've been posting growth at close to high
single digits, low double digits that far exceeded what Oracle and IBM and a lot of
your big peers are putting up. I know there's a number of reasons there. Some of it
might be share gain. Some of it might be you guys are doing a great job with your
maintenance attach rates. Some of it might be pricing licensing changes. But we're
always eager to get some color on how you've been able to pull that oﬀ. Can you
point to a couple of reasons why the server product number has over the last two
years been so good?
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
Sure. And I'll talk about Windows Server ﬁrst and I think SQL Server is an important
element there as well.
From a Windows Server perspective it continues to be the most popular operating
system on the plant. You look at all the analyst reports it's in somewhere between
70% and 80% share in terms of the operating system share.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16

{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
And where we see the continued revenue growth is because we've driven our
business model largely around mix shift to the premium SKUs. And in the Windows
Server case that really revolves around the movement to virtualization. And so as
organizations virtualize more of their applications and more of their servers, the
premium mix of Windows Server continues to grow. And so even in a world where
the x86 server shipment numbers might be soft, the premium mix as organizations
are virtualization more of their infrastructure to squeeze more of the value out of it,
we are able to beneﬁt from the increased revenue from that.
Then also, because there's so much data explosion happening you need servers to
ration across that data. And so the data explosion not only helps our SQL Server
business, which it absolutely does and I'll talk about that. But it also helps drive more
server deployments, and that not just in the cloud, it's certainly on premises, too.
And so these secular forces of virtualization and data are really helping the server
business, particularly on our premium mix.
On the SQL Server front certainly the explosion in data and the consolidation
customers are doing with respect to their database workloads is really beneﬁcial to
the SQL business; again, driving that premium shift, more cores, more premium mix
of SQL Server. And also the share gains with respect to SQL Server becoming. And
is, a very mission-critical workload now for organizations. So taking more of those
Tier 1 workloads. And if you look at Gartner's Magic Quadrant for relational database
systems, this is the ﬁrst year Microsoft has passed Oracle because of our cloud
assets, as well as the SQL Server strength on premises. And so that's really helped
fuel that growth in the traditional server business.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Okay. And on that Windows Server business, which if I'm not mistaken is the largest
component of the whole server product revenue bucket. SQL Server's obviously
pretty good as well. When we look at your total server product numbers that you do
disclose, I think in the June quarter for Microsoft it decelerated a little bit and I think
it's pulled down a little bit the commercial licensing growth number. And there
wasn't much of an explanation on the earnings call outside of I think Amy ﬂaggedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantWindows Server managing to grow despite a relatively weak x86 server market.
Could you elaborate on how the broader server product business did for Microsoft
in the June quarter and how Windows Server did in particular?
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
Well the server number all up I think in constant currency was about 9%, which did
outpace the peers on the market.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
And so a lot of that is again fueled by the innovation that we've delivered in the last
wave with Windows Server 2012, as well as some of the announcements we made in
the 2016 wave. And so we're pretty excited and the customers are pretty excited
about the 2016 wave that's in preview right now. It combines a rock-solid
virtualization platform with a lot of the new technologies that were born in Azure in
the public cloud and we're going to be able to deliver those on premises. As well as
new container technologies -- containers are pretty exciting these days -- new
container technologies that will be making it into Windows Server 2016.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
So a lot of that's fueling that growth.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Okay. I've got a few more but I know the audience probably has a couple for you,
Mike. So does anybody have any questions for Mike around Azure or around any
part of the Microsoft Server product set? We'll go right to the front here. Oh, we have
the mic in the back. Go ahead.
Yes. There's been a fair amount of buzz that given the sort of latency and the sloth
with which Microsoft -- or no, Microsoft -- MasterCard and Visa have been securing e-
commerce that you guys are having some very interest high-level discussions with
banks directly and other players about creating a browser solution that would secure
e-commerce in a way that is copacetic with the internet in general. Do you have any -FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Mike Schutz- and would likely be more operationally sound. Do you have any perspective on
that?
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
We don't have any announcements to make today. In general, whether it be in
ﬁnancial or any other vertical, we're very focused on the security element and
helping organizations be more secure in using our cloud. But also providing
products to help them secure their own. But no announcements.
Yes.
Yes. Thanks for taking my question. My question was around -- you hinted at it and
it's something that Satya has talked about as well. But just the technologies being
developed and the solutions being developed in Azure, applying those on premise
and how that's potentially enabling share gains. Can you walk through some of those
dynamics and why -- is it just faster to go to market? What's driving that improve
technology just because it's done in Azure?
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
So the way to think about it is there's a virtuous cycle between building it in the
public cloud, battle testing it in the cloud and then bringing it for our customers to
run in their own data centers. A great example here is just Hyper-V, our virtualization
platform. We've had Hyper-V for a long time. We've been a leader with VMware in
virtualization for the better part of the last decade. But now Azure runs on Hyper-V.
So you've got hundreds of thousands of nodes battle testing Hyper-V every day. That
feedback goes directly into the Hyper-V product team. They then are able to make
the product better and rock solid and then we deliver that to every customer,
whether it be an enterprise IT -- enterprise customer, a service provider. And so that -
- living the public cloud lifestyle and then helping organizations put that in their own
data center is really a diﬀerentiator for us.
Other areas where we're doing that is even just simple things like the Azure portal.
This is the place where your average IT pro or developer goes up to spin up a VM or
app on demand in Azure. We've bought that portal down so that organizations can
run that in their data center with what we call the Azure Pack. And so again, as a
service provider, I'm a hoster. I don't have to roll my own portal. I can use the one
that Microsoft built and I can focus on higher-level, value-add services. Or in the
enterprise space, where enterprises are really trying to be service providers to their
business units and be more agile, we can help them by delivering cloud computing
technologies that were battle tested in the public cloud and do that in their own
environment. Then they can still make the decision when they want to go to the
public cloud, which applications go. And by the way, once they do that, the mobility,
it's there because they've got that consistent platform on premises and oﬀ so it
provides a lot less friction for them to think about going to the public cloud. So it's
that end-to-end vision.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16

A - Mike SchutzSatya talks about this sometimes in terms of our servers as the edge of our cloud.
From a customer perspective, Azure is a seamless extension of their data center and
that's that virtuous cycle from a product development perspective. And we started
doing that in Windows Server 2012 R2, the one that's in market and it's kind of
fueling some of the growth that we see here. But it's even more so in the 2016 wave.
And so that virtuous cycle of developing in the cloud and then bringing it to our
customers on premises is really hitting its stride now. Thanks.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Anybody else? Okay, I'll keep going. Mike on the Windows Server side I think you
have a legacy version of Windows Server that's going end of life. Is that -- how big a
deal is that for Microsoft? I mean I suppose if you're up to date on your maintenance
you get that for free. But maybe there's a large constituency that are not, where
there's a revenue lift. How would you characterize it as an opportunity for Microsoft?
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
The version you speak of is Windows Server 2003.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
That's right.
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
And it actually went out of support July 15th and so we've passed that data. And so --
and as you point out, a little bit diﬀerent dynamic with XP. A lot of customers had
maintenance on the product--.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
And they hadn't yet deployed the newer version. And so our focus has been to help
customers get the newer version. But we're not necessarily focused on the revenue
uplift that that might bring.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Okay. And further on the Windows Server side, when we in this room attend the Red
Hat event it's basically a DockerCon event these days. So anything touching the
server OS layer seems to be all about containers and all about the Docker
ecosystem. And you mentioned earlier that Microsoft is providing Windows Server
2016 support for Docker. Can you elaborate a little bit on that? It just seems to be a
very big deal on the server OS space.
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 12 of 14A - Karl KeirsteadAbsolutely. In general, from a cloud native and modern app development paradigm
standpoint, the concept of micro services and containers are pretty hot these days.
And so the public cloud providers and SaaS providers are pretty ﬂuent in that and
it's starting to make its way into the broader communities. Docker has really helped
popularize it because of some of the things that they've done to make it easy to
consume containers and simplify it.
And so going back a little bit, about 18 months ago we announced we have Docker
support on the Linux in Azure. And so we've had that support for a while. We've
made a couple of announcements since then with Docker where we're integrating
the Docker Hub with Microsoft Azure and continuing to deepen that so that
organizations who would like to use containers on Linux and do it with Docker we
have prepackaged solutions in Azure to do that. As an example we've got an Ubuntu
image with the Docker tooling preinstalled that the developer can just spin up and
get going very, very quickly. And so that's the traditional Linux containers on Azure
with Docker.
We've also, as I mentioned, announced that we'll be bringing containers to Windows
Server 2016. And so we announced the Windows Server containers very similar to
what the paradigm of a Linux container, a light-weight run time that virtualizes the
operating system instead of the whole server so you can get high density and
developers can be very productive in developing and rolling out new applications.
And so that's in preview now. We've got developers trying it today and that will be
part of the 2016 wave.
We're also bringing a ﬁrst of its kind type of container called the Hyper-V container
that brings the best of high-density, light-weight containers that are known today in
the industry with the additional isolation beneﬁt that a virtualization context can
bring. One of the things that we often hear particularly from enterprises is around
the security of containers and making sure that they feel comfortable using it. And so
for customers that have untrusted third-party code that they'd like one more layer of
security in the container world we've got this Hyper-V container. And for the
developer it really doesn't make any diﬀerence because it's the same underlying
Windows Server container. It's just wrapped with another layer of security in terms of
Hyper-V virtualization context.
And so again, continue to work with Docker on this. We're in very deep
collaboration. Then also bringing new container technologies that actually don't
exist today in the rest of the market in the next Windows Server release. Then letting
developers choose. If they want to run Linux containers through our Windows
containers they can do it on Microsoft Azure.

Any last questions for Mike? Mike, I'll end with one question, then. A lot of the
discussion around things like the server OS layer and the cloud end up with a
conversation about next-gen cloud native applications, open source, etc. So it feels
to me like all of the larger ﬁrms are moving a little bit more aggressively today to try
to stay relevant in a world where the next-gen architecture and infrastructure looksFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-16

what are the kind of things Microsoft is doing to stay relevant in that new SaaS that
all the next generation of developers are building?
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
Well part of it is making sure that we're working very openly in the community,
whether it be the open source community and working with partners who are
innovating in this space so that they can leverage our platform to be able to build
those applications using those technologies.
The other is actually just using some of the innovations that we've used containers
and micro services in our own cloud for years.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
Then commercializing those and bringing those to market. And so both our own
innovation. But then working very openly in the industry and the ecosystem, like in
the open container initiative with the Linux Foundation to help bring a uniﬁed
container model to market. And so working very much with the open source
community, as well as with the development community that we've known for years.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Got it. Well Microsoft is obviously having a ton of success with the cloud platform so
these are fun days for you at Microsoft and good luck continuing to scale this
exciting part of the Microsoft story. And thanks for coming to the DB Tech event.
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
Thank you so much.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 5995559 <GO>}
Thanks for having us.
