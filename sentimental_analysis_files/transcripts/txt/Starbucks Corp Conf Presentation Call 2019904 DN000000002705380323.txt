{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
Thank you for joining us here today. We're joined with that Pat Grismer. He is the
CFO of Starbucks. I'm Katherine Fogertey, the restaurants analyst. And we're very
lucky to have Pat here today. So he has a very rich history in restaurant and consumer
broadly. He just joined Starbucks about a year ago as the CFO, but prior to that, he
held a role as CFO of Hyatt, CFO of Yum!, and also spent a good amount of time at
Disney. So good mix of consumer, restaurants and iconic brands for sure. He will
start oﬀ with a presentation and then we're going to go to some prepared Q&A I
have on my end, and then we look forward to opening it up to questions from the
group. So with that.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Thank you, Katie, and good morning, everyone, really privileged to be here with all
of you today. There are a couple of key messages that I'd like to share ahead of our
ﬁreside chat, if you will. The ﬁrst is to highlight the strength of our results in ﬁscal '19,
and the second is to clarify the broad implications of our ﬁscal '19 performance for
our preliminary outlook for ﬁscal '20.
First, I'd like to acknowledge our safe harbor statement here, as I will be making
some forward looking statements. So starting with our performance in ﬁscal '19, we
are extremely pleased with our results this year, with our non-GAAP EPS up about
16%. That's the midpoint of our current guidance range. And we believe that this
performance reinforces the strength of our growth at scale agenda, which we are
executing with focus and discipline.
And as a reminder, that agenda has three key pillars. The ﬁrst is to elevate our lead
growth markets in the US and China. The second is to extend the global reach of our
brand, notably through our global coﬀee alliance with Nestle. And the third is to
increase shareholder returns.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-04
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 2 of 15So as to that 16% non- GAAP EPS growth, that is well ahead of our original guidance,
9% growth at the midpoint. And you can see here the key drivers of that out
performance, starting with better-than-expected performance of our core business
through a combination of better-than-expected global comp sales growth, as well as
improved margin management that contributed 4 points of incremental EPS growth.
That was slightly oﬀset by 1 point of dilution from our Siren Retail business as well as
1 point of dilution from corporate G&A. You can see as well that we faced an
incremental 1 point of headwind from foreign currency translation. But you can see
that, far and away, the driver of our out performance in ﬁscal '19 relative to our
original expectations was our eﬀective tax rate. And that has signiﬁcant implications
for the shape of our growth in ﬁscal '20 as that out performance was largely driven
by one-time discrete income tax beneﬁts.
So in terms of what those implications are, you can see here the chart that starts with
our original guidance or outlook for both ﬁscal '19 non-GAAP EPS growth as well as
for ﬁscal '20. And this is as we presented it at our Investor Day last December. And
then you can see in the next four lines the individual items contributing to this year's
out performance and the corresponding implications for ﬁscal '20. So, taking each
one of these in turn, starting with our operating results.
Again, strong operating results this year, we expect that to sustain. Our operating
growth model is intact and we feel very good about the steps we are taking to drive,
both top line performance and bottom line performance. And I reaﬃrm what those
components are" top-line growth in the range of 7% to 9% and operating income
growth in the range of 8% to 10%.
As to the tax rate, again, given the onetime nature of the beneﬁts that we realized in
ﬁscal '19, you can see that it's a very signiﬁcant headwind to our EPS growth in ﬁscal
'20 as we lap those beneﬁts. And then, with respect to share repurchases, we elected
to pull forward about $2 billion worth of share repurchases that we had originally
planned for ﬁscal '20 into ﬁscal '19. And the context for that is that, in the last year,
our share price has increased by more than 80%.
So in the context of a rapidly appreciating share price, and given that we had
liquidity to do it, we pulled forward those share repurchases and were able to
preserve what we had expected by way of an EPS growth contribution from share
repurchases net of the associated interest expense. And with that pull forward, then,
there will be lower aggregate share repurchases in ﬁscal '20 and the associated EPS
beneﬁt net of interest expense on the debt issuances this year, as well as what we
expect to issue next year, will be tempered relative to our original expectations.
So you add all of that up and what that means is that for ﬁscal '20, our EPS outlook is
below our ongoing growth model of at least 10%. But again, I want to reinforce that
our growth at scale agenda is delivering against our expectations. I would say that
we're ﬁring on all cylinders from an operating performance perspective with the
focus and discipline necessary to drive growth at scale for a Company like StarbucksFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-04

Page 3 of 15Q - Katherine Fogertey

Q - Katherine Fogertey
A - Pat Grismerand our long term double digit EPS growth model is fully intact. But again, we do
expect an EPS growth outlook for ﬁscal '20, that is meaningfully below the ongoing
algorithm that we had laid out at our Investor Day.
And so, with that, I'd like to turn it over to Katie to lead us through ﬁreside chat. And
then, as Katie mentioned, happy to take questions from the audience. Thank you
very much.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. So Starbucks is one of those amazing large companies that has
such strong ties to the macro. You are beneﬁting from record low unemployment
rates, very strong wage growth. Just curious, what are you seeing right now from the
consumer, boots on the street? How is the consumer behaving right now?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
We see in the US a very healthy consumer. As I mentioned before, we're very
pleased with our operating performance in ﬁscal '19. We recently raised our
guidance for comp sales growth, given the strength of performance in the ﬁrst three
quarters. We track very carefully the APT restaurant index to understand what's
happening in the industry from a sales and transaction perspective. And I'm thrilled
to share that in the last four quarters, Starbucks has outperformed that index from a
sales perspective, in the last three quarters, outperformed from a transaction
perspective. So we are seeing a healthy consumer in the US, but also we are seeing
out performance for Starbucks on the strength of what we are doing to drive and
improve customer experience, to lead with breakthrough beverage innovation, and
then, to supplement with compelling digital initiatives.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
That's great. Actually, it tees up to my next question. You guys had a very strong cold
platform a couple of years ago and that struggled as consumer preferences
changed. You spent a lot of time developing a new cold platform. We have Nitro
now in almost all of the stores. Curious, the strength, especially with that 7% comp
that you reported last quarter, how much of what we're seeing right now is early
success on cold that is repeatable going forward versus strong macro? How would
you distinguish the two?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, a strong macro certainly is contributing to our performance this year, but as I
mentioned, there are things that are unique to Starbucks, that are driving our out
performance versus the industry generally. And I mentioned breakthrough beverage
innovations as one of those. And I would highlight within that the unique strength of
our cold beverage platform. As you mentioned, in recent years, we had seen a
decline in our cold beverage platform, largely because of the declining consumer
interest in our frappuccino line, seen as a very indulgent beverage.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-04

Page 4 of 15Q - Katherine Fogertey
A - Pat Grismer

Q - Katherine Fogertey
A - Pat GrismerAnd to your point, as consumer preferences changed, we saw the opportunity to
pivot to something new, something diﬀerent, something that was more relevant and
that spoke to consumer's desire for a lighter oﬀering. And so Cold Brew and more
recently, Nitro Cold Brew, along with our refreshers line of ﬂavored teas, have done
extremely well, not only to help replace the frappuccino business that we had lost,
but importantly, to drive improved traﬃc in the afternoon, which is where we had
seen pressure in recent years. I would say what is diﬀerent about this platform
compared to the past is that, it is resonating with consumers in terms of the type of
beverage they're looking for, something that has a very distinctive taste proﬁle, but
also is a lighter beverage, which satisﬁes what they're looking for from a wellness
perspective.
And then the other thing is that, particularly with the advent of Nitro Cold Brew,
which is a highly proprietary platform, we are now in a strong position to innovate
around that platform to bring new taste, excitement and points of diﬀerentiation for
our customers.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
Yes. We just saw the pumpkin cold brew of the Nitro. What is the exact term for that?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
The Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
So that to me, it seems like it will be a sign of innovation around that platform. I
mean, it's still early in the launch, but curious if that reception has been any diﬀerent?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
We're very pleased with how our Cold Brew and Nitro Cold Brew platforms have
been embraced by consumers generally. You'll have to wait for our Q4 earnings
release to ﬁnd out precisely how much consumers have rallied around it. But no
doubt you've seen the signiﬁcant social media and traditional media attention to
what I like to call PCCB, Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew. And I encourage all of you who
have not tried it, to go out and give it a try. It's really a sensational beverage.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
And then how should we think about, you had talked about a 1% comp lift on stores
that had Nitro? As consumer awareness grows, how is that evolving?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
The 1% you refer to is what we observed a couple of years back when we were ﬁrst
testing Nitro Cold Brew. It was part of a test market and that's what gave us
conﬁdence to proceed with the nationwide roll out. So as of the end of Q3, we were
in 5,800 Company-owned stores here in the US, on track to achieve 100%
penetration by the end of this ﬁscal year, which is into September for us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-04
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 15Q - Katherine Fogertey
A - Pat Grismer
Q - Katherine FogerteyHowever, in having crossed the 80% penetration boundary at the beginning of
August, we went on air with Nitro Cold Brew for the very ﬁrst time. So even as we
were seeing Nitro contribute to our overall comp performance on the strength of
our cold platform generally, bear in mind that through the third quarter, that was
without the aid of advertising. So we start with the advertising at beginning of
August, again, that was in the second month of our fourth ﬁscal quarter. And we're
certainly seeing good response to that.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
That's great. One of the things about Starbucks that maybe not everybody fully
appreciates is that, it is a business that runs on loyalty. So, you've talked about over
40% of the sales in your stores, Company-owned stores are coming from My
Starbucks Rewards members. You do have a very strong My Starbucks Rewards
platform, but you have a much stronger digital relationship moat out there. And so,
I'm curious, how is Starbucks going to continue to grow the My Starbucks Rewards
and what does that trajectory look like?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So there are several angles to how we look to further leverage the strength that we
have in loyalty and overall digital engagement. As you know, earlier this year, we
relaunched our Starbucks Rewards Program here in the US, with new tiers for
redemption. And we've seen, as we talked about in our Q3 earnings call,
tremendous customer acceptance of this new structure. So by continuing to innovate
around the structure of the program, it creates increased appeal for those who aren't
members of the program, who see the opportunity to earn and redeem more ﬂexibly
than before. So that's one way that is to continue to innovate around that program.
The other, to your point, Katie, is how we engage those customers who are not
members, but are nonetheless digitally engaged because they give us their email
address when they sign up to use Wi-Fi in our stores. That provides us an avenue to
communicate with them, to tell them about the beneﬁts of membership, to oﬀer
them promotions that will encourage them to come more frequently, and hopefully,
through that experience, also to understand the beneﬁts of being a member.
The last one I would highlight is mobile order and pay. And so about a year ago we
opened up mobile order and pay to customers outside of the Starbucks Rewards
Program. And what we have seen is that as customers have the opportunity to
engage with us digitally for that type of experience, they come to appreciate the
additional beneﬁts that come with being a member and having all of the functions
and features that you get through our app. So multiple ways of communicating with
and engaging those digitally registered customers in ways that motivate them to
become full ﬂedged members of Starbucks Rewards. And we continue to see that as
customers make that choice to become members, their spend increases because it
allows us to understand better their unique preferences, their buying patterns, and
therefore, to target our oﬀers to what will resonate most with them.

Q - Katherine FogerteyAnd so when we think about converting a digital customer to the MSR, clearly there's
a number of beneﬁts to bringing people onto the overall digital ecosystem in the
platform. What is the conversion rate? And you don't have to give a speciﬁc number
now, but do you see a large runway to improve that, are we running at a pretty stable
rate for converting digital to MSR? How should we think about that?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Conversion has been fairly steady. I would say given the sheer magnitude of the
digitally registered population, there's signiﬁcant potential for us to continue to drive
growth in membership and we have seen nice growth in membership. Here in the
US versus prior year, we're up in the low-to-mid teens. That's annually. So we're
seeing steady growth there, but as I mentioned before, relative to the size of the
digitally registered population, much more opportunity for us to continue to drive
membership.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
Great. So now for this part of Q&A, you have two very big markets. One is a lot
bigger than the other, but you have China and the US. And so I thought it would be
pretty interesting to sit here and compare and contrast several very important
initiatives that you have going on across these two bases. So you touched on the US
consumer being very strong. Anything in China that we should be aware of when
thinking about that market?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, we are very pleased with the overall performance of our business in China. We
have seen comps sales in last year taper. And that is consistent with what we're
observing in the market generally, which is that, while the economy continues to
grow at a relatively strong pace, it is less strong than it was two and three years ago.
And certainly, we're seeing that show up in retail footfall. We're also seeing a much
higher level of competition. I would say to a great extent, Starbucks has
demonstrated in China the appeal of the premium coﬀee specialty retail category,
and that has attracted a lot of competition, not just in coﬀee, but also in teas. So with
that, there's more competition.
The ﬁnal thing I would say that is weighing on the comp sales performance we're
seeing in China is, our own development. So as you know, for many years, we have
realized extraordinary returns in our new unit investments in China, on the order of
80% cash on cash return. So really quite extraordinary. And given the scale of the
market and our strong premium positioning, we believe that we are very well
positioned to capitalize on those trends and continue to grow at a very aggressive
pace. But that does come to some extent at the expense of comp sales growth. So
really a combination of those three, the economy being one of those.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
And are you seeing -- you hinted at cannibalizing your stores a little bit in new
markets in China? Are you seeing that more of a problem for a Tier 1 city versus Tier
2 and Tier 3? How should we think about that?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-04

Page 7 of 15A - Pat Grismer
Q - Katherine Fogertey
A - Pat Grismer
Q - Katherine Fogertey
A - Pat Grismer{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Deﬁnitely a much stronger headwind in the Tier 1 cities where we are more heavily
penetrated, where when we go in with new development, we are more apt to impact
one of our existing units. But we do that knowingly. We do that intentionally because
we're solving for the long term opportunity. And I would highlight that, in recent
years we've continued to grow our total transactions in China in the double digits
and we're growing stores in the mid teens. So we're playing the long game in China.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
All right. And just again, comparing the track mile here. Looking at the US where you
guys have just a phenomenal footprint here, are you seeing similar levels of
cannibalization when you put in new stores here as you are there? Is there any
parallel to draw?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Less cannibalization here, in part because we're growing at a slower pace. So,
whereas China, new units or net units are growing in the mid teens, our outlook for
the US is in the range of 3% to 4%, which I think is still very strong for a concept of
Starbucks' scale in the US. And what underpins that 3% to 4% growth rate is that
there are still regions in the US where Starbucks is underrepresented largely in the
center of the country and in the southeast, some parts of the northern plains. There's
a lot of white space out there for us. And we're continuing to hope and in particular,
drive through units which oﬀer even better economics because they come with
higher average unit volumes and a superior margin proﬁle.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
Perfect. Now, on drive-through delivery, all this great stuﬀ that would go side of the
equation, you have a partnership with Alibaba in China. You have announced an
exclusive with Uber Eats in the US. And I'm just curious the Chinese delivery market
much more evolved and further along than in the US. You had been trialing delivery
for a while, our survey all suggests that coﬀee is strangely, a very requested item for
delivery. So that piques my interest. What are you seeing here across both markets
on delivery?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, I'll start with China. To your point, the Chinese consumer is much more digitally
engaged. So we see higher levels of pickup and delivery overall for China. And just
to maybe level set, both the US and China for Starbucks are in their ﬁrst year of
delivery operation. So it's early days for us. And so we are rapidly learning and
adapting the model as we go. But in China, we've seen much more rapid adoption
of the delivery occasion. You mentioned our partnership with Alibaba. We could not
be happier with that relationship and how they've supported us in our growth of the
digital business, leading with delivery and now more recently with mobile order and
pay. So another angle of our digital growth agenda in China, and we're seeing very
rapid adoption.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-04

A - Pat Grismer
Q - Katherine FogerteyContrast that with the US, where we've had mobile order and pay for many years.
And that has proven to be quite successful for us. In fact, I would say and perhaps
many of you have experienced this during the peak morning hour in particular,
mobile order and pay has led to capacity constraints. I suppose it's a high quality
problem to have in retail where there's latent demand and the opportunity for us is
to unlock the capacity so that we can accommodate all of that demand. But
interestingly, in the US, as strong as mobile order and pay has been, the pickup -- the
customer pick up on delivery has been much more tempered. So we are now in a
handful of markets in the US. Expect through our partnership with Uber Eats to reach
national coverage by the early part of 2020. But I would say that our expectations are
that the business would grow over time. We know that convenience is an important
need state for customers generally, and we've found that for Starbucks speciﬁcally
that convenience is very highly valued. So we believe that over time a delivered
beverage will be more commonplace, if you will, in the US and that we would see
higher levels of acceptance. But I would say that it's building relatively slowly here in
the US.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
And what you are seeing on the delivery side, would you say you're having more
success on food delivery? Are consumers looking for food delivery over a beverage
or it's just still very early days?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, for Starbucks it is a delivered beverage with the attachment of food. And what
we are seeing in the US, one of the things we've observed across all of our markets
where we've led with delivery is a higher ticket compared to an in-store purchase.
And a contributing factor to that is a higher rate of food attach. And I think it makes
sense. If you're ordering a beverage for delivery, you might as well have some food
delivered along with it. I would say the other contributing factor and you see this
particularly in oﬃce environments, is that the average party size is higher. And again,
that makes sense. If someone in the oﬃce is ordering out for Starbucks, chances are
colleagues will hop on to that same order.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
And are you seeing anything diﬀerent with day part, with week, with the delivery
business than you are within store?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
It varies from market to market. So the very ﬁrst market that we moved into with
delivery, in fact, it was our pilot market with Uber Eats about a year ago was in Miami
and we did see stronger sales in the afternoon day part in that particular market.
We're seeing that in some other markets as well, which helps to complement with
what has been, as you know, traditionally a very heavy breakfast or morning day part.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
It's really interesting. And touching back on what you're talking about with mobile
order and pay and Alibaba in China. Is this helping to move the needle? Do you seeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-04

Q - Katherine Fogertey
A - Pat Grismerthis as an opportunity to help drive more of a morning day part in China, how our
customers using mobile order and pay there?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
We do see that over time it will be helpful to us in terms of how we can better
distribute our sales across the day. What you've highlighted is that in China, as
opposed to the US, we have a stronger afternoon day part. And so we do have more
capacity in the morning. I do think that mobile order and pay helps to facilitate an
established routine. So I think that has more Chinese consumers move into coﬀee
and they understand the important role that coﬀee can play in one's morning
routine. So, that will help to facilitate the growth of that day part?
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
Yes, I very much understand the importance of coﬀee in the morning routine. And
so, you referenced just a little bit with the rise of mobile order and pay in the US, but
I think it's actually a very good point. We go into some of these stores, especially the
stores in heavy transit areas in New York where, mobile order and pay is just
swamping the stores, you walk in and their is just cups everywhere and a lot of
crowd. And it's certainly a high class problem to have. But how are you guys thinking
about the evolution of this business? And does it make sense to have a third space
for mobile order and pay or should they exist in two separate locations?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So we are in the process of rolling out improvements to what we call the hand oﬀ
plane, which is where you see those mobile orders accumulating in order to facilitate
that part of the customer experience. You may have observed, particularly in stores
in major metro areas like Manhattan, we are deploying additional labor in front of
the counter to help direct traﬃc, if you will, to guide mobile order and pay customers
to where those orders are accumulating and to hand oﬀ those orders to customers
as they come in.
At the same time, we are looking over the next year to improve what we call order
sequencing, so that we can better stage or sequence orders that are taken inside the
store, as well as those that are coming in digitally in order to prepare the beverages
in a sequence that better matches the arrival sequence of customers. So, a number
of things we're looking to do to improve the experience for our partners, as well as
for our customers, and with that, to unlock some of those capacity constraints so that
we can accommodate more of the latent demand that time of day
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
On that point on frequency, is it taking into account of customer's location where
they have placed the mobile order and pay?

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
Okay. I can start opening it up to Q&A, I have more questions, but does anybody in
the group have a question? Okay. On the labor front, labor wage inﬂation has been
such a huge pressure to all the restaurant companies right now. And you deﬁnitely
pay, I would say, above minimum wage to your partners and provide them with a lot
of really good beneﬁts. But you have also been doing a lot on the operations front to
help streamline that process in the stores. So I was wondering if you could help us
understand what are the things you're doing? How is this translating on the labor
line and also to guest satisfaction?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So what we're looking to do is to reduce non-customer facing tasks through
technology and improved processes, so that we can devote more partner time to the
customer facing experience, if you will. So it's not about necessarily driving
eﬃciencies that drop through to the bottom line, but allowing us to reallocate our
hours in ways that help to sustain robust top-line growth. That would include what
we're doing to re-engineer our cleaning processes, what we're doing to re-engineer
our inventory management processes and also enhance our labor scheduling, both
the speed and eﬃciency with which those schedules are set, but also to more
intelligently allocate those hours and schedule those hours to the times of the day
and to the tasks that are going to have the greatest impact on the partner-customer
experience. So, for us, it's about ﬁnding those eﬃciencies that allow us to make the
important investments in partner labor that are fundamental to Starbucks. We think
that it's an important competitive advantage for us and it's something that we're
going to continue to invest in.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
And how have the better customer scores, has that translated into sales growth for
you guys?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
We do see a strong correlation between our customer connection scores and comp
sales by store. So we are very much of the belief that driving an improved customer
experience, which starts with providing an extraordinary partner experience, is
essential to our ability to drive comp sales on an ongoing basis here in the US in the
range of 3% to 4%, which is part of our long term growth model.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
Okay. Yep. Back.
Just to piggyback oﬀ that question a little bit. On the wage and labor front,
obviously, there's a lot of concern out there about the domestic recessionary
pressures and the like that doesn't appear to be showing up in consumer focused
data. But with respect to the labor and wage situation, are you feeling any pressureFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-04

Page 11 of 15A - Pat Grismer
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Pat Grismerright now in terms of competition from competitors in the sense that they're luring
away your employees at a higher wage? Do you feel pressure to pay more? Or are
you seeing that seem to taper oﬀ a little bit, corroborating some of the worries that
are out there?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
The current situation is largely unchanged from what we've experienced in recent
years, which is that, to the point Katie made, given what our pay practices have been
historically, we have had a bit of a leg up on the competition. But beyond the wage
rate is the compelling beneﬁts package that we oﬀer it, which is really, I think,
unmatched in the retail space. And that's an important asset for us as it relates to our
ability to attract and retain really strong retail talent.
Three part question. Can you ﬁrst talk about food? You've made some acquisitions
over the years, but I think your progress in food has been somewhat underwhelming.
Second question is alcohol. You've made some initiatives in alcohol sales. I'm
wondering what your thoughts are on that? And thirdly, Luckin Coﬀee and if you
could comment on them?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Certainly. So starting with food. You are right to notice that as we talk about the key
drivers of our growth going forward, food does not ﬁgure prominently in that
strategy. And it's not to say that food is not important to our business. Current sales
mix is, I think, around 21%. So it's a decent part of our business, but as I mentioned
before, our growth at scale agenda has been to a signiﬁcant extent rooted in focus
and discipline. And when you think about a company of scale like Starbucks, given
our stature as a brand and our scale globally, to sustain double digit EPS growth
over the long term requires considerable focus and discipline.
One element of focus is being very clear about what our points of diﬀerentiation are
and putting our eﬀort, energy and resources behind those key points of
diﬀerentiation. For us, in relation to product oﬀerings, that's about beverages. So the
innovation focus for us in terms of what's going to drive the top-line is around
beverages. Food, I would say, is somewhat secondary in the sense that we see food
as a complement to beverages, helps to build a ticket. It helps to build out additional
day parts, but it is not necessarily a key point of diﬀerentiation for us. Our goal is to
make sure that it is of consistently high quality, consistent with the Starbucks brand
and that our food products pair well with our innovative beverage oﬀerings. So that's
food.
With respect to alcohol, I think, what you have seen have been isolated examples.
We don't see alcohol as ﬁguring prominently into our growth strategy going
forward. There may be unique occasions or instances, for example, in our roasteries
or maybe from time to time in some of our reserve stores, but it will not ﬁgure
prominently in our growth strategy going forward.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-04

Q - Katherine FogerteyAnd ﬁnally, in relation to Luckin, it's been interesting to see the growth and the
evolution of that concept here in the last couple of years. I have to say that their unit
growth is impressive. They I think for the ﬁrst time as a publicly held company
reported results in the month of August. And with those results, what we saw was
that their unit count in China is about 25% lower than Starbucks at that point in time,
and their average unit volumes about 75% lower or one-fourth Starbucks average
unit volume. So you add those two things together, and even with all their growth,
they're 80% smaller than Starbucks, one ﬁfth the size of Starbucks in China. But they
have grown very rapidly.
I think it's important to highlight that they're going after a diﬀerent occasion. Their
occasion is not a third place occasion. They don't have cafes designed the way ours
are. That I think is reﬂected in their very low average unit volume and they satisfy
again, a diﬀerent occasion at a diﬀerent price point, which also implies a diﬀerent
quality oﬀering. So they are going after a diﬀerent segment in the market. It's not to
say that we should dismiss the presence that they've established, but also bear in
mind that they have done that on the back of extreme marketing and very
aggressive discounts. And I think it remains to be seen how they will be able to
sustain that growth as over time they will be compelled to strip away their marketing
and their aggressive discounts. So, we're continuing to watch to see what they do. I
mentioned earlier that one of the three contributing factors to the tapering of comp
growth in China for Starbucks has been competition generally. I would say not
necessarily Luckin speciﬁcally, but they've been part of that mix.

Yes. Okay. I mean, you referenced earlier, you guys pulled forward $2 billion of
buyback into this year, it's more of a strategic decision. So, I'm just curious, you have
so much dry powder on your balance sheet. You probably could raise more capital if
you wanted to from the credit markets. Why was it a pull forward and why not
accelerated share returns here? Or do you need to have more cash on the balance
sheet for other items?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
We don't need to have more cash on the balance sheet for other items as the
Company undertook a review of its capital structure about a year ago. The decision
was made to pivot to a more highly leveraged model, but still well below our peer
companies in the category. So settling in at a still investment-grade credit at a
leverage ratio on lease adjusted EBITDA of no more than 3 times and a credit rating
of BBB+, Baa1 which I think for Starbucks is a terriﬁc place to be in terms of how it
improves our overall cost of capital, but still gives us the ﬂexibility to make the kinds
of investments that we believe are instrumental to our ability to sustain long term
growth.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
And then on the CapEx front, you've had a pretty healthy CapEx budget as you're
building up stores in the US and in China. And you referenced earlier the scale of US
adds is slowing here. Is the current run rate a good run rate for CapEx? Is thereFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-04

Page 13 of 15A - Pat Grismer
Q - Katherine Fogertey
A - Pat Grismersomething that would cause it to remain higher than unit growth over time? How
should we think about CapEx?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, I would ﬁrst clarify that when we say run rate, not speaking to, say, the last three
to ﬁve years when CapEx increased very dramatically, but really looking at what our
current spend rate is this year, I see the opportunity for that to temper when you take
into account a couple of things. The ﬁrst is that as we bring increasing focus to our to
lead growth markets, the US and China, that implies that over time, we will be
transitioning other Company-owned markets to the license model, as we did this
past year with France, Netherlands and most recently, Thailand. And there are some
other Company-owned positions that would make sense at the right time, under the
right circumstances to transition to a license model. And so that will provide some
relief to our total capital spend.
That, in addition to Siren Retail, which as our CEO, Kevin Johnson, highlighted a little
over a year ago at the Oppenheimer conference, has been ring fenced with the
opening of our Chicago roastery later this year, which we're very excited about, that
will signal the end of roastery development. And there's been quite signiﬁcant
capital investment against our roastery portfolio in the last three years or so. And so
as we bring that program to completion, then we would again expect a more
tempered level of capital spend.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
Great. On the channel development side, you guys are adding more countries here.
Can you help us understand how this business evolves and how the cost structure
and revenue opportunity is as you add more countries?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So with the global coﬀee alliance with Nestle, we are excited about how that is going
to further unlock the opportunity for us to drive the presence of the Starbucks brand
in consumer products goods channels, not only traditional grocery retail, but also in
food service. And to-date, we are in 16 countries and we expect that with the
relationship with Nestle that we will be able to penetrate very rapidly the remaining,
60 to 65 markets where we have a retail presence.
One of the things we've observed is that, it makes sense to lead with specialty retail,
to establish the brand. That creates awareness, that creates brand preference and
then to follow with consumer packaged goods. And Nestle has the global
infrastructure in consumer packaged goods to accomplish that at an accelerated
pace, certainly much faster than we could have on our own, which was the
underlying driver of that relationship that was established a little over a year ago.
How that relates to our revenue growth is that, we do earn a royalty on those sales
and we also receive a markup on some of the ﬁnished products that we continue to
manufacturer for Nestle to distribute. So there is an ongoing revenue stream in the
form of royalties and product markups that follows the market expansion plan that IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-04

A - Pat Grismermentioned. With respect to the overall proﬁtability, we continue to expect for our
channel development segment operating margin in the mid-30% range. So, decent
margins on that business.
{BIO 15247533 <GO>}
And then I have one last question for you. We have 30 seconds left. So one year in
almost at Starbucks. What do you think is the greatest challenge here for Starbucks
as we look ahead?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
The greatest challenge for Starbucks is how to continue to reduce the operational
complexity of our retail stores. When you think about the volumes that we process
through our stores, transaction volumes, they're quite extraordinary, particularly at
peak. And when you consider how we're continuing to introduce new beverage
innovation, that adds another layer of operational complexity. As I mentioned before,
however, what's fundamental to our success as a brand, what we see is our number
one competitive advantage is the unique experience we provide in our stores and at
the center of that, the connection that exists between our partners and our
customers. So ﬁnding ways to continue to drive volume and drive innovation while
reducing operational complexity that helps to unlock capacity and facilitates even
deeper connections between our partners and our customers, that, I would say, is
the key.
And a corollary to that from a ﬁnancial perspective is how we pace and sequence the
investments necessary to enable that reduction in operational complexity even as we
innovate, because we believe that continuing to invest behind growth is important. It
does weigh on our operating margin, but we believe that it's essential to our ability
to drive top-line growth consistently over the long term. And as I mentioned before
at the outset of the presentation, we continue to be very conﬁdent in the robustness
of our double digit EPS growth model at scale.
