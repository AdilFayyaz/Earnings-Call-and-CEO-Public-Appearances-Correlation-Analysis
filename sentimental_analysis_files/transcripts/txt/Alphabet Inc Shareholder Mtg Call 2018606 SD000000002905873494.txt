Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Alphabet's 2018 Annual
Shareholder Meeting. I'm John Hennessy, Chairman of the Board of Directors of
Alphabet. And I'll be presiding over this meeting.
Each of you should have registered as you arrived. If anyone is not registered for the
meeting, please register before leaving today. Each of you also should have received
an agenda. On the reverse side of the agenda is a list of the rules of procedures forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 2 of 24David C. Drummondthe meeting. And we ask that you abide by those rules. At this time, I call the 2018
meeting of the shareholders to order.
I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce a few people. First of all, Eric Schmidt,
sitting here in the front. I think as you all know, Eric served as our CEO for the ﬁrst 10
years of our company. And then as Executive Chair for six years. And under his
incredible leadership, Google and then Alphabet have really thrived. So thank you,
Eric, for that incredible leadership and inspiration.
I'd also like to introduce Diane Greene, also a member of the Board of Directors,
sitting up here in the front. Then some of our management team here today: Ruth
Porat, our CFO; David Drummond, who'll be up shortly, our Senior Vice President of
Business Development; and Eileen Naughton, where's Eileen? There you are, Vice
President of People Operations.
Also with us today is Maura Stanley, a representative of Computershare, our transfer
agent, who will act as the Inspector of Elections; and Andrew Cotton and Matthew
Sapp, representatives of Ernst & Young, our independent accountants.
I'd now like to ask David Drummond, Alphabet's Senior Vice President, Corporate
Development, Chief Legal Oﬃcer and Secretary, to come up. David will conduct the
formal portion of the meeting. Following that, Sundar Pichai, our Chief Executive
Oﬃcer of Google. And I will be back to talk about some -- give some comments on
the company and have a question-and-answer period. David?
{BIO 1952796 <GO>}
Thanks, John. Welcome, everyone, to the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. A
quick note before we begin the business about the logistics for today's meeting. We
have some rules of procedure. And as stated in the rules, stockholders shouldn't
address the meeting until you're recognized. We'll provide a 20-minute Q&A
session, as John mentioned, following the business of the meeting. And you'll have
an opportunity to ask questions then. Now if you want to ask a question during that
period, please move to the microphone stands, which we'll have in the aisles. And
then introduce yourself as a stockholder. And after being recognized, you can go
ahead and ask your question. So thanks in advance for cooperating with the rules.
And we'll hopefully not have to intervene to remove anyone, et cetera, if you're
violating the rules.
So I received the aﬃdavits of mailing from Computershare and from Broadridge,
which state that the notice of the meeting was duly given. All stockholders of Class A
and/or Class B common stock as of the close of business on April 18, 2018, are
entitled to vote at today's meeting.
In addition, I've been advised by the Inspector of Election that the holders of our
outstanding Class A and Class B stock, representing at least a majority of the voting
power of the outstanding Class A and Class B stock entitled to vote, are representedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06

Page 3 of 24Abigail Shawin person or by proxy at today's meeting. So therefore, a quorum is present. The
meeting is duly constituted. And the business of the meeting may proceed.
The ﬁrst item of business is the election of directors. We have 11 directors to be
elected at today's meeting. And those directors that are elected today will hold
oﬃce until the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Board of Directors has
nominated the following individuals: Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Eric Schmidt, John
Doerr, Roger Ferguson, Diane Greene, John Hennessy, Ann Mather, Alan Mulally,
Sundar Pichai and Ram Shriram. Now our bylaws require that stockholders provide
advance notice of their intent to nominate persons as directors. We haven't received
any such notice. So accordingly, I declare the nominations for directors closed.
Now the next matter being submitted to our stockholders is the ratiﬁcation of the
appointment of Ernst & Young as our independent registered public accounting ﬁrm
for the 2018 ﬁscal year. Our Board of Directors has recommended that our
stockholders ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young as our independent registered
public accounting ﬁrm for 2018.
The next matter being submitted to our stockholders is the approval of amendments
to Alphabet's 2012 Stock Plan to increase the share reserve under the plan by
11,500,000 shares of Class C capital stock and to prohibit the repricing of stock
options granted under the 2012 stockholder plan without shareholder approval.
Now our Board of Directors has recommended that our stockholders approve these
amendments to the 2012 Stock Plan. And that's described in detail in our proxy
statement.
Now the next 7 items being submitted are stockholder proposals. Our Board of
Directors has unanimously recommended that our stockholders vote against all 7
stockholder proposals that will be presented.
Now the ﬁrst stockholder proposal is brought by James McRitchie, Myra K. Young
and The NorthStar Asset Management Funded Pension Plan as the co-lead ﬁlers. I
believe Abigail Shaw is here. And she'll be presenting the proposal. You have a total
of 3 minutes to make a statement. And I'll advise you when your time is about to
expire. Please proceed.
Good morning. My name is Abigail Shaw from NorthStar Asset Management in
Boston, the beneﬁcial owner of 6,559 shares of Class A stock at Alphabet. Fellow
shareholders, I am here to represent Resolution #4, a good governance proposal
about equal voting rights. When shareholders of common stock do not have an
equal right to weigh in on signiﬁcant governance matters, we subject ourselves to
greater ﬁnancial risk. When Alphabet went public, shareholders already lacked the
opportunity to give substantive input into matters of policy. Alphabet's voting
structure is heavily weighed to favor insiders, given that Class B shares are granted
10x the voting rights of Class A shares. Matters were made worse when Class B
insiders voted in a brand-new class of stock with 0 voting rights.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 24David C. Drummond
Lila HolzmanThe fact that this was approved is particularly remarkable, because our calculations
show that only 15% of Class A outside shares that voted approved of establishing
Class C capital stock. How is this possible? Well this measure passed because Mr.
Brin and Mr. Page, who currently own 12% of the outstanding shares of the company,
together have 56% of the voting power. While we can ignore this reality when proﬁts
are up, this voting structure constitutes a considerable risk to governance and
shareholder value.
All we need to do is look north about 7 miles to Facebook headquarters to see what
may happen when shareholders are unable to provide meaningful feedback.
Facebook's recent data scandals should be a warning to all Alphabet shareholders
as well. In late March, CNNMoney reported that Facebook has lost $80 billion in
market value since its data scandal. Worse, Facebook shareholders are in a position
where a board member is directly connected to the private company at the heart of
the scandal, yet they cannot vote out that board member.
Alphabet shareholders need to heed the warning that poor governance can and
likely will result in an eventual downturn in shareholder value. We are very
concerned about the governance risk that comes from relying upon merely 2 or 3
people's visions and their ability to reduce threats to the company long term without
broad input.
The founders brought this company to fruition and led it into proﬁtability. But the
company's decision to oﬀer common shares of the company on public exchanges,
making Alphabet a public company, brings with it a responsibility to shareholders to
practice good governance. Shareholders, we urge you to vote for Proxy Item #4.
{BIO 1952796 <GO>}
Thank you, Ms. Shaw. Appreciate it.
The second stockholder proposal is being brought by Walden Asset Management as
the lead ﬁler, joined by the Benedictine Sisters of Monasterio Pan De Vida; the
Benedictine Sisters of Cullman, Alabama; The Benedictine Sisters of Baltimore Mercy
Investment Services; The Oblate International Pastoral Investment Trust and a
number of other individuals and organizations as co-ﬁlers. Lila Holzman, I believe, is
here. And she'll be presenting this proposal. Ms. Holzman, you have 3 minutes.
Mr. Chairman and fellow shareholders, my name is Lila Holzman. And I am
presenting on behalf of Walden Asset Management, the primary sponsor of this
proposal, whose company owns approximately 257,000 shares of Alphabet. I work
as the Energy Program Manager at As You Sow, a shareholder engagement nonproﬁt
in Oakland. On behalf of Walden and approximately 15 co-ﬁlers, I am pleased to
move this resolution, which has been voted on by Alphabet's stockholders for
several years and seeks information on how Alphabet directly and indirectly works to
aﬀect legislation and public policy.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 24David C. DrummondOn behalf of Walden, let me start by thanking Alphabet for your leadership on
climate change, both by reducing your greenhouse gas emissions and by speaking
out to support the Paris accord. This public voicing of our views sends a clear
message to legislators on where we stand. Thank you.
We also commend management for its fruitful dialogue with investors regarding
political candidate contributions. The company agreed to expand its disclosures on
political spending. And the resolution was withdrawn. Walden and the cosponsors
are more than willing to have a constructive dialogue that could lead to the
withdrawal of this resolution as well and will reach out after this AGM.
Lobbying is big business and controversial for Alphabet. In the last three years,
Alphabet spent over $50 million in federal lobbying. As one of the top-5 lobbying
companies, our lobbying has been proﬁled in 60 Minutes as part of a critical
exposÃ© on Google.
While Alphabet discloses a summary of its direct federal lobbying online with links to
quarterly reports provided to the Senate, these are very diﬃcult to navigate. It would
be so easy for Alphabet to summarize the dollars spent and the major issues we
lobbied on accompanying the Senate report links.
Importantly, Alphabet does not disclose meaningful details on dues and grants
provided to the many advocacy and trade groups it's a part of, or how it evaluates
whether the lobbying of these organizations is consistent with Alphabet's priorities,
values and position of do no evil. Additional disclosure is needed here.
We congratulate Alphabet for publicly withdrawing from ALEC, a group that
combats clean energy. In doing so, Alphabet acted on its stated values, a step we
commend. However, Alphabet remains a member of other trade associations, whose
actions conﬂict with its values, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has spent
over 1.3 billion on lobbying since 1998 and aggressively opposes climate change
solutions. This is in clear conﬂict with our stated position on the need to limit the
eﬀects of climate change. Apple responded to the Chamber's practices by
withdrawing. We urge Alphabet to express its stated policies by speaking out,
challenging the Chamber's actions and lobbying with other companies inside the
chamber to change its counterproductive climate policies. While Alphabet is a
leader in articulating and working to abide by positive social and environmental
values, our company's vision and environmental ethics deserve to be reﬂected in
how our lobbying dollars are spent. We look forward to future dialogue on this issue.

Thank you very much, Ms. Holzman.
The third stockholder proposal is being brought by Arjuna Capital on behalf of its
clients, Proxy Impact -- sorry, Proxy Impact on behalf of CB Wealth Generation. And
Baldwin Brothers on behalf of Dylan Sage as co-ﬁlers. I believe we have FarnumFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06

David C. DrummondBrown here, who's here to present. Hi, Mr. Brown. You have 3 minutes. Please
proceed.
{BIO 4176940 <GO>}
My name is Farnum Brown. And I move proposal #6 on behalf of Arjuna Capital and
co-ﬁlers Proxy Impact and Baldwin Brothers Inc. asking for a report on gender pay
equity. This is the third year this proposal has gone to a vote. And we acknowledge
incremental progress, yet critical concerns remain unaddressed.
The median income for women working full time in the United States is 80% of that
earned by men, a gap that is not expected to close for 40 years. Of note, the gap for
African-American and Latina women is wider at 60% and 55%, respectively. Gender
and intersecting racial pay inequity represent a structural barrier to diverse
leadership, posing a risk to company performance and investor returns.
Of particular note, the United Kingdom now mandates disclosure of median gender
pay gaps. In the U.S., investor engagement has thus far led to disclosures not on
median pay. But on statistically adjusted equal pay for equal work numbers,
assessing the pay of men and women performing similar jobs. Google says the
company pays women fairly on this basis, although the company excludes from its
analysis the compensation of highly paid positions of Vice President and above.
More importantly, the equal pay for equal work number considered alone fails to
address how discrimination aﬀects diﬀerences in opportunity. That is, it does not
reﬂect the structural bias that aﬀects the jobs women hold. The median pay gap
does reﬂect this structural bias in cases where men hold the majority of higher-
paying jobs. Google reports the median pay gap for its United Kingdom operations
is near 11%. But has not published information on its global operations.
Top proxy adviser, Institutional Shareholders Services, ISS, recommends support for
this proposal, noting "the equal pay for equal work statistic does not address the
reported systemic bias and segregation into lower-paying jobs. That systemic bias
could make it harder for Google to recruit and retain women in its workforce and
could increase its exposure to regulatory risk as more jurisdictions seek to pass laws
and regulations to close the gender pay gap. Disclosing more information about the
risk that it faces in diﬀerent jurisdictions related to a gender pay gap would provide
shareholders with useful information about how eﬀectively management is assessing
and mitigating that risk. Therefore, support for this resolution is warranted."
{BIO 1952796 <GO>}
Thanks very much, Mr. Brown.
The next proposal, which is proposal #7 in the proxy, is being brought by John
Chevedden. I believe Ms. Holzman, you are presenting again on this proposal?

David C. Drummond
Irene KnappOn behalf of John Chevedden of Redondo Beach, California, I'm presenting
proposal 7 regarding a simple majority vote. Shareholders request that the board
take the steps necessary so that each voting requirement in the charter and bylaws
that calls for a greater than simple majority vote be eliminated and replaced by a
requirement for a majority of the votes cast for and against applicable proposals, or
a simple majority in compliance with state law. The full text of the proposal is in the
annual meeting proxy booklet.
{BIO 1952796 <GO>}
Thanks very much. So let's move on to the next proposal, which is proposal #8 in the
proxy statement. And that's being brought by Zevin Asset Management as the lead
ﬁler on behalf of Carol A. Reisen, along with a number of other co-ﬁlers. And Irene
Knapp, a fellow character Googler, I believe, will be presenting the proposal. So you
have 3 minutes.
My name is Irene Knapp. And I'm an engineer at Google. On behalf of Zevin Asset
Management and concerned employees of Alphabet and its subsidiaries, I hereby
move proposal #8.
Integrating executive performance measures with diversity and inclusion metrics will
further our company's values, address long-term human capital risks. And make it
clear that diversity and inclusion are a business priority throughout the organization.
Diversity and inclusion are key components of business sustainability and success.
McKinsey & Company research shows that companies in the top quartiles for gender
and racial and ethnic diversity were more likely to have above-average ﬁnancial
returns.
Yet at Alphabet, diversity and inclusion activities by individual contributors and
managers alike, including mentorship, outreach and community building, have been
met with a disorganized array of responses, including formal reprimand. The lack of
clear communicated policies and actions to advance diversity and inclusion, with
concrete accountability and leadership from senior executives, has left many of us
feeling unsafe and unable to do our work. The chilling eﬀect of harassment and
doxxing has impaired productivity and company culture. Responses from HR have
been inadequate, leaving minority communities unprotected. Now we are forced to
weigh the risks to ourselves before giving each other support. This backwards
response is tied to immediate retention issues as entire support networks shut down
in fear.
The proposed metrics will incentivize long-term progress on diversity and inclusion.
However, Alphabet must also immediately address human capital risk by improving
its code of conduct, by cracking down on malicious leaks that have intimidated
individuals, by publishing to employees a manual formalizing procedures for HRFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06

Justin Danhofinvestigations. And by ﬁnding a solution for bad-faith HR complaints. We are hopeful
that executives are ﬁnding ways to implement these solutions as concerned
employees requested two months ago. It is our belief as investors, as engineers and
as technical professionals, that a lack of executive leadership around sustainability,
diversity and inclusion fundamentally hurts the quality of products Alphabet can
deliver to users. As a company that aims to focus on the next billion Internet users
and bring the convenience and power of information access to them, Alphabet must
credibly integrate diversity and inclusion into its strategy.
Today, it is clear that Alphabet shareholders are listening to employees' experience
and standing with us as we all challenge our company to be better. Together, we are
sending a strong message to Alphabet leadership that they must prioritize diversity
and inclusion in the interest of all employees and of long-term investor value. We
urge our fellow shareholders to support proposal #8.
{BIO 1952796 <GO>}
Thank you very much, Irene. Much appreciated.
The next stockholder proposal is being brought by the National Center for Public
Policy Research. Justin Danhof, I believe, is here. Welcome back, Justin. And he'll be
presenting. You have 3 minutes.
My name is Justin Danhof from the National Center for Public Policy Research. And I
rise to move proposal 9, which seeks to increase ideological diversity on the
company's board. In recent weeks, both Amazon and Facebook have agreed to
terms with the SEIU to alter their respective board selection procedures. Rather than
appointing the best person for the job, they have adopted an aﬃrmative action plan,
sometimes known as the Rooney Rule after the NFL. This is designed to increase
female and minority board membership. But these policies are often demeaning to
the selected candidates because they know that's the only reason they were
selected. And they're racist and sexist to boot.
We propose something diﬀerent. Rather than promoting racism and sexism, we urge
Alphabet to consider viewpoint diversity when it makes its board selections. Silicon
Valley elites often preen about their commitment to diversity and inclusion. But I
don't think many of you know what that means. Diversity isn't what someone looks
like. Let me say that again so people understand. Diversity is not what someone
looks like. It's the sum of what they think, they feel and they believe. And at this
company, it appears that thinking and believing in conservative policies is verboten.
At last year's shareholder meeting, I asked the company's executives if conservative
and libertarian opinions were welcome at Alphabet, in light of the company's
numerous public policy positions that all seem to be left of center. Mr. Schmidt
essentially told me that the company would never reconsider any of its policy
positions, because everyone in this company believes the same exact things. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 24David C. Drummond
Farnum Brownfrankly he said, in Silicon Valley, we have the same belief system. Obviously, that's
not true. Many Google employees e-mailed me after the meeting, thanking me for
saying publicly what they're petriﬁed to say within the walls of this community.
Soon after the meeting, the company also very publicly ousted engineer, James
Damore. He simply suggested concrete ways to increase Alphabet's gender
diversity. Apparently, he was ousted because he referred to human biology. I
thought Alphabet was committed to science. I guess not.
Even the far-left New York Times ran an article critical of the company's handling of
the Damore situation. It noted, "Damore is describing a truth on one level. His critics
are describing a diﬀerent truth, one that exists on another level. He is championing
scientiﬁc research. They are championing gender equality. It takes a little subtlety to
harmonize these strands. But it's doable." The article then chastised Google CEO,
Sundar Pichai, for lying about the memo and simply joining with the liberal mob in
ousting Damore. That Pichai still has a job shows that the board's liberal groupthink
problem is pervasive.
Recently, more than a dozen prominent conservative organizations have combined
forces to try and combat Google's censorship of their work. Google's search results
have also recently labeled conservative politicians as bigots and Nazis.
All of this points to the necessity of implementing our proposal. We believe that
boards that incorporate diverse perspectives can think more critically and oversee
corporate managers more eﬀectively. Appointing a few conservatives may help the
company avoid groupthink. That's a win for investors and a win for true diversity.
Please vote yes on proposal 9.
{BIO 1952796 <GO>}
Thank you. So the ﬁnal stockholder proposal, which is proposal #10 in the proxy
statement, is being brought also by Arjuna Capital on behalf of its clients as lead
ﬁler. And The New York State Common Retirement Fund as well as Bruce Alexander
Gaguine as co-ﬁlers. Farnum Brown will be presenting this proposal as well. Mr.
Brown?
{BIO 4176940 <GO>}
My name is Farnum Brown. And I'm here to move Proposal #10 on behalf of Arjuna
Capital and co-ﬁlers, including The New York State Common Retirement Fund.
We are asking our company to publish a report on content governance. From
political subterfuge, fake news, hate speech and sexual harassment, it is clear that
content that violates Google's own terms of service poses a risk to the company's
market value and brand. Last year, at this very meeting, we highlighted the risks
posed by fake news propagated over the platform. And while our board opposed
reporting, we learned six months later. And only through congressional testimony,
that abuse of the YouTube platform was far greater than previously acknowledged.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 24David C. DrummondAnd that Russian agents uploaded more than 1,000 propaganda videos prior to the
2016 U.S. presidential election.
In December, YouTube's CEO, Susan Wojcicki, acknowledged that "some bad actors
are exploiting YouTube's openness to mislead, manipulate, harass or even harm."
She promised to "stay one step ahead of bad actors, making it harder for policy-
violating content to surface or remain on YouTube."
It is clear however, that the company's response to mounting controversies and
enforcement of its terms of service continues to be problematic. An April 2018 CNN
investigation found that YouTube channels carried ads from over 300 companies
and organizations promoting, among other things, white nationalists, Nazis,
pedophilia and North Korean propaganda. And an April 2018 CBS poll found a
majority of Americans say tougher government regulations are needed to rein in the
power of Google and other social media companies. Fines and regulation by
governments, lost advertising revenue and a soured brand pose a risk to investment
returns. We believe Google's ability to proactively assess its content governance,
reporting mechanisms and enforcement capabilities will inform how successfully the
platform will navigate a complex landscape.
Leading proxy adviser, Institutional Shareholder Services, ISS, agrees, noting, "The
company does seem to be responding to each content management-related
controversy in a reactive way. Shareholders would beneﬁt from additional disclosure
reviewing and compiling in one report the eﬃcacy of its enforcement of its terms of
service related to content policies and assessing the risks posed by content
management controversies with statistics on the percentage of content that is
ﬂagged as oﬀensive and how that may change over time, how quickly content is
removed if it is oﬀensive, or other appropriate quantitative metrics. Therefore, this
proposal merits shareholder support."
{BIO 1952796 <GO>}
Thanks very much, Mr. Brown. So because no further business is scheduled to come
before the stockholders, the polls are now open. Now if you've already voted by
proxy, you don't need to vote today, unless you'd like to change your vote. And I
should also let you know that we've received suﬃcient proxies before the meeting to
know that the proposals we discussed today will either pass or fail in accordance
with the recommendations made by our board that are outlined in the proxy
statement. However, we want to make sure that everybody gets a chance to vote. So
if you want to vote. And you requested a ballot when you registered for the meeting,
please complete it now. And we'll give you a few moments to do that. And I think we
have some folks who would -- will collect some ballots, if you've got them.
(Voting)
Okay. Looks like we've collected all the ballots in the room. So I hereby declare the
polls for each matter voted upon at the meeting closed and direct the Inspector of
Elections to collect the ballots. Well I guess, we've collected them all.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 11 of 24John L. HennessyAnd so we can move on to the next segment. So oﬃcially, I've been advised by the
Inspector of Elections that the nominees for the election to the Board of Directors
have been duly elected. I've also been advised by the Inspector of Elections that a
majority of the shares of our Class A and B common stock entitled to vote and
present at the meeting in person or by proxy voted in favor of proposals 2 and 3. So
therefore, each of these proposals has been approved by our stockholders.
I've also been advised by the Inspector of Elections that the majority of our shares of
our Class A and Class B common stock entitled to vote and present at the meeting in
person or by proxy have voted against proposals 4 through 10. So therefore, each of
these stockholder proposals have not been approved by our stockholders. So as
soon as possible after the meeting, we'll complete the ﬁnal vote tabulations. And
we'll provide ﬁnal vote results on our Investor Relations website and also in a ﬁling
with the SEC.
So that ends the oﬃcial business of the meeting. And I declare the formal portion of
the meeting adjourned. John and Sundar will now make some remarks. And after
those remarks, we'll have a 20-minute question-and-answer session.
Since I'm a lawyer, I'm obliged to provide this ﬁnal note that our statements, remarks,
presentations, answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements
about our business look -- outlook and other matters. So actual results and outcomes
for these matters may diﬀer from any forward-looking statements we might make
due to a number of risks and uncertainties. Those risks are described in detail in our
public ﬁndings with the SEC.
So I'll now turn the meeting back to John.
{BIO 1433018 <GO>}
Thank you, David. As David said, Sundar will be up in a few minutes to give you an
update on Google. But I wanted to take this opportunity as the Chair of the Alphabet
board to share a little about me and something about my perspective about the
incredible journey that Google and Alphabet have been on.
I came to Stanford from the East Coast in 1977 with a newly minted PhD. This location
where we're standing was then a family farm. Larry and Sergey were four years old.
And the major nexus of the computing industry was somewhere between Boston
and New York. Certainly, things have changed a lot in that time. I'm a computer
scientist by background. And during the time I've been here, I cofounded 2
companies, MIPS Computer Systems and Atheros Communications, before returning
to Stanford, serving as Chair of Computer Science, Dean. And then for 16 years as
Stanford's 10th President.
I still remember the ﬁrst meeting I had with Larry and Sergey in 1997 when I was
Dean of Engineering. And they gave me a demo of what would become the Google
search engine then running at Stanford. I was absolutely astonished. I knew when I
saw it that they had redeﬁned what search meant and accomplished somethingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 12 of 24which many people probably thought was not possible, a dramatic improvement in
the quality of search results.
I remember a few years later, I brought a freshman seminar down to visit then a small
company called Google that had a few thousand employees at the time. And Larry
and Sergey came to this group of freshmen and talked about their vision of
organizing all the world's knowledge and making it useful. And I knew they had a
very big picture of what Google could be as a company.
I joined the board in 2004 and have seen some incredible transitions and big
milestones in Google's history. Of course, YouTube, Android and Chrome all
growing to have billions of users. I've seen the opportunities in mobile explode and
advertisers, publishers and partners take advantage of that change.
I was a big believer in the leadership's commitment early on to invest in machine
learning and pivoting the company around AI. I still remember a debate we had
early on whether AI would be bigger than the Internet or not, I think a debate which
is still open. But certainly, given the dramatic improvements in machine learning, one
that's very active and may someday come true.
Our board has a great collaborative atmosphere. It works well with the management
team and has a diverse set of strengths and experiences. We appointed Alan Mulally,
the former President and CEO of Ford Motor Company and the Executive Vice
President at Boeing before that, to our board in July 2014. He's brought global
business leadership as well as expertise in ﬁnancial and management.
Roger Ferguson, President and the CEO of TIAA and former member of the Board of
Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, joined our board in June of 2016. He
has a long record of distinguished service in both the public and private sectors.
Ann Mather joined our board in 2005 and has been chair of our Audit Committee
since that time. She brought tremendous ﬁnancial and accounting expertise to the
board, leveraging her experience as CFO at Pixar.
We also this -- in this past year lost 2 board members: Shirley Tilghman on her
retirement from the board. And Paul Otellini due to his early tragic death. So we are
actively looking for additional independent board members, who can complement
the existing expertise and help take Alphabet to that next level.
In searching for new board members, we take the issue of diversity seriously. A
diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures, both within Alphabet and in the tech
industry more broadly, leads to the creation of better products and services. And
that's reﬂected in the makeup of our board. Over the last 4 -- few years for open
positions on the Alphabet Board of Directors, we have consistently interviewed a
diverse set of qualiﬁed candidates and found many outstanding new board
members that way. We are committed to continuing that. And I can conﬁrm that forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06

includes both underrepresented people of color and diﬀerent genders.
As the company enters its 20th year, there's never been a more exciting time for
Google and Alphabet. It's also a time when the company must be deeply thoughtful
about its role in society and its impact on our users. Within Google, we now have 7
products that have 1 billion monthly active users: Search, Maps, Chrome, Play,
YouTube, Android and Gmail. The core ads business continues to show strong
growth. And newer businesses like Cloud, hardware and Play show great promise.
We also have great conﬁdence in Sundar's leadership and where he's taking the
company.
In our Other Bets, we believe we've developed a strategy and organization that will
allow us to innovate in diﬀerent sectors. And we see tremendous potential in the
work happening across Alphabet. As an example, Waymo recently launched a self-
driving program for early adopters in Phoenix. This milestone puts us on track to
have a commercial ridesharing service with self-driving cars in the next year. But the
Waymo team has over 6 million test miles driving in real-world situations across 25
cities and 7 states. In addition, there are billions of miles of simulation and robust
testing at our private facility. Our commitment to safety in self-driving vehicles is
absolutely paramount.
In May, Verily announced that it is joining a groundbreaking initiative sponsored by
the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's research, providing the Verily Study
Watch to help capture better biosensor data.
I'm incredibly excited by what's ahead for this company and honored to continue
working with Larry, Sergey, Sundar and the rest of the board for many years to come.
Now let me ask Sundar to come up and share some of what's happening inside
Google. Sundar?
{BIO 15004624 <GO>}
Good morning, everyone. I appreciate having all of you here. It's great to be here.
It's my pleasure.
I also want to thank John. It turns out, one of our criteria for being an Executive
Chairman is being an eminent computer scientist. Eric had obviously done
pioneering work. And I'm glad to have John at the helm of our board. John recently
won the prestigious Turing award. It is the highest award you can get in computer
science. If you're looking for a summer beach read, I would recommend Computer
Architecture: A Quantitative Approach. I remember struggling through it in college.
And we're very, very lucky to have you here, John.
I've always felt we are fortunate as a company to have a timeless mission that feels as
relevant today as when Google started when Larry and Sergey started the companyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 14 of 24and wrote this mission statement. And if anything, it is something we feel we can do
better today, thanks to the progress we are seeing with machine learning and AI.
And that's what the company is focused on and we've been hard at work.
Let me give you a couple of examples.
Google Assistant is one of the best ways by which we're using machine learning to
make progress against our core mission. We want Google to be there when users
need it. We want it to be naturally conversational. We want you to be able to ask
questions to Google. Hi. Google. And ask Google to help you with something. And
we want to make it very, very easy for you to do so. Google Assistant has made a lot
of progress. It's currently available in 10 languages. And by the end of this year, it's
going to be available in over 30 languages, serving over 95% of where Android
phones are used today. We have enabled it to work with over 5,000 devices. And it
supports 1 million actions. So if you want it to remember -- remind you to buy milk
when you reach the grocery store or call a Lyft or Uber, we can make those things
happen seamlessly.
Another area which is really important to us as a company is Google News. News is
foundational to how democracies work. And we want to make sure we really support
high-quality journalism. It's more important than ever before. So we recently
launched a brand-new Google News product, which uses AI to really personalize
and bring the best of what high-quality journalism has to oﬀer. It's really intuitive to
use. And we've used machine learning to really oﬀer deep perspective on news and
personalize it to users everywhere.
Another area, which is making tremendous progress, which is very, very popular with
our users is YouTube. YouTube is now used by over 1.8 billion users. We are really
expanding the experience that YouTube oﬀers. And it's become a great product for
content creators to build communities, earn a living and reach users everywhere.
Recently, we made big strides with the product. We launched YouTube Live. And
today, we are really investing in new experiences that bring live content to our users.
Coachella was a big example. BeyoncÃ© wowed Coachella and used YouTube to
reach over 41 million users through the live stream product.
Just this month, we launched YouTube Music. It not just oﬀers you oﬃcial versions of
songs, like you ﬁnd everywhere else. But it oﬀers YouTube's unique catalog of
remixes, covers, live versions and music videos. And more importantly, it uses
machine learning again to deliver the right music for the right moment in a very
personalized manner.
One of the things I'm really proud about YouTube is that every single day, we get
over 1 billion views of educational content on YouTube. Recently, there was a
#YouTubeTaughtMe, which appeared organically by our users. And there were
inspiring examples of how YouTube helped someone launch their music career,
learned cooking, learned calculus and the examples are endless.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 15 of 24Another area where we are investing as a company is in our hardware products. We
are using AI in combination with software and hardware to deliver unique
experiences for our users. The best example of it last year was a very popular
product, Google Home and Google Home Mini. And towards the end of last year, we
sold greater than 1 Google Home every second. And our Net Promoter Scores for
these products are best of class in the industry.
We also welcomed Nest to our portfolio of products at Google to supercharge our
eﬀorts here. And so far, we have sold more than 11 million Nest products. And in 2017,
we sold more Nest products than the previous two years combined. So we're really
excited on the progress we are making across the suite of our hardware products.
And we plan to invest more here.
An area which we are seeing tremendous momentum is Google Cloud. This is the
collection of our oﬀerings for our enterprise customers. Towards the end of last year,
last quarter of 2017, we passed $1 billion per quarter in revenue. And we are
expanding Google Cloud in many, many regions around the world. We recently
announced regions in Japan, Finland, Hong Kong and Latin America. We are also
signing signiﬁcantly larger, more strategic deals with Google Cloud. Recently signed
deals include Airbus, StubHub, Shopify, Verizon, Kohl's, Kroger and PayPal. This
reﬂects that we are working with customers to solve their deep business problems
and help them achieve their strategic goals. Our security capabilities, easy-to-use
advanced data analytics and machine learning solutions and the secure and leading
collaboration platform, G Suite, are winning customers over.
Talking about G Suite, G Suite has reached an inﬂection point and is serving both
enterprise and consumers well at scale. We recently launched an entirely redesigned
version of Gmail. Hopefully, you're all using it. It's gotten great reception.
And as part of that, I want to highlight a simple example where we use machine
learning to make a day-to-day user experience much, much better. It's called Smart
Compose. So as you start typing an email, we automatically, understanding the
context, oﬀer suggestions and make it much easier for you to complete your actions.
As part of us approaching all our products, we take our responsibility very, very
seriously. Technology can be a tremendously positive force. But it also raises
important questions about how we should apply it in the world. We are asking
ourselves all those questions, listening to our users and thinking deeply about how
to get this right. We take this responsibility very seriously.
As an example, I spoke about Google Cloud and our data centers. Google is deeply
committed to sustainability and ensuring we have a positive impact on the
environment. In 2010, we began buying renewable energy at scale. Today, we are the
largest corporate renewable energy purchaser in the world. Google purchased 100%
renewable energy in 2017 to match consumption for global operations, including
both our data centers and oﬃces. To date, Google's renewable energy projects haveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06

globally.
We are also committed to helping create economic opportunities for everyone. Our
commitment is rooted in our belief that technology can play a signiﬁcant role in
improving lives and closing gaps. So I'm really proud of 3 big announcements we
made recently. We announced Grow With Google, a new initiative to help people
get the skills they need to get a job or grow their business. We announced over $1
billion in google.org grants and programs over ﬁve years to nonproﬁts around the
world. And we committed 1 million employee hours that Googlers can volunteer to
nonproﬁts over the next ﬁve years.
Last week, we also released our economic impact report that shows in the U.S., our
search and advertising tools generated over $283 billion in economic activity. And
that more than 1.5 million businesses, website publishers and nonproﬁts nationwide
beneﬁted from using Google search and advertising tools. Behind these reports are
millions of individual stories about how people are using Google to grow their
business and transform their communities.
Before I hand it back to John, I want to end by sharing one of the stories that really
touched me. I met Scott Baker last fall in Pittsburgh. And I've remembered his story
since. Let's take a look.

Questions And Answers
{BIO 1433018 <GO>}
I'd now like to ask several of our management team to come up: Ruth Porat, our
CFO; David Drummond, Senior Vice President; Kent Walker, Chief Counsel; Sundar,
of course; and Eileen Naughton, our SVP of People Operations. And we'll now open
the ﬂoor for questions. We have about 20 minutes. We have microphones there.
Could I please ask everybody one question. So we can get through as many people
who have questions. And let's try to focus on questions rather than speeches. Shall
we start on the left?
My name is (Eric Sprague). I'm a stockholder from the Sacramento area. And Sundar,
you showed the Smart Compose in Gmail from machine learning. But I was
wondering in search, I think it's fair to say that since machine learning keeps spam
out of Gmail, you use it in search to keep spam out. But how do you use it to
separate the good results from the great results?

A - Kent WalkerOne of the areas where we use machine learning the most is actually search. The way
we rank our search results, it's like ﬁnding a needle in a haystack. Every single day,
over 15% of our queries is something we have never seen before. So to try and ﬁnd
the right web results for that, obviously, we put a lot of work into it. And over the past
few years, we've added something called RankBrain, which is based on machine
learning. And we actually use it as part of our approach to ﬁnd the best web results.
So it's deeply ingrained in how search works now. And it's a big reason why our
search quality remains ahead of everyone else.
So that's more for new search phrases. But how about for existing search phrases?
{BIO 15004624 <GO>}
No. It works across the board, particularly I used the fact that we get so many new
queries. It's a fact that we can't rely on the work we have done before. And every
single day, we have to make sure we get our results right. And that's why machine
learning really plays a part.

Good morning, Mr. Chairman, fellow shareholders. I'm John Simpson. I am an
Alphabet shareholder and now after the recent split have 4 shares. And I appreciate
the growth in my investment. I'm also Consumer Watchdog's Technology and Privacy
Project Director. And my question is about Google's largest unit -- Alphabet's largest
unit, Google. And the California Privacy Act, which are going to be on a ballot in
November. They would establish the right to know what information is being
gathered about you by various businesses, gives you the ability to tell companies to
stop selling your personal information data and empowers you to hold companies
accountable for data breaches and breaking the law. Google was one of 5
companies to contribute $200,000 to oppose the measure even before the ballot
initiative has formally qualiﬁed. Two companies, Facebook and Verizon, have
dropped their opposition. Now since Google says it does not even sell data about
you, why is the company opposing this privacy protecting ballot initiative? Would
you consider dropping your opposition?
{BIO 1433018 <GO>}
Kent, would you like to respond?
{BIO 15242895 <GO>}
Sure. Thank you, John. Good to see you again. As you know, we have long been one
of the leading companies when it comes to privacy and security of user data. We've
just gone through a very extensive 2-year long eﬀort with regard to compliance with
the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe. And we're bringing many of those
protections to users worldwide. As you say, we don't sell user data. And we are in
great pains to make sure that people have great control and notice over their data.
We're not opposed to regulation. We are in favor of smart regulation. We have
noticed there are a number of companies in California, not just in the Internet sector
but across the board, have raised concerns that this particular ballot measure may beFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06

have raised some concerns. But we do continue to engage with regulators,

these issues.
{BIO 19018676 <GO>}
I believe that this could perhaps be addressed legislatively before it goes on the

perhaps come up with acceptable language?

Of course, I don't want to go into private conversations. But we're always happy to
talk to people both on the legislative side and the regulatory side of all these issues.
{BIO 1433018 <GO>}
Thank you.
I was here many years ago. And the surprising beneﬁt to me was having the
employees demonstrate products and be able to ask them questions and give
feedback. So I'm really disappointed that, that's not here anymore. And I was going
to ask you, I'm a frequent user of your products every day. I, unfortunately, ﬁnd errors
and things that could be improved frequently. So I can search for an email
somewhere, send it in, maybe I'll get a response, maybe they'll ﬁx something. But
there's really something about actually face to face with another human being or
even a telephone, which you don't oﬀer. And for example, how about having a half a
day, once a year in Mountain View and having these product demos, having talks
about how to use the products, getting feedback from users as a group, for example.
And having other methods besides just email, which is very impersonal many times
and very faceless and lacking, in my opinion.
{BIO 15004624 <GO>}
Well thank you for the suggestion. I mean, when we build consumer products,
nothing matters more to us than getting feedback from our consumers. So today, we
actually have -- every year, through the course of the year in all our locations around
the world, we invite consumers in to do product testing and feedback sessions. And
so it's a standard part of the process we do today. And hopefully, you can participate
in one of those sessions. And so -- but we do it consistently. Any time we build a
product, we do focus groups, we test the product, we observe how users are using it
and then ask them to rate and give feedback. And it's a standard part of how we
build up our products. But I appreciate your suggestion. And we'll look to address it
here, too.
So there's no plans, let's say, to have phone support or a feedback solicitation, for
example?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06

We do surveys as part of building our products. And we deﬁnitely do oﬀer phone
support for many of our products. So for example, if you're a customer of G Suite, for
sure, we oﬀer you phone support. Or if you buy a Google Pixel phone, you can call
Google. And so we do support. Our advertising products have the same features as
well. So we do it for a number of our products today.
Good morning. My name is (Tobias) and I'm actually here representing one of your
German shareholders today, the Long-Term Investment Corporation, or (inaudible).
Thanks for taking my question. My question is about -- also about machine learning
and AI. We've heard a lot about that today. The company's talked about this for a
long time. And Sergey has also written about its importance in the shareholder letter.
And I also have seen some of the very interesting demos you did, Sundar, at the
recent I/O conference. And so it's clear to me that the company is a leader in this
ﬁeld. And I just wonder what the source of this leadership is, how we got here.
Sundar, do you think you have a -- there's a structural advantage that Alphabet has
maybe because of its Search business? Or did you just see the opportunity sooner
and started earlier than other companies? Or do you just put more resources onto
this project? Maybe you can elaborate a little bit about that.
{BIO 15004624 <GO>}
Look, I mean, it goes back to the foundation of how the company started. And John
covered it a bit. And Larry and Sergey always took the view that if you apply deep
computer science to solve user problems, you can do it really well. And if you take a
long-term view and you approach moon shots, you can make signiﬁcant progress.
And till today, we make sure as a company whenever we look at a problem to solve,
we look for the technical insight behind solving the problem and how we can apply
computer science. So that culture over time has meant that we've been able to
attract the best computer scientists from around the world. And as that ﬁeld has
progressed because of the people we have, we had early insights into the power
and potential of machine learning. And we realized it is going to be a point of
inﬂection. And it's something we have -- make sure we are going to invest
signiﬁcantly for the long term but apply it thoughtfully towards solving problems for
users. And so I think that foundation is what helps us do these things. But we have to
earn it every year and we'll continue doing so.

workers of the company are Latino or black. By contrast, large number of its food
service workers, janitors, shuttle drivers and security oﬃcers are people of color
facing wages so low that they struggle to live in Silicon Valley. As Google plans to

Today, San Jose is one of the most diverse cities in the nation. But that diversity is
threatened by extreme rent increases and displacement likely to follow Google

the company also make a commitment to ensure its plans for a Google campus do
not damage the diversity of San Jose by displacing people of color and women-

company to have representation of blacks and Hispanics in the U.S.. And an
improvement in representation of women reach market supply by 2020. And Sundar
has put that objective out to the entire company. And we are working hard against
both hiring. But also progression and development of talent and retention of talent.
So that is a ﬁrm leadership commitment inside. As far as San Jose, I think -- Kent?
{BIO 15242895 <GO>}
Sure. Yes. We're committed to make this a great thing not just for Google. But for San
Jose and all its citizens. So we're working very closely with the city government there.
The location is at the Diridon transit hub to make it easy for workers to come in from
all parts of the Bay Area, not just San Jose. But we're also exploring possibilities of
working on housing initiatives and other kinds of things that could address various
impacts. Again, we want this to be a strong positive for everybody involved.
Do we hear a commitment from you guys to enter into community beneﬁts
agreement to make sure that people do not get displaced?
{BIO 15242895 <GO>}
There are a lot of components to that. So I don't want to enter into a commitment
sitting here today without sitting around the table with the right people, from the San
Jose city government and from the various constituent groups that are there. But
we're already pretty actively involved in a number of diﬀerent conversations here. So

Good afternoon. Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the board, members of the
executive team. My name is Jeﬀrey Buchanan. I'm here representing Silicon Valley
Rising, a community labor coalition in the city of San Jose. Across the Bay Area, as
Google and tech giants have grown, we've seen an inﬂux of high wage jobs leading
to skyrocketing rents and home prices. As the housing crisis continues, the public is
beginning to blame companies like Google for their role in gentriﬁcation and
displacement. It seems that inaction by the company could create new risks for
Google's brand, for its eﬀorts to recruit and sustain its workforce by being identiﬁed
with the Bay Area's biggest sustainability problem instead of the necessary solutions.
I think that it's such a visible problem. We, as shareholders, as we drove to the
meeting today were greeted by an RV sitting parked out right in front of the parking
lot we were directed to go to. If you look across Mountain View, certainly, there
continues to be this very visible sign of the increase in homelessness and the
number of RVs that crowd the streets. In San Jose, as mentioned earlier, Google is
planning a 20,000 worker campus. And we hope that there's a chance to do things
diﬀerently for Google as a company here with this. Certainly, Facebook and its
expansion in Menlo Park was able to enter into a community beneﬁts agreement,
working with community stakeholders, working with communities of color and also
avoiding unnecessary legal confrontations with that group as that development
proceeded. Do you believe that displacement in the housing crisis presents a brandFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06

as your colleagues at Google (sic) (Facebook) were able to do at Menlo Park.
{BIO 15242895 <GO>}
We appreciate the spirit of this question. And it's very similar to the prior question.
Honestly, we don't think of it so much as a brand risk because we're making sure
we're doing the right thing on this. And we are, as I said, actively engaged with a lot
of diﬀerent groups and with the city government to make sure we get to a good
outcome. A lot of the work we're already doing with regard to our buses and shuttle
services are designed to reduce congestion for workers getting to campuses. We
want it to be a collaborative process. And we very much don't want to be an
adversarial structure. We're moving forward -- it's still early in the process. But I think
we are making good progress on that.
Good morning. I would like to say thank you. I came two years ago, I was upset. I
thought that you're being criticized for not sticking to search. Now I see that you
have built search, expanded search and are moving right along. And I'm so glad you
didn't listen to critics who said stick to your (muttons). No. That was good. Also, I said

Certainly. We're very excited about the opportunity with Waymo. And as John said in
his opening comments, it really starts with the eﬀorts that we put in over many years
to address safety, safety ﬁrst, second, third. And that creates this extraordinary
opportunity. There are over 1 million people who die on the road every year. And the
opportunity to actually make a diﬀerence there and save lives is what motivates our
engineers. In addition, we have the opportunity to transform cities. You don't have to
put valuable resources into parking garages. It can go into education or playgrounds
or other places. So we look at this and say it's an extraordinary place for us to put our
attention. And very much to your question, the ﬁrst place we're looking, as John said,
is that ridesharing service. And we have our pilot in Phoenix. And we're very excited
about how that's going and the next step of that. We do have people in Phoenix who
are riding in our self-driving cars now. And then it goes to a commercial opportunity.
{BIO 1952796 <GO>}
No one in the front.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
With no one in the front seat, yes. And we've talked about a number of other
opportunities, whether it's logistics or last mile, helping cities deal with what
happens after people get oﬀ public transit. That last mile problem is a big one as
well as licensing the technology. So in our view, when you have this gem at the core,
namely a solution to safety, it opens up a host of diﬀerent opportunities. And that's
what we're looking to continue to develop. We are working with a number of
partners. As you've seen in the press, our cars, we struck a deal with FCA to have an
option to buy a whole number of cars as well as Jaguar. And we're continuing to
work across the ecosystem.
So compared to like other competitor, like safety is like a primary issue for the
Alphabet right now?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Safety should be a primary issue for everyone. It's about keeping the roads safe and
saving lives. And so we're really proud of what our team has done and have
published quite a bit on that. You can see the safety reports that really distinguish
how we've done relative to the opportunity out there.

Hi.
I have a couple of thoughts. One is talking about can you partner with the
Parkinson's Institute while you're at it in dealing with tremor? And the other thing is,
if -- I noticed that the Salesforce tower, part of it has housing. Now this is kind of silly
maybe. But I'm not sure, how about some housing above the buildings that you're
going to build in San Jose. So that workers in those buildings have ﬁrst choice to live
where they work, thus decreasing the traﬃc on the roads and then again doing some
more things about maybe paying people who are the janitors and the bus drivers
and the other support staﬀ, pay them at a higher wage so that they can live. You can
be a good example in that. And I'm just asking you to consider doing those things.
{BIO 1433018 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you. Well I think those are all good suggestions. I think we all agree that if
the Bay Area is going to continue to be the center of technical excellence and
creativity, we're going to have to solve our problems of housing and transportation.
And it's going to require governments working with institutions and companies to
solve that. And that's the only way we'll solve it. But if we're not committed to it,
somebody will eventually replace the Bay Area as the next major center of
innovation. And it will be a shame on all of us.
Thank you, all, for joining us at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The
meeting is now adjourned.
