Good morning and welcome to the Bloomberg Intelligence Webinar to discuss the
impact of Coronavirus and scenarios for Tech, Media, and Telecom sectors. My name
is Mandeep Singh, team lead for tech team here and senior analyst covering online
travel, ride sharing and software sectors. Just wanted to start oﬀ by saying our
thoughts go out to the people who have been aﬀected by this challenging situation
and we hope it's over soon.
A couple of housekeeping items. The webinar will be recorded and available for
replay later. Views expressed by the analysts are their own and I encourage
everybody to send their questions in real-time which our analysts will take at the end.
So without further ado, over to Anand who will start with semis and hardware.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Thank you, Mandeep. Good morning, everyone, at least to those who like volatility.
I'm the senior analyst covering semis and hardware, and we've spent extensive time
conducting sensitivity scenarios amid the fast changing COVID-19 situation. With the
17 or so companies under my coverage, we have drastically reduced sales and EPS
scenarios and compared them to consensus which have hardly moved. We're only
highlighting a few today. We've also factored in margin hits due to under-utilization
and what's reﬂected in the BI scenario is certainly not the optimistic scenario, but
certainly not the dooms day one either.
It reﬂects weak 1Q and 2Q, some strength in 3Q and sort of a normal-ish 4Q. From an
end-market perspective, we think that the cloud, public cloud, speciﬁcally, will be the
strongest area, and on a relative basis, the least impacted area due to Coronavirus.
Corporate IT, we think, which is already weak coming into 2020, which will weaken
further in our estimate. We see no hope for auto units, and most companies were
looking for auto units to remain ﬂat in 2020 after sort of minus mid-singles in 2019.
We don't think that's going to occur. And handsets, which are a good 20-plusFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 2 of 18percent of semi consumption, will remain a mixed bag. The critical period is 3Q and
it's a 4G, 5G ﬁght, and on a relative basis, it's the units versus ASP ﬁght with stronger
ASPs or average selling prices for 5G versus certainly en mass units for 4G.
With that as the background. I thought we would address some of the takeaways at
the subsector level and at the company level. The key number one point that we
want to make is semis are unequivocally much, much better position than hardware,
better exposure to the public cloud companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel all
beneﬁt here given that the data centers are disproportionately tweaked towards the
public cloud over corporate IT. But we have to consider the oﬀsets both in the
consumer PC side of the business as well as in corporate IT. We think that from a
background perspective, second half is better than ﬁrst half, but again remember
that the cloud -- public cloud come back which tends to be binge in its spending
was meant to have a counter-seasonal eﬀect this year with one half sales being
greater than two half sales at least according to Intel. We think that will no longer
hold true and we think it will tend to be a traditional year, but then there will be this
balance between corporate cloud and non-corporate cloud.
(inaudible) utilization, we think that this is sort of a slightly ignored topic. For
companies that do own their fans, after 2019, we were coming into a year that 2020
was going to posit better volumes, and that was going to ﬁll up the farms and most
companies have posited stronger gross margins as a result of better utilization,
better mix et cetera compared to 2019. We think that that view will have some
serious risk, so even a small change in sales relative to last year or relative to
estimates, will have a notable impact because of under-utilization charges. With that
as background, we thought we just share a few companies. Again, this is just two or
three of the companies that were positing relative to the 10 to 20 that each of us
covers, and if you look at TI, for example, we have taken down the BI scenario
suggested that sales is lower than consensus by 3%, the EPS impact is substantially
more higher percent and there has been very, very little move on part of consensus
with these numbers.
So, we are very focused on earnings power and -- even with a company that is
disproportionately exposed to Industrials and autos such as TI, we think that there
will be a bigger impact because this is a relatively slow-moving sector. Qualcomm,
again, same story, but the 4G and 5G mix that I mentioned earlier, will have a
dramatic impact, 5G units and ASPs alone cannot oﬀset the 4G unit impact and IoT
and/or autos will have again a weakening inﬂuence, will be dilutive to this eﬀort.
So, EPS is lower substantially more than our sales cut relative to consensus. AMB
price to superior execution, higher multiple here exposed to all the right areas, but
again phenomenal execution relative to Intel, but again, this is a high multiple name
and it will have an impact as much as we believe that it might not, same logistics
issues as the rest of the industry.
I want to switch gears here and turn it over to my colleague Woo Jin Ho who covers
SMid semiconductor names.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17

{BIO 15225630 <GO>}
Anand, thank you very much, and good morning everyone. Like Anand said, I cover
the SMid semiconductor names as well as networking. So we did a similar exercise
on earnings for small cap and the chip makers. As many in the audience may know,
the impacts from the virus continue to evolve rapidly, several of the companies have
already pre-announced, Qorvo, Skyworks, Microchip and ON Semi, to name a few.
On average, these companies have cut estimates by 4% to 6% for the ﬁrst quarter
and did not update for 2Q, given the uncertainty. But let's take a closer look what's
embedded into the 1Q cuts and to say that these may already be outdated given
what's happened over the last couple of days.
So what's included, one, supply chain disruptions in China; two, lower demand in
China, and stable -- but stable demand in the US and Europe. Needless to say, these
are already outdated given the global disruptions from COVID-19. So what we take --
we took a stab at estimate scenarios late last week for the small and mid cap semi
companies, we modestly took down 2Q estimates from recent consensus cuts and
made modest cuts in 2H. Broadly speaking, our assumptions of the business
environment was a stabilizing 2Q and that yielded a 5% drop in sales and consensus
expectations -- versus consensus expectations and a 10% drop in EPS versus
expectations, and our assumptions, like Anand said, also included modest
reductions in gross margin and OpEx.
But given the events over the past couple of days, the breadth and scope of the virus
impact, there is still risk that 2Q can come down further than the 5% drop that we're
looking for as well and the 10% drop in EPS that we're looking for. We do think that
consensus has not yet caught up and we think that the second half recovery may be
weaker than anticipated. With that in mind, given the uncertainty, we did take a look
at the strength of balance sheets of our small and mid cap chip makers. Within our
coverage universe, all of our companies have a fair amount of free cash ﬂow
generation and most of our companies have manageable balance sheets with low
leverage ratios.
Some of the companies are just Skyworks, Maxim and Xilinx, and Qorvo are very
cash rich, were those with some debt, leverage ratios although at 1 times to 2 times
EBITDA and free cash margins with over 30%, so these companies should have little
impact, you see little impact in servicing their debt and paying their dividends.
With that, I'm going to pass it back to Anand to discuss hardware.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Thank you, Woo Jin. So hardware is a slightly diﬀerent scenario than semiconductors.
We are particularly focused on earnings power, not multiples. We believe that the
hardware sector, the OEM space is dramatically more poorly positioned than
semiconductors for multiple reasons.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 4 of 18Woo Jin HoNumber one focus on earnings not multiples, while HPE and Dell sub-5 times, HPQ
is sub-6 times, Dell -- and NetApp is 9 times, Cisco at 10 times these appear low
versus historical levels. But again, we believe that earnings are at substantial risk here
more so than the semiconductor sector.
Sales revisions are low for 2020 and even 2021, we've taken look at that for Giggles
from consensus and we think there are notable cuts potentially to come. We think
that earnings are set to structurally decline and we think that corporate IT spending,
which was weak coming into 2020 from the hardware OEM perspective, if you look
at several businesses both from from HPE, from Lenovo, from NetApp, from Dell, all
of those structural weaknesses we think will continue, and this was even before
COVID-19. We think that COVID-19 will only amplify the structural weakness and
these companies have very little places to hide given their de minimis public cloud
exposure.
So using that as background, we thought we'd share sort of an HPE scenario, and if
you look at the revenue cards, we have taken it down by 2% relative to, we are now
2% lower than consensus, we have taken it down notably, but if you look at the EPS
perspective, we are substantially lower than consensus by about 17%. We think that
there is also no scope for an imminent recovery in the short term, just as an example.
Now I want to turn it over to back to Woo Jin to discuss Cisco. Woo Jin?
{BIO 15225630 <GO>}
Sure. Thanks Anand. So, a couple of things that I want to discuss, on the high level
view I want to start on networking. So networking companies have little China sales
exposure. So the demand side impact in the region should have little impact on
sales, but the weakness in the US and Europe is a concern for us. There has been
supply chain impact for the networkers, they do source and also manufacturer from
the regions and the early impact we've seen is a 4% to 6% sales impact for the March
quarter. Now as I only kick things oﬀ with the high level view, companies with
broader base than large enterprise corporate IT exposure are most at risk and within
our coverage universe, Cisco has 60% sales exposure to the enterprise. Now,
consensus have yet to take down the numbers and it's unclear to us what that impact
may be, so we took a look back at the 2008-2009 ﬁnancial crisis, consensus took
down ﬁscal 2009 sales by 19% peak to trough to reﬂect the impact of the ﬁnancial
crisis and this is how I'm thinking about it for now.
But if we take a step back and take a bigger picture view on the networking space,
not all networkers will be impacted as severely, companies with customer exposure
with recurring sales -- recurring with -- the recurring sales positive secular trends and
earmarked CapEx budgets are likely best positioned to weather the storm.
Companies in this group include Arista Networks, they're exposed to -- high
exposure to public cloud. Motorola Solutions, high exposure to critical
communications and public safety networks for ﬁrst responders -- responders and
Ciena and Ericsson, which is exposed to the rollout of 5G networks which shouldn'tFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17

quarantined.
That's it from me. From here, I'm going to pass it over to Geetha Ranganathan who
will overview the media space. Geetha?
{BIO 15007716 <GO>}
Thank you, Woo Jin. So hello everybody. My name is Geetha Ranganathan, I cover
the media sector here at Bloomberg Intelligence along with my colleague Amine
Bensaid. So it's no secret that the media industry has been hit hard by this pandemic.
The crisis really couldn't have come at a worse time because we've seen traditional
media already been facing some of its worst challenges in terms of severe pressures
on the legacy business added to which they were kind of in the midst of making this
pivot to streaming and then you had the virus hit, so the media sector is actually
down about 35% to 40% year-to-date in terms of stock price performance. It was
down about 15% before the virus hit us, but in terms of exposure, the ones that are
most exposed to the threat are those that generate signiﬁcant shares of their
revenue from theme parks, the box oﬃce advertising, all of which are threatened not
just by the virus outbreak but as well by a broader economic downturn.
So I'm going to start oﬀ with the box oﬃce and kind of look at it in terms of diﬀerent
sector-by-sector impact. So for the box oﬃce, my colleague, Amine Bensaid, has
done a lot of work on this sector in trying to ﬁgure out how much of an impact
diﬀerent moving parts are going to have on the business as a whole. So you have
theater closures going on, you have movie delays and then the latest move
yesterday was one from Universal which decided to take its movie trolls directly to
the streaming platform.
So to begin with, I mean just to kind of give you a little bit of background, 2020 was
going to be a challenging year, even without the virus, just because of a somewhat
weaker slate. But obviously now those concerns are ampliﬁed manifold, Amine
expects that in a base case scenario, the global box oﬃce industry may lose upwards
of about 20% in terms of box oﬃce receipts as theater closures hit Europe and North
America. So in terms of what that means for box oﬃce, it's about an $8 billion to $10
billion impact. So that's about 20% impact for a $40 billion industry. But I think the
bigger concern is really the longer-term threats. So you have studios kind of
postponing their releases. Of course, the greatest challenge I think is what I just
mentioned, with studios kind of trying to release titles directly to streaming.
So the bigger concern there is, is that going to potentially shift consumer behavior.
And then just to kind of take a look at what this means to the diﬀerent theater chains,
it's a little hard to ascertain right now, but it Amine's done some work here again.
Again, this is changing as we speak as there are more and more theater closures, but
we think sales could be hit about 10% or more this year. And I think the bigger
question for these theater operators is it kind of really then questions their ability to
pay near-term ﬁxed cost obligations. So we are going to be soon publishing a noteFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 6 of 18that goes over all of these obligations and who is best positioned to survive the
Coronavirus, please stay tuned for that.
I'm going to go back now to some of the other sectors, obviously theme parks,
again, we had the announcement both from Disney and Comcast Universal business.
So this, the theme park business has obviously been a consistent performer for both
of these companies, but with all parks closed, we think Disney now loses about $65
million or so in revenue per day. So that's $50 million from its domestic parks, about
$15 million from overseas. So closure for a month basically translates into about $2
billion of lost revenue, about $700 million to $800 million in EBIT on a monthly level.
For the Universal Parks, they have two in the US, one in Japan. Those roughly bring in
about $16 million or $17 million in revenue on a daily basis, about $6 million in daily
EBITDA. So that's kind of the impact that we have gauged so far.
Then moving on to advertising, now this is again a really challenged sector, it's kind
of changing dramatically. A lot of it is going to depend on whether we believe
COVID-19 triggers a recession because if it does, then of course, advertising is going
to be hurt very, very badly. So I'm going to -- obviously, again, the situation is
extremely ﬂuid here, but I'm actually going to go with some of Magna Global's
projections, they actually did a little bit of analysis last week. And as of last week,
they were actually still projecting a 2% to 3% increase in core US advertising, that
excludes the political and the Olympics events, but remember that that percentage
increase does not factor in a recession.
The problem is that with travel, tourism, retail, restaurants and movies having been
hit as badly as they have been, a rebound is going to be extremely challenging, and
so we think that those estimates are going to have to come down. Political is -- might
be one of the bright spots. This was projected to be a record year for political
advertising, close to almost $3.5 billion, and so that's pretty much intact so far, but if
the Olympics are canceled, that's going to be about $1 billion to $1.5 billion lost in
terms of advertising revenue, and of course, again, a severe plunge for TV ratings for
the NBC Network. Moving more speciﬁcally to TV advertising, and I want to do a little
bit of analysis here from what the sports cancellations have meant for TV advertising,
we did a little bit of work here in terms of assessing exactly what the breakdown is
from a network level and for -- and we project that the suspension of the NBA and
the cancellation of the NCAA tournament will result in about $2 billion of lost
revenue.
So for NBA, we expect Disney's exposure to be close to almost $700 million just from
the playoﬀs and the remainder of the regular season. Turner probably has closer to
about $350 million, $360 million exposure. For the NCAA, we expect -- so that was
supposed to be on both the Turner and the CBS network, but Turner would actually
take a worst hit this year than CBS because they had coverage of the semiﬁnals and
the ﬁnals.
So that's in terms of an ad revenue impact. In terms of what it does to ratings, this is
what we expect it will do to ratings, so ESPN taking about a 14% hit, Turner again
going to be, it's almost a double whammy for them with the loss of both the NBAFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 7 of 18Mandeep Singhand the NCAA. And that's why you see some of those pretty bad numbers there for
some of the Turner networks. So that's as far as what it's doing -- what the sports
cancellations are doing in terms of viewership. But on the bright side, news networks
ratings are soaring and so Magna actually expects viewership on new channels to be
up almost 10% to 15% during this time.
So the big winners in terms of quarantine and stay-at-home is actually going to be
streaming. So it's ideal for bench viewing. In terms of advertising, it really helps with
connected TV advertising, we've already seen that this sector has really been on the
rise this year. So before the virus, expectations were that connected advertising jump
about 27%, we now expect a further acceleration of 10% to 13%, so nearly 40% versus
that initial estimate.
And then lastly, just in terms of touching on the cable sector, the cable operators in
terms of pay-TV, we think that's pretty defensive, thanks mainly to their heavy
broadband exposure. So that makes it less sensitive than competitors to both the
virus as well as the potential economic downturn. Again, we are going to be doing
more in-depth work on a company-by-company level in terms of what the COVID-19
impact is going to be over the next few days. So please do stay tuned for that.
And with that, I'm going to pass it to my colleague, Mandeep Singh.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Thank you, Geetha. And just a reminder for everyone, please send your questions if
you have any, there is an option in the webinar to send questions. We'll take all of
them towards the end. So, thank you.
I think one of the things you're going to see with the COVID-19 is, obviously
companies with larger consumer exposure have been hit very hard and it's not
surprising given the implications that COVID-19 has had on travel. So I just want to
touch on the estimates and our view of where this sector is headed. So, so far, what
we have seen is about 11% to 12% decline in estimates from the beginning of the year
for online travel guys and our view is, 2Q could be a lot worse.
So we think consensus is way behind the curve in terms of taking down estimates for
both the online travel guys as well as the ride sharing companies. And the reason I
say that is because of the number of cancellations that have taken place just in the
last two weeks to three weeks. So our view is that you're going to see a pronounced
impact on 2Q. We think it could be down as much as 50% for a Booking, which has a
notable Europe exposure. Now the thing about just the huge decline we are seeing
is there will be pent-up demand and so you are going to see a short snapback if and
when it happens and most likely it won't happen before 4Q in our view. But at the
same time, a company like Booking, which has a very solid balance sheet could
really weather this much better than the other online travel guys, namely Expedia or
TripAdvisor, and so we deﬁnitely think Booking has a pretty strong balance sheet
here, and a lot of the estimate cuts are already reﬂected in the valuations. Booking
still trades at a premium relative to Expedia. But we think that premium is warranted,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 8 of 18Julie Charielland at this point of time, I think the Europe is the big headwind for Booking, and
once the travel bans are lifted, you will see a sharp snapback, so 2Q is pretty much a
done deal, we think consensus is way behind, you are going to see some very sharp
cut in estimates for 2Q, but overall, we think there will be a strong pent-up demand.
Quickly on the ride sharing side, we think trip frequency is a big driver of revenue for
the ride sharing guys and what we are seeing more and more given the isolation and
everything that we are seeing with COVID-19, just there will be a pronounced decline
when it comes to trip frequency provider and that will have implications both on the
demand side as well as the supply side for ride sharing guys. So consensus is again
behind the curve for the ride sharing guys, they are still expecting 20% growth for
the full year and we think ﬁrst half is probably going to be mid-single digits at best,
and you are going to see these companies push out there, especially I think Lyft as
well as Uber push out their proﬁtability targets by at least a couple of quarters.
I will quickly mention, Uber is somewhat better positioned than Lyft because food
delivery is seeing or should see a bump-up, I should say with more people staying at
home and we think the food delivery should be able to oﬀset whatever headwinds
Uber is seeing on the ride sharing side. So it's a good thing for Uber to have that
option. I would suggest everybody take a look at you know how the numbers are
shaping up for a seatrip.com for how things will snap back for Booking and Expedia
and same thing for Meituan in China for how things will shape up for the food
delivery guys because China obviously had this three months to four months ahead
and so the recovery will likely be sooner over there and it's best to look at the
metrics of those companies to get a sense of how this is going to play out in the US.
Just really quickly on the valuation risk, we think valuation risk is low at this point for
the ride sharing and food delivery guys given valuations have come down quite a bit
and I really think the key indicator is the trip frequency, once you see a bounce back
in trip frequency, I think it's a good set-up for these companies.
So with that, I will pass it on to Julie for payments.
{BIO 17144999 <GO>}
Thanks, Mandeep. Yeah, hi, it's Julie Chariell here. We ran some scenarios on our
FinTech payment companies and how they may be impacted by the slowdown in
spending. So I'll walk you through the methodology shortly, but let me ﬁrst give you
just the key takeaways.
First, discretionary spending is clearly heading way down and it will lead to slower
TPV and revenue growth in the ﬁrst half and likely slower EPS growth. I mean, it's
hard to cut costs meaningfully when the downturn seems likely to be short-lived. So
depending on the company in our group and the geographic and business mix,
revenue growth could slow 4 points to 14 points for the year and EPS could drop 2%
to.9%. Now, second, we think it's the merchant acquirers like Global Payments and
Fiserv as well as Square that could be at the high end of this negative range. This
now seems a bit like a lot of consensus call, but Global Payments and Fiserv haveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 9 of 18nearly two-thirds of their revenue tied to merchant card processing, and
discretionary spending on cards is likely to start slowing across the board, right,
we're moving beyond ﬂights and hotels and cruises now to all kinds of
entertainment sporting events, theaters, restaurants and retail. And this is not yet
reﬂected in guidance or any management commentary. And so while the ability to
work from home is a pretty amazing advance, I doubt it's the best way to extract
integration synergies from a mega merger and stay on plan.
And importantly, a few weeks ago, it was good for these companies that they had
little exposure to Asia, but we think that's going to turn into a negative for 2Q, if that
region is the lone grower. Asia, and particularly China seems to be at least past the
worst of the Coronavirus outbreak. People and factories are starting to get back to
work. Conversely, the shutdowns have just started in Europe and the US and
obviously Coronavirus cases have not yet reached a peak. So this possible Asia
rebound could be a mitigating factor for the earnings pressure on Visa and
Mastercard, because they have nearly 30% of their revenue from Asia,
And third, stocks will continue to fall until earnings estimates are reasonably adjusted
downward. So far, the weighted average reduction to 2020 EPS for our coverage
universe year-to-date is just 1.5%. We can see further share losses in the low-to-high
single digit range as estimates come down, but if bear market sentiment really
prevails and we start seeing greater multiple contraction even after factoring in the
second half recovery and 2021 growth, stock price declines will reach the mid-to-
high teens.
Lastly, we think PayPal maybe the best relative performer, its cross-border business
has already been impacted and the company announced a small growth shortfall,
we expect that to get worse for this 25% of revenue, but with social distancing, it
seems even more people are buying from online merchants and that's PayPal's core
customer base. So as long as product remains available and deliveries can continue,
PayPal's merchant customers maybe the busiest by far.
Now let me show you some of the assumptions behind our numbers. We have three
scenarios. The ﬁrst two deal with fundamentals and focused on TPV by region and
the impact on the discretionary portion of TPV. TPV is total payment volume, which is
the total amount spent on cards or other digital means. Our base case seemed like
the worst case a week ago, but now it may be light, it assumes 20% to 30% TPV
declines for just a couple of months. Scenario two assumes a deeper decline for
longer, so we have a 50% decline in discretionary spending on cards and then we
assume that lasts through June in the US and Europe.
Our third scenario or our worst case looks at the market slipping into extended bear
territory possibly from the prolonged impact and just a lack of optimism about a
swift or substantial rebound. It assumes multiple compression on lower 2021 EPS.
The speciﬁcs are described here on the slide, so I won't restate them, but the impact
on the stocks would be tough. So it's further 13% to 20% decline.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 10 of 18Jitendra WaralLet me show you the impact of these assumptions on our numbers here. As you can
see along the left side, we split our coverage into four segments. So the card
processors, these are the large merchant acquirers who merged from six companies
to three companies last year. Here you can see that in terms of revenue growth
slowdown and EPS decline, Global Payments and Fiserv have had the most
downside risk along with Square. These are for reasons I discussed earlier.
Interesting, Fidelity National or FIS, is less impacted because it has just half the
exposure to merchant card processing. The card networks, Visa and Mastercard,
have similar TPV risk as the processors, and they could also see some card issuing
and services revenue slowdown in a bank derisking kind of scenario. But their
impacts could be muted by their scale and by their global reach and that includes
more exposure to Asia, which seems to be on the mend. Wex and FleetCor have
20% to 30% of their businesses tied to corporate travel and expensing, and we all
know that is practically grounded to a halt. But their estimates have already come
down more than average and their larger exposure to trucking may actually be
supported by a rise in logistics needs, lower fuel prices though could add some top
line pressure here.
And lastly, on the pure FinTechs, Square and PayPal, Square has small merchant base
comprised of many restaurants, could be hit the hardest by a long downturn and
with virtually no exposure to Asia, there is no potential growth leg in 2Q. PayPal, as
we can see, has the lowest potential growth and EPS impact and if we're right that
that impact is conﬁned to just around that 25% of business supporting cross-border
payments, this company looks relatively well insulated. And lastly, the valuation look
on these companies. The potential stock impact really from lower EPS, if the
multiples hold, the downside is mostly contained to single-digit percentages, and
again, it's for the highest -- highest numbers are for the processors, the lowest for
PayPal.
But again, if that bear market sentiment takes hold and broader market multiples
begin to contract, even as investors are looking toward a more normalized 2021, the
shares can face another big drop.
So with that, I'm going to hand it oﬀ to my colleague, Jitendra Waral, on Internet.
{BIO 15423976 <GO>}
Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everybody. I'm Jitendra Waral, I cover the Internet
sector. The uncertainty in the space has been very high, in fact, Sheryl Sandberg,
COO of Facebook, yesterday on Bloomberg TV said, nobody can predict the
marketing impact at this point in terms of what the extent of the impact will be. So
what we will do is take some cues oﬀ what happened in China exactly and what sort
of like it means for the Internet space in general, because there are some positives
here and there are some negatives here.
On a ﬁrst touch on advertising, now this is a sector which will have a widespread
impact from all the other verticals that everybody talked about. Expectations forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17

Page 11 of 18Internet have not changed at all and that sort of reﬂects the visibility problem, but in
China, the Internet space has seen double-digit declines in its 1Q expectations. We
expect a similar thing to happen in 2Q for the US name. So there are multiple -- there
are three basic ways where the impact will really come from. Number one is travel,
travel is hard hit, hardest hit sector over here, it's 8% of the industry in general. But
the exposure varies by company. So Google has a higher exposure for search, it's
about 11%, for display, which would reﬂect Facebook, it's about 6%. So travel, we are
seeing some of the companies are taking down their spending by 25% plus in the
travel segment and that would have a ripple impact on these companies.
The aspect, which is not really captured in expectations or valuations for that matter,
is the impact from automotive and ﬁnancial services, each of it are over 12% of
industry sales. So when you sort of add up these three verticals, we have 30% plus
exposure on ad revenues coming for the large Internet companies and that would
show up essentially in the second quarter when these companies are reporting and
give us some guidance.
Now ad growth slowdown in 1H is going to be the bigger impact we estimate for
Facebook, i's going to be upwards of $2 billion. For Google, it's going to be $3
billion. This continues potentially part of 2H as advertising coming back online for
diﬀerent sectors will have diﬀerent pace, but given that these three verticals might
move slowly back up, we expect like the impact to sort of continue in 3Q, The hope
is that all the rightful steps that the companies are taking to minimize the impact in
the second half could taper this hit as we near the end. The other aspect of
advertising, which is very important is event cancellations. This, in particular, is
important for Twitter as Twitter has become largely an event-driven company in the
recent years and if key events like Olympics are at risk, that would have a signiﬁcant
impact on Twitter's revenue growth expectations.
The biggest unknown really for the Internet sector and advertising in general for
Google, for Facebook remains small and medium businesses, small and medium
businesses are pretty much the lifeblood of these companies in terms of growth and
all the closures that we are seeing right now raise that uncertainty as to what the
impact could be. That's why we think like looking at what Chinese internet
companies based in the face of those closures could give us some idea, but we
believe a double-digit decline is going to happen in the second quarter.
E-commerce, this one is interesting where demand is spiking across the board. We
are seeing not just for Amazon, but for other apps in e-commerce in general sort of
like get higher demand and Amazon is hiring 100,000 more people now to service
the demand. This should help some revenue growth oﬀset, if you may, because of
the demand of people working from home and they are trying to shore up the
capacity, but what's diﬀerent this time really is the cost of logistics will go up.
Historically, we have seen when the capacity is overwhelmed, the cost to go up, but
Amazon is raising compensation for its current workforce rightfully so which will cost
about $350 million while incremental hiring of 100,000 people to support the spike
in demand may also come at an additional cost. So what we believe happening this
year is, if you look at Amazon's business in general, everything excluding AWS isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 12 of 18Anurag Ranaexpected to have an operating margin of about 2.2%, which is pretty much ﬂat from
2019. We don't believe that number will be hit, it might actually come close to 0% in
that scenario.
The one positive we see for the sector really here is cloud because of utilization
being such a sensitive measure for cloud, as work from home drives more usage
across the board, we are going to see a margin uptick because of that. Amazon said
this in early 2019 that every single percentage point increase in utilization leads to
tens and millions of dollars of savings. So you would see the higher utilization
because of work from home because of all the online engagement actually beneﬁts
and so sort of create an oﬀsets for the Internet companies exposed to this trend from
a cloud perspective.
Now what about the valuations? The valuations have actually dipped below the 2015
levels. We feel the sum total of this is, you're seeing double-digit declines in
expectations for ﬁrst half, high-single digits for the whole year. If we look at
valuations, it is reﬂecting this, the sharp decline from a 2015 low perspective, but it
doesn't really capture a recession scenario, and one reference point I'll give you is
Google -- Google's growth slowed down to single-digits in 2009 when that
happened. So it is an uncertain unknown thing for second half as to would it sort of
dip to double digits, but here's what we do know. These companies have the
strongest balance sheets in the world, 70% of world's online population is using their
services every month. And they're getting exposed to new features, use cases like
WhatsApp for business, groceries for Whole Foods, Verily for Google. So the secular
tailwinds that have been driving double-digit growth for the Internet sector, we
expect that to pause, but it won't stop longer term. So we do expect that as we
weather the storm, the double-digit growth curve for the Internet sector should
resume next year.
Hopefully, this gives you a perspective for the Internet sector. And with that, I will
pass it on to Anurag Rana for his views on software.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Thank you, Jitendira. So from our perspective, it's a bit diﬀerent than what we have
seen for some of the other sectors, largely because at least for the near term, it's
going to have -- the virus is going to have a less of an impact on some of the stuﬀ
that's already booked, especially for companies that have very large support revenue
or a very large subscription base. Typically what happens is, you have this revenue
that's already been in the books, it's just a matter of how it ﬂowed through the
income statement. Now as far as the virus is concerned, the impact we see is going
to be more in the area of deal cycles being elongated. New product sales, so as far
as we could say that the expectations going into next month could be okay or may
not be as bad as we saw in the case of Oracle, which actually did slightly better than
what people expected. But the bigger kicker would be we could see new product
sales to suﬀer most and that would reﬂect both in the case of license sales as well as
new cloud sales. Those are the two areas that we think are going to see the ﬁrst signs
of a slowdown. And in the case of cloud-based companies, we could see impact onFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 13 of 18their revenue performance obligation numbers, which is the number that ﬂows into
revenue over the next 12 months to 24 months.
The one area we think we could see some kind of a -- you could say, boost going
into it, is demand boost for collaboration software, you can talk about Slack, we can
talk about Microsoft Teams. I'm sure everybody's talked ad nauseam about Zoom
and how that the number of downloads have gone up.
So at the end of the day, the software industry is about providing productivity tools
to both the consumer and the enterprise, we think this could drive more growth
going -- coming out of this particular problem, but for the short term, I think, we
think, companies that provide some collaboration software could see a leg up.
So with that, I want to brieﬂy discuss valuations. Now we have looked at some of the
valuations come down compared to last four years or ﬁve years, but frankly we have
not moved on to the areas where it is going back to the '09-'10 levels. So before I
jump into the services world, I wanted to take a minute and go through some of the
bigger names that we cover and see how do we think they're going to fare over the
next couple of quarters or so. So I'm starting with Microsoft, for example, we are
looking at Microsoft has a fairly sizable, let's say, stable commercial base. I think the
annuity on commercial base is closer to 80%, 90% and so company signs or
enterprises sign long-term agreements with Microsoft to provide -- for Microsoft to
provide their products to them. So Microsoft has a fairly stable commercial business,
the consumer business is the one where we could see some weakness and the area
where we could see in the case of one of their segments called the PC area where
we could see some hardware sales problems, similar to what Anand said, and
because of supply chain concern, Microsoft has already pulled their guidance from
that division. So that's I think where we see the most impact for them. Going into the
other areas, their cloud business, the transactional part of it, I think should be able to
hold up because if you are utilizing more cloud-based applications, you would see a
lot more transactions go through that. The stable nature of subscriptions that is
provided by Oﬃce 365, that should be again a stable element for them.
The second big company is Oracle, they just reported and things looked okay for
them, and in fact they reported better numbers than what most people expected.
For the case of Oracle, it has some very large support base. Now their big issue was
they were behind in the cloud, and they were not able to migrate a lot of the
databases out there, but I guess the silver lining of that is, it also provided a very,
very large support base for them to get recurring revenue from and that actually is
holding it right. And their subscription base on there, some of the fusion cloud
products, that's also holding up.
Moving on to SAP, now this company we think has has a very high Europe exposure
and could be I think one of the few software companies could see some downside to
both sales and EPS revisions going into next quarter and even after that is because
of its very high exposure to Europe as well as it also runs a product called Ariba,
which has a fair amount of transaction revenue that ﬂows through them and then less
of subscription nature.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 14 of 18Moving on to VMware, this is again a company we can see some weakness on their
license sale. But the support base it has largely from, it's a very large virtualization
software itself, should be able to oﬀset some of that risk.
Salesforce.com, this company has also done a fair amount of good work, I would say,
in a very stable subscription nature of what they do, they acquired a couple of
companies over the last two years and I think that should help mitigate some of the
organic slowdown in new business signings that they will also encounter, but given
such a diverse product portfolio, I think it is less insulated some of the single product
companies out there, and which brings us to Workday. Workday has a bit of an issue
when it comes, because their core HCM product is slowing down and their biggest
hopes, the next future growth, is pinned to their cloud-based ERP solution and that's
an area we think it's possibly given how big of a commitment it is from companies,
given the disruption that's going on, maybe it takes a bit of a back seat in the near
future. But having said that, I think Workday's prospects coming out of this -- it's also
one of those companies that has a very superior product both in -- both the areas
that they service.
The last two companies in software that we cover, both Shopify and Adobe, have a
fairly hard -- fairly large exposure to consumer-related products, and those are the
ones that could see some either I could say pull-back on spending.
Moving onto services, I think this is an area where it's again going to be less of an
impact. But nevertheless, they should see stuﬀ as well. Now within the tech services
names, we think consulting is the one that gets aﬀected more than outsourcing,
largely because of this discretionary nature of the consulting work, that gets
impacted more. Companies with the larger European exposure such as Capgemini
are the ones that will be impacted. Given that banks spend a lot on IT services and
given what's happening to interest rates over the last few weeks, we think bank IT
spending is likely going to get weaker over the next 12 months. Even the oﬀshore
work is not immune to a slowdown. So oﬀshore companies such as Cognizant, such
as TCS, such as Infosys that depend a lot on banking IT spending could see some
slowdown in their growth rates, but one thing to remember for almost all services
companies, going into the year, they typically have 90% of the revenue already
locked in. So they are I think still better protected than some of the other companies
in the tech ecosystem, and for us, the areas that we would be watching closely would
be their bookings numbers going into the next quarter and see how they come up
with.
Now, within the services space, we think Accenture is one company that has a much
more, I would say, well diversiﬁed business model. If you see in the last -- last time
we looked at Accenture, going back into '09-'10 time-frame, you could see their
revenues fell down quite a bit, but we think this is a very diﬀerent company at this
point, less of an impact than some of the other individual companies just because of
a very well-diversiﬁed business model, they have a unique way of acquiring small
entities and scaling that up, they have a very large digital footprint, very large global
oﬀshore footprint. We think this would be, on a comparative basis, less of an impact
on Accenture than it would be for the rest of the space.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17

Page 15 of 18John ButlerNow, with that, I'm going to pass it along to my colleague, John Butler, on Telecom.
{BIO 16869584 <GO>}
(Technical Diﬃculty) I cover Telecoms and equipment vendors. And as you can see
on this ﬁrst chart, consensus revenue estimate and EPS for the sector really haven't
come down a lot and I think a lot of that reﬂects the fact that the telecoms are
relatively immune to a really sizable impact from the virus.
Having said that, let me start here with the Apple and just provide some thoughts on
how I think it's going to play out for them. I think number one, the important thing to
keep in mind for Apple is that any lost sales in second quarter or third quarter aren't
going to be lost forever, the majority of Apple's device business really represents
upgrades as opposed to organic growth. So my sense is that we'll see pushouts
maybe to the fourth quarter or even into next year. But lost sales are not lost forever.
I'm running a base case scenario on the total impact between this quarter and next,
which is ﬁscal second and third quarter for Apple. Our base case scenario suggests a
$0.50 impact to EPS, and roughly $7 billion to $10 billion -- again what are likely to be
mostly postponed sales as opposed to lost sales.
The big issue this quarter was centered in China where we had not only an impacted
demand but also a supply shock. The good news there is that the rate of new
infections in China is now beginning to recede. The bad news is, there is now a
demand impact evolving in western markets, particularly in Europe, and now here in
the US.
My best guess is, it's -- we're probably going to follow a similar bell curve to China, I
think that the sudden change in behavior here in the states and Western Europe with
social distancing, the advent of warmer weather to come starting in May is really
going to help quell the spread and I think largely conﬁne it to 2Q and 3Q.
Shifting now to a look on how it's impacted Apple's valuation, as many of you know,
Apple is more than 25% oﬀ its high. If you look back in early January, this stock was
trading at 24 times the forward four quarter PE ratio. This chart suggests to me that
we're headed back to a mean of 15 times to 16 times. But again, it's sort of the fear-
driven trading environment. So it's diﬃcult to say whether or not it will overshoot.
But I think concerns are really getting baked in here for almost a worst-case scenario
here in the States.
Switching gears to telecom. I think the title says it all, telecoms are relatively immune
to a virus impact. Overall, we expect from quarantining and so forth, maybe a 2%
impact on the annual sales. For the carriers, the good news is their high-margin
service revenue really should beneﬁt from the work-at-home trend, but equipment
sales could get dented as all the carriers are beginning now to close their retail
stores, particularly mall-based stores. So you're going to have much lower foot
traﬃc, though I would emphasize equipment sales are lower margin than the
services business -- pardon me, and represent a much smaller percent of their total
revenue.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 16 of 18Q - Mandeep Singh
Q - Julie ChariellOne question I get a lot is, will the virus really derail the deployment of 5G services
here in the US? And I think the best answer is, maybe, we could see potential labor
shortages, if we get a very broad outbreak here in the States. There is already a
shortage of tower climbers as they call them, the folks that climb towers and put
spectrum into service and equipment into -- into service at the cell towers. And so
again, I think, a boost in sick leave among that labor force could lead to a shortage
of workers, and of course, there is risk to equipment shortages as well, so net-net,
our expectation is risk of a modest impact. But I think as we get into the second half,
we're back to full steam ahead there.
Taking a look at telecom valuations, you can see, they've come in with the market.
But again, in terms of how these businesses are insulated from the virus, telecoms
along with utilities are about as good as it gets. Again, because it really is a services
based revenue model.
With that, let me sort of close my portion of the discussion with just some quick
thoughts on the wireless equipment vendors, including Nokia and Ericsson. Both of
them coming into the quarter faced supply risk out of China getting critical
components to make their gear. There is now a bit of a demand side risk. Again, it's
much smaller in comparison. Ericsson also faced a much higher risk in China than
Nokia, because they have the bigger business there. I think the good news for them
at this point is that again the rate of new infections in China is dropping rapidly and
so they're getting back to business there and I think those supply constraints will
begin to ease over coming months as opposed to get worse.
What did happen is equipment sales again may get dented as new network
construction here in the US and Europe slows if there is a lot of sick leave among the
workforce. With this in mind, we've modeled in a base case scenario of 5% risk to
revenue. But overall, again, I think the fallout for these two names will be modest,
and again, the good news is that a lot of factories are now getting back to work --
getting back to work in China.
With that, let me turn it back to Mandeep for Q&A.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Thank you, John. We may have time for a couple of questions. So Julie, if you're on,
can you talk about the cross-border payment exposure for the top companies like
Visa and Mastercard?
{BIO 17144999 <GO>}
Sure, thanks Mandeep. Visa and Mastercard don't provide the speciﬁc amount of
revenue or TPV from cross-border transactions. Best estimates I've seen are that is
somewhere between 5% and 7%. They do provide growth though every quarter and
I can tell you for Visa in the past year or so cross-border has grown slightly lowerFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 17 of 18Q - Mandeep Singh
Q - Geetha Ranganathan
Q - Mandeep Singh
Q - Anand Srinivasanthan the corporate average, and for Mastercard, it's grown slightly higher, so visits to
cross-border could accrue a bit more to Mastercard than to Visa, as things slow
down, but it still seems to be well less than 10% of their TPV.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you, Julie. And Geetha, really quick, can you discuss subscriber growth
tailwind for streaming companies like Netﬂix, Hulu, Disney as a result of COVID-19?
{BIO 15007716 <GO>}
Sure, Mandeep. So obviously this is a big boost to all of the streaming services. We
ran some numbers. As people get shut in, obviously they're streaming more and
more. We actually ran some numbers for the February mobile downloads in the Asia
region for Netﬂix and we saw that there was a 30% increase and we expect very
similar increases in the US in March. The thing is though, even with the subscriber
tailwinds, there are a couple of things that you need to factor in. So there has been
some debate about what this really does for a company like Netﬂix, for instance,
because it's really a more like an all-you-can-eat buﬀet and even if you have people
spending like four hours on Netﬂix, what does it necessarily do for them? There is no
ad revenue. Does it translate into a signiﬁcant increase in revenue? Probably not, but
I think what it does is, as more and more people want to go on simultaneous
streaming, there's probably going to be an upgrade to more expensive tiers. So
that's probably how it beneﬁts them, and between the services themselves, we think
Netﬂix is the best position, just because of the breadth and depth of content, I mean
the sheer tonnage of content that they have, there is a steady stream of new content
landing all the time and that kind of puts them at an advantage, especially when the
Coronavirus has kind of postponed productions for a lot of these newer streaming
services because you have Disney Plus for instance some high proﬁle originals like
Marvel's, the Falcon and Winter Soldier has kind of been put on hold, Netﬂix itself
has actually shut down all the ﬁlm and TV production, but they still have a lot of
pipeline of good shows that they're bringing on their service.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Thank you, Geetha, and Anand, you get the last one. So can you talk about the best
and worst case scenario for how long the impact of COVID-19 lasts for your supply
chain guys?
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Thank you, Mandeep. So on the EV side, the best case scenario is that we return to
90% utilization in the next month, particularly in China, we've seen Hon Hai and the
assemblers as well as most of the fabs. The semiconductor factories are actually
mostly located outside of China. So this is Korea, Taiwan, and to a lesser degree,
Japan, US and Singapore. So those factories have higher utilization as well as supply
chain assembly of the gear, if you may, we want to see that return to 90%, that's sort
of the threshold number well ahead of the Q3 -- calendar Q3. If that happens in the
May time-frame, that is fantastic, the April time-frame is better.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-17
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 18 of 18Q - Mandeep SinghThe worst case scenario is that we don't return to that 90% number through 2Q and
through 3Q and when that happens, the all-important quarter for semiconductors
and for assemblers is actually the 3Q period, ahead of 4Q. If you don't have
production and assembly of the gear into late 2Q and even early 2Q, then you lose
potentially what is 30% to 35% of the year worth of sales in that one quarter and that
would destroy your 2020 estimates.
So that would put us into the worst case scenario and hopefully that gives some
color regarding the supply chain.
