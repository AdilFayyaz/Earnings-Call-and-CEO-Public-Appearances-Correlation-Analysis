Presentation
Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. I have the pleasure
of kicking oﬀ this session moderating our discussion with Brett Biggs of Walmart.
Brett, as you know, is Executive Vice President and CFO for the Corporation. He's
been in that capacity for about a year, a little less. Prior to that, many of us knew him
as the Chief Financial Oﬃcer for Walmart International. Prior to that, he had been
CFO for Walmart US. He had a number of other roles at Walmart dating back to the
year 2000.
Walmart, of any company among the 40-plus occurring at this conference, really
needs no introduction. But I will tell you as big as this Company is -- and as you can
see from our top 100 exhibits, it is the largest retailer in the world by a very generous
margin -- the story today, I think, is more dynamic than it's been certainly in any time
since I've followed the Company.
And I think it's very safe to say that Walmart is very much one of the meaningful
disruptors in the retailing industry here in 2016 and one of the disruptive forces. And
there are a number of real strategic thrusts, I think, that we have seen over the past
year or less that I think we'll cover as we move from theme to theme in our
discussion with Brett today.
Ordinarily, I would not have led with e-commerce in a discussion with Walmart. But
you all sort of forced the issue by acquiring Jet just a few weeks ago -- or I should say
announcing the pending acquisition of Jet. So talk to us if you would about the
strategic play of this transaction.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Sure. And thank you for having us -- having me here. It's always a -- it's a conference
we've come to pretty much every year since I remember coming to the Company. SoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 2 of 16Matt Fassler
Brett Biggswe are always pleased to come here.
Actually, I got to spend a little bit of time yesterday with our new team hopefully very
soon over at Jet. And got to spend some time with the team and getting to know
them a little better -- the ﬁnance team. But also some of the business team. And
we're really excited about what's going on at Jet and what we can do with the
business.
There's a lot of diﬀerent ways to think about, I think, the Jet transaction. And there's -
- I kind of break it out into three diﬀerent pieces. And the ﬁrst would just be Jet on its
own. Jet is an exciting brand. It's a fairly new company obviously. But they do some
things that are really unique. They've grown very quickly. What they do with their
smart card technology is really interesting and something that's unique in the way
they build the basket and encourage the customer to build a basket.
And so having that brand, which is very interesting, very unique, is great for us. And
there's things that you can do with a brand like Jet.com that's diﬀerent than what we
do at Walmart.com.
The second piece of value is the team. Mark Lore and the team have done great
things with Jet -- they did great things with Quidsi prior to that. And so the ability to
take what that team knows -- their industry knowledge -- and what they do and
helping us continue to grow Jet but also Walmart.com is certainly a big beneﬁt for
Walmart.
Then our own existing business with Walmart.com, which is a sizable business. We
now have a SKU count of about 15 million SKUs, which has almost doubled in the last
year. There's a lot of exciting things we are doing there. We've been talking a lot
about the foundation that we've been building at Walmart.com with the systems
work we've been doing, with the fulﬁllment centers that we've been putting in place.
And you saw some of the fruits of that in this last quarter with a little bit of
acceleration in GMB to 13% in the Second Quarter.
So the team has built a really nice foundation in San Bruno with Neil Ashe and
others. And now to have Mark and his team come over and take the great things
they do at Jet and help the Walmart.com business and taking what we do well at
Walmart.com and potentially doing diﬀerent things with Jet, I think, is exciting.
Over time, how do you expect these brands to coexist? Will they coexist? Will one be
folded into the other? Is there a good rationale being Walmart and having this
amazing brand footprint and having a second e-commerce brand that stands for
something else with consumers?

Matt Fassler
Brett BiggsI'm going to take one second because I'm getting the nod from Steve Schmidt. I
didn't talk about a forward-looking statement. And I want to make our attorneys
really happy. So I might make some forward-looking statements today.
Go on our website, take into consideration everything we've said in making
investment decisions. I think our attorneys will be happy now. So after that paid
commercial let's go back to what we were discussing.
Sure. Think about sort of the long-term need for dual brands, for a second brand
under the Walmart umbrella.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. It's something that -- we've had a little bit with stores with Neighborhood Mart.
It's a part of Walmart. But it's been a diﬀerent brand. We deﬁnitely have that as you
look internationally. Globally, we have a lot of -- a number of diﬀerent brands across
the world which gives you opportunities to do diﬀerent things.
I think having a second brand with e-commerce, again, there's just opportunities to
potentially try new things, access diﬀerent types of customers. Jet has a more urban
customer typically than Walmart.com has. So being able to just lever those brands
diﬀerently potentially but taking the strengths of both, I think, is where the
excitement is for the Company.
What about the economics of this transaction? One of the pieces of feedback that
we get is $3 billion -- Walmart can aﬀord to do anything with $3 billion that they want
because it's Walmart. But still when we think about a technology and management
team and some enhancements, that's a lot of money. So how do we think about the
economics of this for you, which I'm sure you all considered as you (inaudible)?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Sure. I'll take a step back and talk about capital allocation. The ﬁrst thing we want to
do as a business is invest back into the business. And we realize we need to do that
in a way that's return-enhancing over time. Our investors expect that and demand
that -- we expect that of ourselves. But the ﬁrst thing we want to do as a Company is
ensure that we are a healthy business long-term. And you are going to want to
allocate capital in a way that ensures that that happens -- understanding the realities
of short-term and midterm expectations.
But the valuation which I just talked about -- the diﬀerent streams of value of the
Company -- we took all that in consideration -- the value of Jet, the team, the ability
to accelerate our own business -- our own e-commerce business. And taking that e-
commerce business and continuing to do what we do well, which is ﬁnd thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07

Page 4 of 16Matt Fassler
Brett Biggs
Matt Fassler
Brett Biggsintersection between what we do in the stores, what we do with e-commerce --
there's a lot of value in that to us in helping accelerate that.
I'm going to talk for a moment about the marketplace business. This past quarter, I
believe, was the First Quarter that we actually saw a delta between GMV growth and
revenue growth in your e-commerce businesses writ large. Can you talk about your
strategy for growing that marketplace business? I know the economics are probably
better than the 1P, if you will, e-commerce business for you.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Sure. Marketplace is a diﬀerent business. But again, stepping back, what we want to
do is we want to be there for the customer. And that can take a lot of diﬀerent forms.
We want to be there if they want to shop in the stores. We want to be there if they
are online. We want to be there if they want to pick up groceries in the store. We
want to be there for that. And the ability to continue to pull all that together is what
makes, I think, Walmart -- makes Walmart Walmart in the future.
We've made some systems enhancements and have done some diﬀerent things over
the last few months. And we talked about that kind of generically in the last couple
of quarters in studying the foundation to be able to grow Marketplace more quickly.
And so the ability to get sellers on more quickly, to give them an alternative as they
want to sell their products -- that's what we want to do. We want to be there for the
customers. First party, third party -- we want to be there for the customer in the way
in which they want to shop.
Then one last question for now in e-commerce -- how diﬀerent is your mix online
versus in-store? I know you are doing less grocery. But I guess are there categories
where you are really succeeding online disproportionate to the in-store mix of
business?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Well you start with just types of businesses that are moving more quickly online. So
you look particularly in electronics would be the ﬁrst one that everyone -- electronics
and media everybody would think about that are mix. While it wouldn't necessarily
be diﬀerent online, you may see -- at times, you might see a similar SKU online as
you do in the store. But we'll have diﬀerent types of SKUs online as well. So you've
got to look ﬁrst at kind of where the customer is going to buy in total.
So you will continue to see diﬀerences, I think, as we go into the future more with
online versus in-store. But giving the customer the ability to -- for one pickup in our
stores, we believe, is a very diﬀerent type of convenience for the customer. Online
grocery has been interesting. Our customers -- we've gotten great feedback fromFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07

Brett Biggscustomers in online grocery. And it's because if you think about Walmart or our
customer, 90% of the US population lives within 10 miles of one of our stores. So it is
an element of convenience to be able to come to one of our stores and pick up your
groceries -- not necessarily get the kids out of the car if you don't want to stop and
pick it up versus waiting at home to get something delivered.
Then sort of melding the online and international elements, I thought a fascinating
deal was your China deal, your JD deal, which was quickly overshadowed by Jet. But
I don't want to lose sight of what you did there. Can you talk about why you did that
transaction, why you beneﬁt from that partnership? And a question that might be
obvious, might not be, why the Chinese market is so diﬀerent from others that you
would go do this deal.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. The JD.com transaction was really interesting. And we had a good business in
Yihaodian. And we liked the direction in which it was going. And there were things
that we could have done with that business. When you just looked at the landscape
in China and you saw what a JD.com was doing. And then doing a lot of it through
ﬁrst-party e-commerce culture that I would say was fairly similar to Walmart -- it was
an interesting alliance with them. And I think there's other opportunities with JD.com
that we can take advantage of over time.
And being able to put together what they do so well from an e-commerce
perspective and marrying that with what we do so well in our stores and with Sam's
Club, it's a growing format in China, we believe, was a great answer for us long-term.
I want to segue, Brett, if I could from online to in-store and talk about pricing. And I
want to get a sense as to how you would frame the changes that you're making. I
guess I'll ask it open-ended initially.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We talked about a year ago in October that we would invest several billion dollars in
price over several years. And then we talked about earlier this year that we were
accelerating some of that price investment. Greg Foran, our head of our US business,
has been talking about for a while that he wanted to get the shop in shape before he
invited everybody to come over. And he felt like the timing was right to accelerate
some of that.
And just to back up, Walmart always invests in price. It's not something -- there's not
an on/oﬀ switch with price. There are times that we'll be more aggressive or more
intentional about it. But we're always investing in price. As you can imagine, we have
a team that pretty much all they do is pricing. And they think about competitiveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 16Matt Fassler

Brett Biggsdynamics. They think about by category -- they think about by item. So there is a lot
of analytics and a lot of thought that goes into those decisions. And I think one
advantage we have is the ability to take price across a very wide assortment.
Walmart -- we always want to be the best price for a basket. So being able to price
diﬀerently in GM as well as food and really show that customer value in diﬀerent
parts of the business, I think, is unique to how we can approach price.
What is the relationship for -- between the store improvements that you're making --
labor investment/store improvements -- and pricing? Is one necessarily the precursor
of the other?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It goes back to that comment I just said a minute ago. And Greg has talked about
wanting to get the house in shape before inviting everybody over. And I think that as
he thought about the sequencing of it, that was in our minds as we thought about
that -- is getting the stores in a little better shape from a customer perspective. And I
think the team has done a great job with that.
The wage investment was an important part of that. You think about how we work
with associates and what that looks like over a longer period of time. And with the
market we felt like that was the right timing for that.
But if you look at the results and you look at the Second Quarter with the 1.6% comp
and the traﬃc, I think you just have to the at a number of those things that all come
into play. Another one being inventory -- if you look at our comp inventory being
down 6.5% in the Second Quarter but in-stocks being up, that's a great combination
if you can get that to work together. So Matt, I think it's just the number of things
coming together at the same time.
I want to frame the next question by conceding that there probably hasn't been a
Walmart analyst meeting in the past number of years where you haven't talked about
price. I would say it does seem like there's something a little more palpable,
tangible, broad. How -- what inning are we in? How much of what we are going to
see have we seen so far -- whether it's your move through the mix, whether it's your
geographic breadth in terms of the pricing enhancements that you are looking to
implement?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I'll put it in the context of how we described it a year ago. And I think that gives you
some sense of it. A year ago we said, again, it's several billion dollars over a three-
year period, with the majority of that being in the second and third year, whichFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07

Brett Biggswould be next year and the year after. But we did say we accelerated some of that
into the First Quarter -- I mean, the ﬁrst part of the year. So we are ahead of where
we said we would be about a year ago on that pricing journey but haven't been any
more speciﬁc about how we're thinking about other than what we said last October.
Now, is there a merchandising of the mix going on? In other words, clearly you are
cutting price in some categories that have good proﬁle and that make a diﬀerence
for you. And that's clearly helped your traﬃc. Are prices only moving in one
direction? Is there a price -- can there be a price optimization exercise in lower-
proﬁle SKUs that would help fund some of that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
You always look at price optimization. I think the way you look at it, you've got to
look at how you mix out whether it's online, whether it's in-store. And that's decisions
that your merchants make every day. But you always want that customer coming
away realizing that on a basket of goods that they got the best deal at Walmart. And
that's who we are as a Company.
I want to ask about gross margin for a moment. And your gross margin has been
moving higher. It's now, I think, four quarters running that the US gross margin has
been up. Doug told a very interesting anecdote at the analysts' Q&A subsequent to
the annual meeting in June about when he was a merchant in his early days -- in
order to drive gross margin, cut price -- and talked about that, which was really
clever at the same time. To those of us who haven't actually seen it work, it seems a
bit still counterintuitive.
How would you frame the gross margin drivers? Now that you are cycling that ﬁrst
nice pop that you saw in the Third Quarter of last year, can you continue to
implement the price investments that sound like they have a couple of years ahead
of them and at least hold the growth, if not grow them as you have been?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
There's a lot of elements to gross margin, a lot of elements to your question. So I'll
try to address it a little bit at a time. I think with gross margin, one, is it would
encourage everybody to look at it over a period of time. There are times where gross
margin -- you get a beneﬁt, you get something that's not a beneﬁt. But you have got
to look at it over time to get a sense of, I think, what a company is doing.
There's a number of things that drive gross margin. And so if you think about things
like shrink, which we've improved some this year. We have talked about that.
Obviously the cost going into the product. And we've been doing work with our
suppliers around that. Logistics costs, which are helped a little bit right now with fuelFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 16Matt Fassler
Brett Biggs
Matt Fasslerprices -- so, there's a lot of things that drive improvement. And mix would be a part
of that as well.
As you also think about gross margin rate, you really have to focus on gross margin
dollars. And if you think about the productivity loop -- and I think that's where Doug
was getting to this June. Think about the productivity loop -- if you can drive sales,
you can lower cost, you could have a period of time where your gross margin rate is
lower. But gross margin dollars are higher. If you can get the sales, the top-line
growth. And we're seeing that top-line growth today as we take these initiatives.
And so I think you just have to look at all of it within the framework of the total
company. And I'd add SG&A to that. We have certainly leaned into wages and some
other things that have delevered our cost structure over the last couple of years. And
that's been intentional. But you should still think about the productivity loop with
Walmart when you think about expenses.
So there's a lot of levers to pull and a lot of buttons to push to get the business to
where you want it to be.
I want to talk for a minute about that proﬁt growth and gain. Everything you've done,
you've basically said you would do -- or you've done what you said, phrasing it
another way. For the moment, Walmart US -- you are growing a better comp -- you're
not growing operating income. You have the investment and labor, it was
foreshadowed. So there's no surprise there.
I'm curious about whether -- if you think about the markets, where you've cut price
and the traﬃc has accelerated. And that strategy is working. Is the operating income
trend in those markets better than in other markets where you have yet to implement
the totality of those pricing moves?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, I think there's a lot of things you have got to think about when you think of
comp sales. And price is a piece of the puzzle, certainly operating the way you're
operating a store, the customer experience -- all of that plays into what you see from
a comp sales perspective. So it's hard, I think, to isolate one element. But it's
certainly a big part of what we do and I think always will do as a Company. And it's
taking all the pieces of the business and running them in a way that they can
optimize. You can optimize each part of the business. But ensuring that long-term
that it works in a way that makes sense for the Company as well as for the investor.
I want to move on if I can to the wage hikes and talk about what you think those have
done for you strategically. I know that Walmart is supposed to think about its
narrative, its prominent enterprise. Talk about what the consequences have been.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07

It's been, as you can imagine, very favorably received in stores. When you go to an
annual meeting like I went to in Denver a couple of weeks ago, it's certainly
discussed and certainly appreciated by the associates. And it puts more money in
their wallets as well to spend. And we assume some of that is coming back into our
stores.
You've got to be at least competitive with the wage market all the time. And that's
something that we'll continue to monitor. But we want really good associates in
Walmart. But we also want associates that want to make -- there are some associates
who will want to make a career at Walmart. And we want to give them an entry point
into which to start that career and let them have a pathway to bigger jobs. You look
at our CEO, Doug McMillon, starting in a warehouse in Walmart. And you have
stories like that. And it's really balancing all of that with the P&L of the business and
ensuring that economically it makes sense over time. And I do believe part of that is
some of the improvement you're seeing in the business today.
Great. Also in the domestic business, there's been some reallocation of labor around
the box. Just last week there were some stories about reallocating rolls away from
accounting and invoicing in stores, presumably either saving that money or
reallocating it to selling functions. Talk about how you've thought about labor
allocation, broadly speaking, in and around your boxes and where you stand in
terms of that.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Sure. We just talked about eﬃciency and ways that Walmart can continue to be more
eﬃcient. We've made some really nice progress around shared services. And that's
part of what you're seeing with this -- with the initiative. And what you are discussing
is taking some of those functions and putting them in a shared services center where
we're more eﬃcient and can do things versus instead of doing that store by store.
Now, a lot or a great number of those associates will continue to work with Walmart
and be in another hopefully more customer-facing roles within the business.
But if you go back even to some of the changes we made last year -- putting more
department managers back into the business. And if you go into Walmart today, you
will see more people on the ﬂoor than you would have seen two years ago. If you
look at some of the technology that we put into our back rooms which has had
associates spend much less time in the back rooms, more time ensuring shelves are
stocked, ensuring they are spending time with customers -- all of that has been from
the standpoint of ensuring customer service is better.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07

Brett BiggsGreat. I want to move on -- actually, stick with the domestic business for one moment
because it's just so topical. How are you managing food deﬂation, which is
happening above and beyond your own pricing stance? And where do you feel we
are on the food deﬂation continuum?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I'll start with the last part. I wish I had a crystal ball as to where we are with food
deﬂation. It's been a category -- some categories have been around quite a while.
Meat and dairy speciﬁcally have been around quite a while. So I'd hate to have to try
to predict where that will go.
Again, when you look at our assortment we'll have probably diﬀerent opportunities
than maybe some other retailers in that. With GM and with food, you see diﬀerent
periods of time where you may have inﬂation in one category, deﬂation in another
category. Food has been fairly signiﬁcant. And we called that out in our earnings
releases. But it does give us, I think, a little better opportunity of how to work with
that. But long-term, again, we want customers shopping with Walmart. And part of
that is making sure they get the right price at Walmart no matter what environment
we're in.
I want to ask a question or two about international. And as I think about your three
largest markets for the international business as being the UK and Mexico and
Canada, the UK is the one that probably most deserves a little bit of discussion
today. And you just had a management change. There's been a market share issue,
frankly, for the entire legacy retail ecosystem in the UK. Talk to us about as those
initiatives to regain market share -- you had always talked about out there very much
in the portfolio context and the contribution to the international P&L.. How are you
evolving that thinking today?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It's been a challenging market for a year, if not two years. And we've seen periods of
time in the UK where the market has gotten a bit challenging. Three or four years
ago probably, we were talking about vouchering and other things in the UK. And we
didn't really participate in that. And I think long-term we're glad that we didn't.
It is a diﬀerent environment in the UK today with discounters -- I think everybody
realizes that. And how you compete with a discounter is a little bit diﬀerent than you
might compete with a traditional retailer.
We have -- we've been thoughtful about at Asda about how we think about the mix --
whether it's cash ﬂow, whether it's proﬁt, whether it's sales. And as Doug mentioned
in our Second Quarter release, we have a sense of urgency about ensuring that Asda
is successful. We're not happy with the comp sales that we see today in that market.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07

Brett BiggsWith a new management team -- I've known Sean Clark for a long time. He and I kind
of grew up in the Company together. He's by far one of our most well-traveled
executives. Growing up in the UK, I think, is helpful. But also having seen our
operations in Germany, Japan, Canada, China and being able to now take those
learnings back to the UK will be very helpful.
They're going to focus on what you would focus on, which is the fundamentals of
retail. It's pricing -- it's how your store is operated -- it's merchandising. And there's a
number of diﬀerent things within those areas that we can always be better. Our store
operations, I think, can be more -- I use the word retail-tainment. Probably need to
get back to that maybe a little bit more at Asda than what we've had over the past
couple of years. Our pricing has got to be sharp. Your private-label quality has got to
be fantastic. We've always had good private label with Asda. And that's how you
have to compete with the discounters. We have diﬀerentiators -- like George in the
apparel brand, I think, gives us a diﬀerentiator with our customers. But we've just got
to continue to get better.
I want to start the process of opening up the ﬂoor to mics. And it's extremely hard to
see, particularly on that side of the room. So it may be hard --
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It's very bright.
So we have -- if you can get the roving mics out and about -- and we have a couple
of people up front. I'm going to start oﬀ by asking one of the four questions that
we're asking all the companies at the conference. And, frankly, I think all four are
probably relevant for Walmart more so than for any other company.
The ﬁrst one is a very basic one. Are your expectations for the consumer backdrop
for the second half of the year better, worse or even vis-a-vis what you saw from a
backdrop perspective in the Second Quarter?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We haven't -- we said this before. we haven't seen a meaningful change in the
consumer. I think the consumer generally is okay. There's things that are working in
their favor -- whether it's interest rates, fuel prices, unemployment rate -- all of that is
pretty favorable for the consumer. I think there's still probably a little bit of hesitancy
in that that stems even back from 2009 and 2010 when people remember a tougher
time.
And that's why you have seen the savings rate go up -- you have seen people paying
down debt. You continue to see a little bit of that. I wish I could predict what fuelFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantprices would be six months from now and how the consumer might react to that. But
we haven't seen that dramatic of a change, really, in the past and would assume
that's probably where we will go in the future.
We'll go back and forth -- the audience and myself -- for the ﬁrst question.
Questions And Answers
I had two questions -- one on grocery and the trends there. And the other on wage
rates and the economy.
The ﬁrst one on the grocery business -- most of us would probably simply say that
the grocery industry is a mess right now because of deﬂation and because of the
competitive intensity. When you look at this year, is it solely -- do you think it's solely
a function of deﬂation that has impacted IDs? Or do you look at your own market
share as the largest grocer in the United States and say, no, we are up 50 or we are
up 100 basis points in Nielsen scanner data from last year. And so is the
competition?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Sure. We see the same data you do, for the most part, about how competitors are
doing -- switching data, other things like that. I think you can never pin it down to
one thing. Deﬂation is a piece of what you're seeing. We're focused on our
operations. And again, the things we are doing from a pricing perspective, the things
we're doing from a store standards perspective, we believe, are contributing to what
we're doing.
Then with wage rates, you and others are leading. But generally, I think we've all
anecdotally heard of stories of businesses having diﬃculty ﬁnding quality individuals
to be their partners in business. And so that's led to a level of frustration and
complexity that perhaps hadn't been there last year or two years ago. Could you
discuss your HR practices and ability to hire and attract and keep people this year
versus last year and the prior year?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Can you repeat that last part of the question? I'm sorry -- it's a little hard to hear up
here.
Just how do you ﬁnd the labor market in terms of getting people you need into your
stores this year versus the prior couple of years?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07

Right. Part of getting the workforce that you want -- wages is a part of that piece.
Training is a part of that. And I think a part of what was not missed necessarily but
underplayed a bit on when we announced our wage rate increases was the dollars
that we were also putting into training.
And part of having people happy in their roles is making their jobs easier. And so
some of the things we've done from a technology standpoint in the back rooms to
free up people to help customers, free up people to get items on the shelf -- that
makes customers happy. That makes the relationship with the associate better. All of
that plays into how you keep your workforce current and how you keep them happy.
So again, I don't think it's any one speciﬁc thing than we're really focused on all of
those as far as getting the right associates.
So the question I want to ask next before we go to the next audience member --
simplistically speaking, wage inﬂation -- given that you are paying more but you also
have a customer who probably beneﬁts from the net eﬀect of rising wages --. And I
want to separate your proactive or preemptive moves earlier and just think about the
general wage inﬂation of the marketplace -- a net positive or a net negative for your
business?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think you could take either side of the question you just asked. Obviously if you add
cost to your business, you need to get productivity and get beneﬁt out of that
increased cost, or your shareholders or your customer don't beneﬁt from that. So
you always have to keep that balance. Having our associates have more money
hopefully makes them better associates but also puts more money in their pocket, as
you were referring to. So I think you could take diﬀerent points on that one.
In the last quarter you cited higher gross margins in food and consumables. Did
deﬂation contribute to the arithmetic on those categories?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Well it plays a part of the gross margin equation. But again, you've got to look at the
other things that we talked about that hit gross margin as well, whether that's shrink
that throws from a fresh perspective. Whether that's absolute cost in on the product -
- all of that goes into that equation. So it's bits and pieces of all of that.
Then on those things -- so, better COGS, lower transportation, lower shrink and
probably lower markdowns because the inventories are lower -- would those things -
- do you see those things continuing for the rest of the year as positives for you?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07

Sure. Improving inventory helps in so many diﬀerent areas. Labor, accidents, time
spent moving inventory -- all of that is a huge beneﬁt for the store. Markdowns is a
piece of that. As you're able to keep inventory at the level you want, certainly you
have less opportunity from a markdown perspective. And if you can do that and,
again, keep in stocks better, that's the equation. I've seen -- we've had periods of
time where we've taken inventory down and have not had the right equation within
stocks being better. Right now, we're able to do both. You have to do both to be
successful.
Then the ﬁnal thing I had was once we year-round the second wage increase and we
get into spring of 2017, where would you see in the US your cost increases going? Or,
said diﬀerently, where would the leverage point be from a margin perspective on
cost on your SG&A?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
From an SG&A perspective?
For the US business once we fully round-trip the wage increase.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Right, which will be the end of February basically next year. When you have a
business the size of Walmart -- Walmart US by itself, there's a lot of diﬀerent places
that you can ﬁnd those leverage points. And we've been great at that over the years.
We haven't been as good as we should have been in the past few years. You always
want to be more productive as a company. And you see things we're doing around
scan-and-go, more self-checkout, again, getting associates where they can spend
more time with the customer -- that's all about productivity.
There's not any one speciﬁc place from a leverage standpoint. I think there's just a
number of things we can continue to do. I get the question all the time about what
inning we are in from an expense saving standpoint. And we say the productivity
loop is a loop for a reason. There really isn't an end to what we can do from an
expense management standpoint. I've been here 16 years. And I'll go in a store, I can
go in the home oﬃce. And there's just always things we can do better.
We have a question from Bert in front.

opportunities, before storms where what we saw across the country, your
competitors appear to be asleep at the switch -- your competitors in dollar, discount,
food and drugs, as well as club. You along with two others were real signiﬁcant
standouts, to your credit, pre-storm for the Walmart team and seem to be the best in
the US before natural disasters in terms of taking care of the community and the
customer. Thank you.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. We've always been pretty good at that. We have what we call EOC, the
emergency operations center, that we have. And depending on the size of the storm
or the severity of what's going on or in the country, we have people that are pretty
much working 24-7 to ensure not only do we have product in the right places ahead
of activity so people can get ready for that storm or whatever is going on.
But also we are really quick coming in behind that as well. And that's not just with
what we do from an operations standpoint but what we do from a charitable
standpoint in getting the community back on its feet.
And I'd use Baton Rouge -- the terrible ﬂooding in Baton Rouge and the over $1
million that we put into that community after that event. And so we can help
customers in a lot of diﬀerent ways. Sometimes it is just getting food on their shelves
and water to ﬁrst responders and just ensuring that we're there for the community.
But we've -- going all the way back to Katrina have taken that as a very serious part of
our business.
I want to ask what might end up being the last question. You have seen more of Aldi
and Lidl than any other US retailer, given your exposure in the UK. And Aldi is here
and growing and Lidl is coming imminently. And they have certainly been on ﬁre for
many years and been very much disruptive in their own right. How do you think the
US is diﬀerent in terms of that format's ability to succeed or not? And how will you
come at -- how do you come at markets where you compete with them diﬀerently, if
it all, based on their presence?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Aldi and Lidl are fantastic businesses. Certainly, we are with them in Germany. And
now we've met with them in the UK. And you have to look at the UK and look at
lessons you learn from that and say, how could that be similar to the US. I do think
there are things that are diﬀerent. I think even just the scale of the country and size
as well as the retail market here is a bit diﬀerent than the UK. I think the ability to get
scale in the US probably takes a little bit longer than you would see in the UK, again,
even from a geographic standpoint.
But they're a very good business. And -- but it's like any other competitor that we
have. We have so many competitors -- whether that's online or whether it's dollar
stores or grocery stores or category killers. You've just got to do the same thing withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-07

that as we bring together our physical assets with e-commerce. You've got to be top
of mind with the customer.
And there's just more and more ways -- whether that's with Jet or online grocery or
JD in China-- where we're just giving the customers more ways to interact with
Walmart. And we think that's the winning formula over time.
Great. We have a lot more questions, I'm sure, both in the audience -- and I have
some as well that we won't have time for. Before we break -- next up in this room we
have Under Armour, Samsonite in the Terrace room, Car Auction Services in the
Centennial foyer and thredUP and curbside both in the emerging brands forum in
the Champagne suite. Please join me in thanking Brett for his remarks.
