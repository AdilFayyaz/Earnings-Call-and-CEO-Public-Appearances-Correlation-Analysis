Presentation
Welcome, everybody, to our Executive Q&A Session for the Investment Community. I
hope you all enjoyed this morning's events. It was very special to be back in person
and glad to have you here.
Thanks for those that are on the webcast, we appreciate your interest.
It’s special for a few reasons. One, this is going to be Brett's last Q&A session with
the investment community.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

So thank you, Brett, for your service to the company. We all appreciate your time as
CFO, and your guidance.
I also want to make a very special warm welcome to Maggie Gillian. I don't know
how many people know Maggie Gillian but she was like a rockstar Wall Street analyst
when I was in grade school.
She's been coming down to these meetings when I was pretty young. I was always a
admirer. And her research still graces our bookshelves. We still cite it on a regular
basis. So welcome, Maggie. We appreciate you making the long trip.
Maggie was saying that she probably came to the ﬁrst one in 1970.
Yes. I just asked her that. She said, it was in the ‘70s.
I was like, wow.
There are some great photographs, Maggie, of you and Sam Walton, with you asking
him hard questions. I'm inspired by that.
And then in a canoe.
How many canoe trips did you do?
(Inaudible).
Too many.
Yes.
Yes. And you survived all of that.
Yes. I remember.
You guys don't want to go on a canoe trip anymore, do you?
Maggie says it's fun. We're going to have to do that again.
No, we don't.
I'd say 14 years later it was fun.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Douglas McMillonSo the agenda for this next hour, I'm going to pass it to Doug brieﬂy for some
opening remarks, and then we'll answer your questions. You just have to raise your
hand. My team will have mics, and they'll pass them around. If you could just do us a
favor of stating your name and your ﬁrm for the beneﬁt of those on the webcast, that
would be greatly appreciated.
Before we get started, let me remind you that we may make forward-looking
statements during our discussion today. These statements are subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to diﬀer materially from these
statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors
identiﬁed in our ﬁlings with the SEC, and you can review our full safe harbor
statement on our Investor Relations website at stock.walmart.com. With that, I'll pass
it to you, Doug.
Good afternoon, everybody. I appreciate you making the trip. It's good to see a lot of
familiar faces. I've missed this. I hope that you enjoyed coming back and doing it
again.
I'll start with introductions and then make a couple of comments, and then we'll
open it up for questions. I'll start up here. Suresh Kumar, as I think you all know, leads
our technology areas, continue to do an outstanding job building a really strong
team and getting a lot done.
Judith McKenna, as you know, leads our International team. She probably doesn't
have much hearing left after this week, it's been so fun. Brett Biggs got the longest
hug today. Unless any of you want to set a new record, come up at the end and hug
Brett more.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
No.
I appreciate Brett for lots of things, and I've talked about that a lot lately. But one of
the things I appreciate is the way he's handled this transition. I didn't want Brett to
transition at this point, but he was ready to do that, but he was gracious enough to
work with us over a period of time to create a very smooth transition plan and a very
transparent plan, which I appreciate, which led to the hire of John David Raney,
who's sitting over here to the right, John, if you'd stand up?
I think it's June 6, three days from now, that you become the oﬃcial CFO of the
company. So you guys can ask him questions too, if you want. He doesn't know
anything. This is really his -- is this week two? Week two.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Page 4 of 29Here's John Furner. John leads Walmart U.S., but as you know, he's led Sam's, lived
in China for us, done a lot for the company.
Kath McLay, who leads our Sam's Club business here in the U.S., it's exciting to have
a meeting where you can make one of these big presentations, Kath. You did a great
job today.
Seated over at this table, we have Donna Morris, who leads our people team; and
Rachel Brand, if you guys would stand up? Donna First? Rachel Brand leads our
governance areas. Dan Bartlett leads corporate aﬀairs, sustainability in other areas.
And we've got a bunch of other Walmart people around, other Walmart and Sam's
Club leaders.
You guys can just raise your hand, a bunch of people in the back that if you ask us
really diﬃcult questions, we'll drag them into the process. And I won't introduce
them all. We did not enjoy the ﬁrst quarter.
We were, as we've said, kind of surprised by the pace of change and the magnitude
of cost impact kind of middle of the quarter on. We faced inﬂationary pressures kind
of throughout the income statement. Top line was in pretty good shape. As we
mentioned, we do see some changes with some really value-conscious customers as
we mentioned. We'll see how that plays out quarter-to-quarter.
Not a lot has changed since we released our results. So we'll probably repeat a lot of
what we shared at that time, but we'll see how we go as we go through the Q&A.
And we're focused on keeping the top line going. We do care about units and
dollars. We'll track baskets, units, market share. We'll look at all those metrics to
evaluate our own performance as we look ahead. And then we've been working
really hard on costs, top to bottom, taking action to get our costs down so that the
second quarter looks better than the ﬁrst quarter, and then we're on our way. It will
take a little bit of time to work through the inventory, and we have more inventory
than we want, and we'll talk more speciﬁcally about that during the Q&A, I'm sure.
We didn't, as shareholders, enjoy that process. We're all very vested and care a lot
about what happens with the share price. But we are long-term thinkers. We care
about the short term. We manage the short term. And then over the last few weeks,
in particular, you saw the team react in a very detailed and aggressive way. Some
people inside the company kind of called it old-school Walmart.
I mean, that's a complement to me, we still know how to run a retail business down
to the granular level, and when pressured, that's what happened. But we have a
great strategy. We're excited about how the business model itself is changing.
We can build a more proﬁtable company. Some of the things that we've started are
really encouraging, and that will result in a better bottom line as we continue to haveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

A - Douglas McMillontop line that grows and earn share and earn the favor of customers and members,
which is our goal. So we don't really see anything strategically that concerns us.
We just want to go faster to get those things done as we manage the short-term
pressures, which seem to change fairly frequently. It's a very ﬂuid environment. And
obviously, the pandemic was a signiﬁcant change, and there were things that
happened within that pandemic period and racial equity and other things that
occurred.
And now we're staring a diﬀerent set of circumstances in the face, and we'll adjust to
those just as we do the other ones. Dan, with that, I'll open it up to questions from
you.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
All right. Great. Well, we had lunch with Lior Suchard, so we already know what their
questions are. We're prepared. We'll go to Robby Ohmes with Bank of America.
Robby?
{BIO 1541955 <GO>}
Robby Ohmes, Bank of America. I just -- I have one question, but as many of you up
there would be willing to comment on it, I'd be really grateful because it's kind of a
question I'm getting a lot and you're probably not going to answer it as much as I
would want you to.
So in this scenario, that inﬂation remains very elevated and kind of broadly elevated,
what is the outlook in proﬁtability for discretionary versus grocery. So you've had
some proﬁtability issues in discretionary very recently in the ﬁrst quarter, but it seems
like grocery and consumables has held up.
What is the thought process? Can grocery get less proﬁtable like discretionary has?
Can it get more proﬁtable in an inﬂationary environment like this? Is there some
balance between discretionary versus grocery? Anything each of you could tell me
to ﬁgure out this puzzle would be wonderful.
Yes. Would you just go ahead and give us the answers to the puzzle, that would help
a lot. I'll kick it oﬀ kind of generally and then, John, you and Judith and Kath and
Brett and others can chime in if you want to.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 29A - John FurnerWe make money in food, and we make money in fresh food and that mix of fresh to
dry grocery is another dimension to keep an eye on. And I do worry sometimes
when we talk about market share growth in grocery that somehow there's a
shorthand that, that means there could be margin pressure.
We make money in fresh food and in dry grocery. And we can manage inﬂation in
those areas. General merchandise, apparel, seasonal hard lines, home, those are all
really important, both in stores and online.
And so -- yes, we care about growing those. But getting the inventory level right is
one of the keys to success. When you get too much, you get too mark downs, you
get too much handling. You get too little and you don't have enough to really drive
the margin mix.
So -- and we'll talk more about inventory, maybe we can just address it now. To me,
that's the key when I think about getting the mix right over time, more so than just
how the customer or member responds to the environment.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Robby, let me pick up inventory point. And if you look at the end of the ﬁrst quarter,
we were up a little over 32%. And if you step back and somewhat break that at heart,
there's probably 20% of it, if you could just wish away and make it disappear, you
would. But there were some really healthy improvements in there as well.
About 1/3 of the increase, roughly 1/3 was getting us back into the position you want
to be in for customers, be back in stock. So remember, the year before, we had
stimulus that helped in general merchandise and throughout the pandemic there
were categories, some frequently some infrequently that were just out of stock and
hard to get to.
So that was important. And then there was the impact of inﬂation as well. So when
you put all that together, I think our team and many of them are here today have
done a great job really since the middle of the quarter. when the cost came through
and really the inventory came through pretty quickly as well as ports and containers
and things move really at a pace we haven't seen in the last couple of years. that will
happen.
They've done a great job of getting inventory moved out into our distribution
centers or fulﬁllment centers through the import network. So we're working on the
positioning. I think it's going to take this quarter and probably part of next, maybe a
couple of quarters would be the best way to describe it, to get back to where we
want to be.
And some of the inventory that is here, we brought forward because of the long lead
times we were seeing at port. So we do have some of our late Q2 and Q3 inventory
already here, which will help us over the long term. So we'll continue to work
through this. But I think it's a couple of quarters.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 29A - Douglas McMillon
A - John Furner
A - Kathryn McLay
A - Douglas McMillonAnd the thing Doug said that's important, when you look at the mix of not only the
supercenter, but the supercenter and ecommerce, the supercenter and ecommerce
and Marketplace, all across the entire business, then our merchants have a lot of
ﬂexibility in terms of what they lever and what they lever up and what they can lever
down if a customer chooses to buy other things.
So mix within categories is important, mix within food to fresh is important.
Consumables, it works the same way. And we mentioned in the ﬁrst quarter, we took
some markdowns in apparel. The weather was soft at that point. So we wanted to get
ahead of that and the rollbacks that we've put in the store. And if you walk the stores
or you go on the site, you'll see a big section of rollbacks.
Those are working, the customer is responding. So we're positioned, I think, really
well to serve customers given any change we see. If you look all the way back into
the early 2000s in diﬀerent markets, Walmart is positioned well to do a great job.
And the team -- as Doug said, I've really enjoyed the last few weeks, even though it
was hard and it wasn't the results you wanted. I've really enjoyed seeing how quickly
the team can respond and get all the way into the details run great stores, make
improvements on the website, some of them in an hour at times, they're moving
really quickly to stay ahead of this and make sure we're in great shape.
That 20% number you mentioned is the overage amount. Like, if we could snap our
ﬁngers and have part of our inventory go away, it'd be 20% of the overage, not 20%
of the total. Just to clarify that.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yes. The growth. That's exactly right.
{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
Yes. I would just say, like the last two years, we've seen phenomenal growth -- and
part of it was people had diﬀerent behaviors with Covid. They're at home, they're
doing up their backyards, they're eating at home and not going out to restaurants.
So we came into this year thinking, I wonder what's going to happen as we move
forward. Are we going to have people going back out to restaurants and traveling
and what would be the impact on sales?
Well right now with inﬂation, they're not going out to restaurants as much, and they
told us that they're not going to travel as much. And boy, we've got the inventory for
them. So what we're looking at is just how do you continue to be the place where
they want to shop because you're giving them great value.
One of the things about general merchandise too, that I mentioned is that they're
opening price points throughout the general merchandise out of store. We talkFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Q - Simeon Gutman
A - Brett Biggsabout it in terms of the store, there are tennis balls and sporting goods. There are
opening price point T-shirt items in ladies wear.
So managing where those get positioned and then thinking about other price points
that you may want to roll back to drive mix, that's another variable that we manage.
So units, traﬃc across the whole box, roll of rollbacks, roll of opening price points,
those are some of the variables that we manage. Anything you want to add?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
No. Just maybe the only thing I would say is one of the advantages that we have as a
company, and we see all of those across the markets and taking very similar actions
is that we have people across the market to have deep experience in inﬂationary
times.
We have -- one of our presidents is Brazilian another is Argentinian, our Chief
Merchant in Mexico is Argentinian. And that team have been gracious enough to
spend a lot of time with all of the other teams around the world, John, including your
team, merchants, operators, everybody, helping everybody understand one of the
things that you navigate through at these times and what levers you can pull and
what works, assuming short term, medium term, whatever that looks like.
They have experience of it, including on the other side of it as well. So one of the
powered-by-Walmart elements of this is we have people who know these
environments and help share that really far.
I sat through one of those clinics a couple of weeks ago, and it was awesome. And I
get reminded of some things that I had experienced when I moved into
International, the ﬁrst time in 1999, I got exposure to Brazil. And cooking oil was
going like this, like daily going up, and I had never seen anything like that before.
Their tactics are clear and helpful.
They are. And one of the things that Gui, who's our President in Mexico, he's
Brazilian, is focus the business on controlling the things that you can control and
spend your time there because that is actually how you'll get the best results.

Do I get one and a follow-up or -- I'll put them all in now. Doug, you said nothing has
really changed since we last spoke. Curious what type of consumer is assumed in
your guidance for the rest of the year. There are multiple headwinds, and they feel
like they're rising, not going down, you're maybe taking price -- gas prices are going
up, inﬂation in general. That's the ﬁrst question.
Yes. So if we think about the most value-conscious customer group, we're watching
that group, I'm kind of giving you a U.S. answer, but I think this is somewhat true
around the world. How is that group behaving and what do they need from us.
And as I mentioned during the call, we're thinking about opening price point items,
Charles Broadﬁeld is our Chief Merchant, sitting back here, for what they need to put
food on the table.
We mentioned the half gallon of milk story. But going through and looking at tuna,
mac and cheese -- you can shout out a few items if you want to, Charles, a group of
items that help a family put groceries on the table.
Rice, beans pasta.
So think about them, what do units look like? How many units in the basket, what
does inﬂation look like for them? And then as you move up the income scale, how
many of those customers can you attract in areas you might not have been doing
business with them as frequently. Can we move some volume into apparel and home
and maybe even some of the consumable categories as people become even more
value conscious.
And Dan was talking earlier about some surveys that he's seen that indicate that's
already happening. So that's the way we think about it is protect and serve help that
group that needs the most help, and then be attractive and attract others, whether
it's stores or ecommerce.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
I think I'd also add, Simeon, the beneﬁt Walmart has with being able to shop in the
store, be able to pick up the curb side, have things delivered and with Walmart+ and
limited delivery, we see take-up rates in all those channels, whether people are
trying to save time or just have someone bring it to their house for them.
So depending on where you are on the value spectrum, then there should be
something that we should be able to help each individual family and customer with.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

The follow-up is on pricing. All the retailers we follow, say that the price gaps are
essentially unchanged. And I don't know if that's true or not, do you debate leaning
into price? Would you communicate that to us even if you were? And how does your
philosophy change on price now?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Well, if you take a look at where we are now, the best way I would describe it is we're
about where we were when the pandemic began, and that was a strong price
position that we were proud of. And so we'll continue to watch price all along the
way.
And of course, we're going to manage costs. The thing that Doug said in the
beginning that we talk about a lot is we've got to keep the top line growing. What's
really important is that we are in-stock. We're running great stores.
Chris and Dakota and others have made what I think are pretty signiﬁcant
improvements in store standards over the last few months. In stock is -- it looks to me
to be the best it's been in a couple of years. Charles and the team have focused on
that. So we've got to keep the top line growing strong, and then we'll continue to
manage the value gap on costs that need to ﬂow through like cost of product or the
fuel or the shipping that takes to move those, we'll pass those through.
And what was diﬀerent in the ﬁrst quarter, there were some costs that came in really
quickly. And in some of those, we felt were more onetime in nature. And those did
not ﬂow through. So we'll continue to ﬂow through what we need to, to fairly price
and protect the margins where appropriate to make sure that our customers get the
right value versus the rest of the market.
When I think about investing in price, during a period like this, the ﬁrst thing I think
about is we know where our gaps need to be to grow proﬁtable market share.
Number two, investing in price doesn't necessarily translate to loyalty. There are
other thing could translate to loyalty longer term, even when we're not in this
inﬂationary period. We'd like to have more Walmart+ members.
We'd like to have more customers shop both stores and ecommerce. When
somebody shops both, as we've told you before, our share of wallet goes up and
they stick with us in a bigger way for a longer period of time, making investments in
things that might drive long-term value for the company, we're open to and
interested in. In the short term, trying to increase the price gap to have better short-
term performance that might not translate into long-term behavior, isn't really a
good investment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

A - Douglas McMillon{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
A good example -- Doug, I remember Robby, last time I saw you in New York, three
years ago, you asked about capacity pickup, and team has done just a fantastic job.
And it feels like every week now, they're ﬁnding new unlocks for more capacity, more
slots, more time available, more express shipping.
So I'm just really happy with the way that the team continues to just press boundaries
and ﬁnd new ceilings on the business.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Michael Lasser ﬁrst and then we'll go to Scott in the back after that.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
It's Michael Lasser from UBS. Two questions. Doug, one of your peers in the ﬁnancial
services industry recently described the macro as a looming hurricane. Do you share
that view? And as you're thinking about that, I'll ask my second question, which is, in
hindsight, some of the challenges that Walmart experienced in the ﬁrst quarter were
more systemic than idiosyncratic.
If this marks an inﬂection point transitioning from the last two years where
consumers were binging on the consumption of goods to now feeling that they can
spread their spending across a lot more categories at the same time, they're
experiencing more inﬂation and this puts downward pressure on the proﬁtability of
the retail sector more broadly, does that make it more challenging for Walmart to
achieve the greater than 4% operating income growth element of its algorithm?
Yes. Jamie has a way with words, and I'm a little diﬀerent. I probably wouldn't try to
coin a term. I am concerned about the inﬂation rate. And should it stay at this level or
go up and be there for a sustained period of time. I think that has a negative impact
on too many families, and I'm concerned about that.
As it relates to the other question, I think the business model change is real and puts
us in a good position to decide how much we want to invest to drive growth if we
need to and how much ﬂows to the bottom line in a way that we could not before.
So I think we just need to execute our strategy, we need to execute as quickly as we
can do it well. And that's what goes through my mind. And then the future will be
what it will be. If the world is under more pressure and people are generally more
value-conscious, we're the place to go.
If the world is a little more brighter than that and people can experience more
convenience than we've got delivery and we've got ecommerce and we've got
everything else. The world during the pandemic, where so much was spent on
goods and not on services was not a real world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

A - John FurnerThat was a temporary situation all along, and we know that. And I hope that people
can go on vacations and experience life in the way that we did before the pandemic
peacefully and happily as we hope and pray for. In either environment, we're going
to grow share and we're going to do it more proﬁtably over time.
And the four and four algorithm is one that we are excited about, committed to we
do say it's over time, and we've said from the beginning quarters, we week quarters,
but we think we can achieve that. And with a company of our size I think that's a
really good performance. So we're committed to that.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Scott, and then we'll go to Greg Melich after that.
{BIO 7138867 <GO>}
Yes. Scott Mushkin from R5 Capital. Way back here. So the ﬁrst question is actually
for John. We -- our research has shown just an enormous improvement in the store
operations and standards over the last year, kudos to your team for that. As the
economy changes, how do you protect that? Obviously, you had a lot of money to
invest. And as we move forward, how do you protect that?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yes. Scott, thanks for the question. When you go back a couple of years, there were a
number of impacts. Doug mentioned a few this morning. We had divisions of the
store close. We're moving people around to keep stores open. And there were some
times that were pretty tough, and I want to commend my store teams for all that they
did the pandemic they showed up and they served communities.
In the last probably year, even more than just the last few months, the team have
been working on a lot to make stores and supply chain all work together.
So we've put Chris Nicholas in the role that he's in as the Chief Operating Oﬃcer,
who has everything from import delivery, all the way to in-home delivery into
refrigerators into people's homes. So we took the opportunity to step back and
make sure that all the operations are all working to a very common goal, which is the
end of the Walmart year, the customer is number one, and ensuring that each of
those teams are delivering on customer metrics.
We start all of our meetings with NPS scores and how does the customer feel and
we're really focused on in-stock availability in every one of the channels. Probably
the third point that's important is the amount of digital innovation that's happening
in the stores for the associates, I think it's making a big diﬀerence.
It's probably about 1.5 years ago, we put about 1 million devices in people's hands.
Since that point, we've been taking all the processes and technology they need and
putting it on that device so that when an associate walks in, to work, they clock in onFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

A - Douglas McMillontheir device and then everything they need is right there in their hands to try to save
them time and make it easier for them to be productive.
And then the last thing I'd say, the team has done a really nice job with the regional
managers, the divisional managers, market managers, store managers of making
sure that they feel like they are an owner of the store. We've had a number of
listening sessions with those groups, and we list them and close it out.
We've got digital listing tools where we get 10 million questions a week. If we listen
to those and we go develop things that make ease for -- just this week, we had 3,000
associates we had listening sessions with.
So -- we're really focused, Scott, on making sure that the associates are heard, the
things that they need, we get in front of them and then our product and tech teams
are working as quickly as possible to develop solutions to make them be in the best

Perfect. And my follow-up question was around automating the picking process, the
MFCs. Any quick update you can give us on that?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yes. Excited about the work there. We've got a couple of places in the country, New
Hampshire, Northwest Arkansas, Dallas, where we have sites that are in construction
and ready to go. As we work through remodels, I'm really happy with the remodel
program and some of the changes they're making. But in the facilities that need
MFCs, we're going ahead another building on the space, getting the space clear.
So the idea of having a supply chain that's upstream, more automated and can
deliver everything from the regional cases, refrigerator cases from automated
equipment that's picked and ready for the aisle in the store or the fulﬁllment center, I
think it's going to make a big diﬀerence.
The team really has spent probably the last 18 months working with each of the were
pretty static supply chains, a perishable supply chain and e-com supply chain and an
ambient supply chain.
And they've worked out a number of ways to ensure that the product ﬂows. We
consolidate early, we can deconsolidate as late as possible, which is the store, the
curb. So just a lot of great work in the supply chain. I think I'm spending some time
with you next few weeks. So looking forward to showing you a store.
When you think about the market fulﬁllment centers, I would call out automated
storage and retrieval systems and then also that we have automated storage andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

perishable distribution centers as well as the MFCs.
That technology, which, in some cases, we had relationships with start-ups to
progress has all kind of in the last year or so, gotten to the point where we have high
conﬁdence that productivity and the numbers that they're supposed to hit, we will hit
and deliver.
And we're really excited about what that means throughout the supply chain cost-
wise, productivity-wise, but also as it relates to the associate experience back to
having high store standards. When you have a pallet that comes in that's more often
already department ready and on a pallet instead of a four-stacked ambient load, it's
a dramatically diﬀerent job.
And it helps us in a number of ways as it relates to inventory management and
accuracy, too. So that's an exciting part of our future.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
We'll go to Greg next, then Peter, and then Chris.
Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. I'll start with my follow-up, actually maybe for Charles.
What are we planning units for fourth quarter this year given the supply chain
challenges we have, but then also the extra inventory we have now? Are we buying
to up units or down units for fourth quarter?
Yes. Charles, we're all done to here. I don't know if that's a question you even can
answer because we usually don't buy in, in units, but do you -- John, why don't you
go ﬁrst?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yes. Let me start. Certainly, Greg, there are categories that we're excited about in the
third and fourth quarter. And this -- while we see some customers in the value
segment switching some, this is still -- it's a big economy.
There's a lot of money out there. There's a lot of consumption. And there are
important categories like toys, electronics, Christmas where it's important that we do
a great job and win on behalf of the customer.
Second, really excited about the work that Tom Moore and the ecommerce team are
doing, not only in the -- with 1P and enabling the entire system to deliver them half
the customer, but also the growth in the marketplace. I think they've got a lot of
exciting innovation there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Page 15 of 29Q - Gregory Melich
A - Douglas McMillonThird, the last point you made, while I said a bit earlier that there deﬁnitely is going
to be some inventory we'll work through over the next couple of quarters. In places,
we'll -- we've been really thoughtful and we're planning what we need to continue to
buy, what we could slow down a bit or what we need to continue to remain
aggressive with.
I did say -- and -- this fact that we did bring in some of our Q2, Q3 inventory that's
already here. So I think we'll adjust as those lead times adjust. And what we saw in
the last two years as lead times expanded, because the ports backed up and then
what we saw in early February is a lot of that came through and it came through
much quicker. You see that across the entire country and the industry, but a lot of
that came through quickly, which, in many cases, can help us with share in growth.
So that was my follow-up. So if I could then, my question is sort of a bigger picture. I
think, Doug, we were talking a little bit before that the business model has changed
a lot and the company well-positioned through Covid, it's actually amazing, right,
what's happened, how you guys got through it.
But I remember that growing traﬃc and transaction counts was a real part of the turn
I'd say, ﬁve, six years ago. But now we're probably running high single-digit
transaction counts down from pre-Covid. So given how the business models change,
the growth of ecommerce, items and basket.
Should we expect traﬃc to not grow going forward? Could it -- is there a scenario
where it would actually be ﬂat or slightly down and it still makes sense and successful
just because the basket is growing and people doing more click and collect and
more ecommerce? Like, how do we think about traﬃc as part of the business model
now?
It's so interesting isn't because it's multidimensional now in a way that it wasn't
because of the way ecommerce is playing out. There are pickup orders, there's
delivery orders, there's traﬃc walking into the store, just as there always was. And I
think transaction count is a good measure of the health of a retailer over time, that
total transaction count.
But we've been trying to position the company everywhere to be a bit indiﬀerent as
it relates to how people want to shop. If they want to pick up order, great, if they
want a delivery, great, they want a diﬀerent kind of delivery, great, if they want to
come to the store, great. And we think families are going to do all the above.
And when you add it all up, I would just encourage you to look more than one
metric. Track units, look at units per basket, look at the size of the basket, look at how
many are ecommerce, how many are stores, look at share, and then decide how you
think things are going.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Q - Peter Benedict

A - Kathryn McLay
A - John FurnerFor example, if you just take transactions. Another question you would ask would be,
what share of transactions did you get, if transactions are down a little, but your
share of transactions went up then that's good. And if transactions are down
because they went to ecommerce because something happened like a pandemic, all
that's got to be factored into the way that we think about it.
But the punchline is, yes, we want transactions to go up. And we want to design, we
think we are designing a business model that works, whether those are store
transactions or some other form of transaction.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Great. And we'll go to Peter.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Peter Benedict at Baird. So ﬁrst question on labor. Curious what you're seeing in
terms of labor availability trends there the cost of labor, what kind of your outlook is
over the balance of the year and into next year? That's my ﬁrst question.
Yes. Why don't you two both take that one to start?
{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
Sure. So about six months into last year, we totally revamped the way that we hire
people so that we could hire them within a 24-hour period. We've also been
investing in wage rate over the last couple of years. We're now at a minimum of $15.
We're probably on average more of like $17.40.
I think those two things together has meant that we've been at full employment
pretty much for the last six months. And that doesn't mean that we don't have
pockets. So you're still looking at like geographies or particular like TBC -- time
battery skills, et cetera. So you're still in markets trying to ﬁnd kind of solutions. But
pretty much across the board, we've been at full employment. We're not seeing that
as being a barrier for us at hand.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yes. Ours is similar says, and then there are probably a couple of diﬀerences to
mention. For the most part, through the pandemic, we overscheduled and we ran a
little under. We proved a couple of points under what we scheduled for most of the
last two years.
And then as we got into the end of January and February, a number of people leave
as Omicron moved all across the country at a pretty fast rate. And then in February,
we had quite a surge of people that came to work probably one that I've never seen
anything like for a few weeks.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Page 17 of 29Q - Peter Benedict
A - Suresh KumarSo the team made adjustments over time. We worked that through with attrition and
scheduling out for a few weeks. And I'd say by the end of the quarter, late March,
middle of April, end of April, I think we feel really good about our staﬃng levels. Still
some pockets, of course, where we may be over under, we'll ﬁnd that as we look
across the country map.
And then the same thing on wages. We made a number of investments during the
pandemic. We've made geographic investments, and we'll continue to make those
in facilities where we need to because we want to make sure that we are
appropriately staﬀed. Supply chain also feel really good about staﬃng levels all
across the country, really end to end.
And I'm been -- going to say this again, I'm just really happy with -- thankful for the
team the way that they work through all the containers and everything and it has
gotten us in a position where we can say we think in a couple of quarters, we'll sell
through. But generally speaking, we feel good about where the staﬃng is right now.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
My other question, just around Walmart Global Tech. Maybe just some comments on
what are the most impactful initiatives there that maybe we should expect to see
impact the business over the next 12 to 24 months?
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
Yes. Over the last few years, we have been really investing in all of those
technologies in global tech that truly are going to transform the entire retail
experience from the customer experience to what we see, the tools that we give to
our associates so that they can be more eﬃcient so that they can serve the
customers better to all the way to how we run our business processes, more
automated, more optimized, making use of machine learning, making it a lot more
continuous improvement.
So we've been investing pretty much throughout the stack, from the infrastructure
layer, where we are investing in sort of the best of public cloud, private cloud,
bringing it all together, data and demo to our app layer where we are bringing in
things like voice, AR, AR/VR, natural language processing. All of these things are
coming together.
Ultimately, the idea is we want to deliver friction-free delightful experiences for our
customers. We want to make sure that our associates are focused on helping our
customers as eﬃciently and as eﬀectively as possible. And we want to make sure that
the business processes are automated, optimized and continuously learning. So
that's the vision.
With these investments that are already in way, you'll start seeing that already --
whether it is customer experience. John talked about some of the investments in
terms of consumer-grade tools that we are putting out to the associates, all of those
things are going to continue to accelerate.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

It's maybe worth saying, Suresh, as well, you and the team have been focusing on
trying to see where we can build global platforms.
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
That's right.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
From scratch, the glass would be a good example of that.
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
Yes. Glass is a platform that we have used for the customer app, which brings the
omni experience together. We launched that last year. And that is serving as a
platform on which we are now building all customer experience, and not just for the
U.S., but we are doing it for other international for Mexico. And we'll start developing
more functionality on that.
So where -- what due to -- talking about is that a possible we are building
leverageable, multi-tenanted platform so that you build it once, and then you
customize it for diﬀerent scenarios.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Okay, we'll go to Chris Horvers and then Renato.
{BIO 7499419 <GO>}
Chris Horvers, JPMorgan. So my ﬁrst question is also a follow-up. Have you seen any
bottom-of-funnel eﬀect in your customer base where they're looking to economize
on miles driven and gas and maybe average check, not average price? And if you do
see it, how would that aﬀect your pricing strategy?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
And one of the things that we did just recently, for example, Walmart+ members, we
increased the fuel discount. And we've seen a take up there that's been helpful.
Traﬃc was solid in Q1. I think that was pretty straightforward.
We are seeing some customers use Plus more frequently. And in some cases, we do
there for through an vital feedback that, that is having a delivery made versus driving
to the store. So I think over time, having this inﬂation impact in energy and fuel is not
helpful. It obviously hurts the customer and their spending power over time.
But I think we'll have to just continue to monitor everything from the way people are
spending on energy, transportation, food, by value chain and -- or by value tier of the
customer group and adapt.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 19 of 29Q - Christopher Horvers
A - John Furner
A - Daniel BinderFortunately, we're well-prepared to be able to handle any of those. A couple of
things that I think are interesting though, are the diﬀerent ways the team have
learned to develop and we've got a last mile team in the last mile business, that
continues to grow and oﬀer new ways that we can deliver. We've got some
interesting experience with drone deliveries.
We've got electric vans that are consolidating orders. So what we're trying to do,
over time, Tom and the team that originally built all this is that they build density in
neighborhoods for delivery, then we can take more in a single load. And that will
enable us to lower our cost per delivery, which ultimately helps power the ﬂywheel
or costs go down, we can keep the value right for the customer and oﬀer more
values to the customer.
{BIO 7499419 <GO>}
And so my follow-up is, given the store base, how do you think about the need to
get to next-day delivery availability for the 70 million, 80 million, 90 million SKUs that
sit in a fulﬁllment center and ship direct to home? Is that a goal of Walmart U.S. over
time? And does the three- to ﬁve-year supply chain plan get you to that?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
We haven't said the number of items that we intend for same day or next day. But
generally speaking, we have around 3,700 stores that can deliver the entire
assortment that's in the store, same day. And we couldn't have said that two years
ago, it would have been just a part of the assortment.
On the 1P business, ﬁrst party, we made pretty signiﬁcant improvements in the
amount of the assortment that is delivered next day, and that will continue to
improve. And then the last one that I'm, I think, most energized about as you look
out over time, is being able to use the store locations as cross docks for ecommerce
orders to ﬂow through, be consolidated with grocery orders, local orders and
ecommerce orders and move out.
We've done a lot in the last two years, and it really started -- I'm thinking (inaudible),
maybe in the middle of 2020, enabling ecommerce orders to be handed oﬀ to a
store that's closed. We started those in the beginning. We would ship those by a
post or a third party.
And then as the pandemic went on and we developed more capabilities, those
became same-day orders. So one of the things that we need to improve on is there
are a lot of orders where we'll tell you it will be here in two days, you order it, and it's
here in a couple of hours.
So we're delighting customers, I think, in an unexpected way. So that's given us the
conﬁdence to start lowering those times and telling customers it will be today or it
will be tomorrow and bringing the windows down.

Page 20 of 29Q - Renato Basanta
A - John FurnerGood. Renato?
{BIO 16418108 <GO>}
Renato Basanta, Barclays. So I just wanted to follow up on the pricing discussion
because clearly, Walmart has a history of advocating or being an advocate for the
consumer in terms of keeping prices as low as possible, and that's needed -- very
much needed at this point in time.
But at the same time, your CPG partners, vendors, they're having their own pressures
in terms of inﬂation. They're talking about protecting their own margin structures.
And there was a recent quote in the Wall Street Journal where a large CPG partner
of yours talked about protecting margins. And so -- but just wondering how you're
thinking about that dynamic playing out going forward?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Well, let me start with customers, and then I'll talk about the margins at the same
time. First, we have a -- well, as of July 2, a 60-year history of delivering prices that
are trustable, valuable. Less time than 60 years, but for a number of decades, having
what is known as everyday low price. And being able to have a basket of goods --
and it's not always every item every day, but basket of goods that you can trust, you
will ﬁnd a value on that basket at Walmart is really important to us.
And we spend a bit of time every week looking at where we are versus the market to
ensure that customers can trust Walmart for a value, and we won't stop doing that.
The way that we have moved inﬂation through back to Q1, things happened much
quicker than we thought.
We have a process where we will evaluate all the costs that are associated with
moving goods, receiving goods, putting in the store and then pricing against that.
Some of those changes happened faster than we thought. We've readjusted how
quickly we want to make those kinds of adjustments. So the emergency, the full cost.
And those would include the cost that need to move through and we'll price to
those. And then as far as suppliers, we've got a very wide range of suppliers, and
there are certain suppliers that have taken one line, others that are working with us
to ﬁnd ways to reduce costs even in time when costs are going up.
Just this week, Charles has been updating me on a number of suppliers who are
working with us to ﬁnd ways to ensure that the price doesn't go up. And in some
cases, I'm really impressed with the even come down. And we need to do that for
the American consumer at a time when they're pressured.
They're pressured on energy and fuel and other things that I want to go to the whole
list, even not they are. it is exciting to see that even in times when it looks like there'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Q - Rupesh Parikh
A - John Furnerinﬂation everywhere, there are ways to cut costs out of the system, be more eﬃcient
and deliver better value.
So when you're in a store, you'll see a number of rollbacks now that I'm really proud
of that are across the entire assortment. Everything from general merchandise into
food, and we're going to continue to do that.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. We'll go to Rupesh, next, then Bobby.
{BIO 15915617 <GO>}
Rupesh Parikh, Oppenheimer. So the ﬁrst one is on Walmart+. So clearly, the
consumer environment is going to be more -- potentially more diﬃcult going
forward.
So how does that impact -- how do you guys think about adoption of Walmart+ in a
more challenging environment? And as you look at retention, are there additional, I
guess, beneﬁts you can add to the oﬀering? So I'm just curious, any thoughts there.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
I think the retention will be strong and the ability to attract more customers in
Walmart+ will be strong as long as the value prop is strong. Number one, for a
monthly price, for an annual price, we have a delivery program that oﬀers an
unlimited delivery to people.
And early on, it was tough because we launched it at a time when we had some
availability issues, and we had some process issues that left customers at times
frustrated because the entire order wasn't delivered or it was late. And if you're
sitting in our meetings, you just hear Chris and the team and everyone working
through each part of that NPS to ensure that we are making the necessary
improvements so that customers don't have that frustration.
There will likely always be some kind of, at least for the foreseeable future, some kind
of substitution that happens at shelf. So we're working on things like two-way
communication, so that customers can talk back and forth with the person pulling
their order.
Our times have come down, our wait times have come down. So the performance, I
think, is encouraging. So the second thing you said, Plus also oﬀers people the
ability to use Scan & Go in stores to save time, something that's really popular at
Sam's and was developed at Sam's, which they've done a wonderful job improving.
And then ﬁnally, on other beneﬁts, we just raised in a lot of states, the fuel discount
for $0.05 to $0.10 per gallon. I think that's an appropriate discount given the time
and then we'll continue to evaluate other things that we may want to put in theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

event that has a number of deals online that went live last evening.
The stores are really ﬁred up about signing people up and communicating value. We
made all of our associates Plus members. So their experience and the value -- but a
lot of energy there, and I'm excited about it.
We'd like to use special purchases for those so that we're not running counter to the
EDLP. It's an item we carry all the time. We're trying to drive consistency as much as
possible, but a onetime purchase on something is also exciting.
{BIO 15915617 <GO>}
Yes. Okay. Okay. Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So obviously,
after you guys reported a number of retailers ended up with too much inventory. So
just curious, comfort with your gross margin outlook just given really even more
inventory out there and more retailers having to take markdowns.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
We were oﬀ 38 basis points in the ﬁrst quarter. And I think what that tells you -- and
there were some apparent markdowns that were included in that number. I think
what it shows you is the team's ability to manage margins across a wide portfolio of
categories. whether it's fresh food, grocery, consumables, apparel, general
merchandise, hardlines, ecommerce.
And then the derivative -- or I should say derivative, they're not derivative business,
they're actually great businesses that we're growing on the site, like advertising, our
data service business. There are a lot of things that are happening that are helping
Walmart position itself well so that our income statement is more diversiﬁed over
time.
That progress is exciting, and I think we'll be able to tell you more and more about
that in the future as it continues to grow. But we'll continue to manage this quarter-
to-quarter. I think it's -- as I said, I'll just say it one more time. It's probably another
couple of quarters until we manage the inventory down to a level that we're going to
be happy with.
It will still be up on last year. We still had out-of-stocks last year. We have some
inﬂation built into the inventory numbers. It's just that 20% of the increase that we
need to work through and get out of the system.

supply chain dynamics and stuﬀ with inﬂation. But U.S. entering environment -- or
already in it, where inﬂation is running a lot higher than the last decade. Has that
changed the desire for Walmart to further integrate into the supply chain to really be
able to control cost better than maybe where you're thinking about over the last 10
years? And really, kind of, I guess, on the transportation side or even on the grocery
side, kind of across the organizations where the question is.
We've done a little bit of that, but the thing that comes to mind ﬁrst is the
automation of the supply chain, the automation that goes into the centers to drive
productivity that way, more so than additional vertical integration.
{BIO 17061746 <GO>}
Okay. And then follow-up wise, Sam's Club. The performance over the last couple of
years has been tremendous. So just curious maybe talk a little bit about what the
next leg of growth is for Sam's.
Are we back to kind of maybe some potential club growth, membership fee
increases, anything there just now that the business is really operating at a very high
level?
{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
Yes. I think what we've seen over the last couple of years is the Club, which was
traditionally just for walk-in traﬃc is now -- ﬁlls multiple channels. So -- we're seeing
growth in the foot traﬃc coming in, but we now obviously have curbside and we're
into our second year of growth in that. We've got ship from Club, that's also kind of
growing.
And now we're just leveraging Walmart Go Local for delivery. And that was launched
just pre-Christmas, and we didn't put a lot of marketing behind it because we
wanted to build up that muscle. So we wanted to make sure that we're always going
to delight members when they get that delivery from the Club, and that's delivery
across kind of fresh, ambient -- kind of -- basically any item in the Club.
And so I think what we're seeing is that the boxes are becoming really productive by
serving all of those channels out of the one facility. That's where -- there's so much
organic growth out there for us. That's what we're focused on right now. But I don't
close my mind to potentially opening up facilities in the future, et cetera. But where's
a lot of growth like still left on the table for us.

Scott and Peter.
Simeon, up front.
{BIO 7138867 <GO>}
It's Scott Mushkin again from R5 Capital. So the question is regarding pricing and
how fast it's moving. It's more a psychology question for the consumer. Our surveys
would say maybe the consumer is losing its understanding of where price is
supposed to be. Do you think that plays into Walmart as its brand is so strong on
price? And do you anticipate that could actually -- you could gain a lot of share as
the year goes on? Does that make sense?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yes. Scott, I think back to a video I saw a long time ago, of a guy named Jack
Shewmaker, as some of you would remember, developing everyday low price using
spray paint. It was an item -- I think that you may remember the number better, but
like $1.29 a can, and it would go on sale for $0.79 and back to $1.29, and he just
pegged, I think it was $0.97 every day and ran it for years and years. That was
probably 1980, late 1970s. So that 40 years that we have with customers running
everyday low price, I do think builds trust.
And I do think it can give customers, in a very uncertain time, some ability to know
that we're focused on an everyday low price. We're going to keep our costs low.
Yes. We had some issues in the ﬁrst quarter. We're working through this. But we want
to keep our costs at a consistent level so that we build trust. And if we had to --
picked you, push too much through, too less through, we'll always lean on -- we've
got to make sure that we're doing the right things for customers with trust on pricing
over the time.
You mentioned 13-week period. If the 13 weeks had started sooner or later, things
would probably look diﬀerent, but they are what they are. And over time, we'll
continue to really work to developing prices that people trust so that we can get to
4% growth.
It's been my experience that customers know what's going on. And I think you're
right that because things have changed quickly, there may be some that are a little
up balance, but they'll ﬁgure it out quickly in an inﬂationary environment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Q - Simeon Gutman
A - John FurnerIf a lot of customers are paying even more attention to pennies. And so over time,
your reputation, the trust that you've earned only tracks reality. And so we just want
to keep earning it, Scott, so that when they do pay really close attention, it just
conﬁrms for them that we're the place they should shop.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Okay. We'll go to Simeon, and then back to Peter.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
I'll ask two quick ones. First, on ﬁntech, anything that we could talk about update, but
more importantly, on maybe buy now pay later, at least to -- things that could help
the consumer in this environment. That was the ﬁrst part.
Second is we haven't talked about e-com proﬁts or proﬁtability in a long time. And I
know we've moved the discussion away since it's integrated. But given that we think
there were material losses, any incremental improvement should be positive to the
story. So -- can we talk about either KPIs or directional improvement that the
business is making over time?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Okay. What if I take e-com, touch on ﬁntech, and maybe Judith do the same thing?
Ecommerce in stores, the reason that we haven't spoken as much about is, honestly,
it's just extremely hard to measure.
Seeing where the sales come from, that's a bit easier because you can tell someone
started in the store, they started on the app or they started on a desktop. But the
fulﬁllment channels are -- have just really blurred so much, it's really hard to tell.
We have stores that serve in-store customers. We have stores that do that and have
pickup and ship from store, and cross dock. And there are just so many things
moving all at the same time. We're looking at the cost per transaction. And then as a
result of all those transactions, we look at context that we get from customers to try
to make sure that our context for orders going down so that it's really ﬂuid and
friction free for the customer. Your ﬁrst question, which I'll come back to on ﬁntech.
We had a couple of acquisitions that we've announced. One Finance and Even. One
Finance is a really interesting, innovative start-up neobank for customers excited
about our strategy. We haven't begun integration just yet. We just made the
acquisition in April.
We also bought a company called Even, that is a platform where hundreds of
thousands of our associates ﬁnd value in saving and being able to pull money oﬀ
their paycheck. They've already accrued. So we'll put those together and come up
with a great oﬀer -- there was another, buy now pay later. We have a partner that we
use in store online with a ﬁrm, that's going well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Maybe just ﬁntech around the world. We see in our Walmex business, their Cashi
app that the team have developed, which is continuing to go from strength to
strength. They just completely relaunched that recently. And at the same time, you
heard Gui talking today about the development of the Bite which is the telecoms
oﬀer for customers as well.
So they're really thinking about how do you connect customers around the
ecosystem that Walmex is building. And Cashi is a really key part of that. And you'll
see them continue to build that out in the coming quarters and coming years,
probably our best-known ﬁntech business is PhonePe in India.
And you saw in the Q1 results, they're now reaching 800 billion of annualized TPV.
They are in nearly 30 million merchants across India. So they started when we very
ﬁrst talked to you about them, of course, about being a P2P business.
They've then expanded into merchants. And as they think about how they continue
to fund their growth levers for the future, they're really now leaning heavily into
insurance in two-wheeler and four-wheeler insurance, in particular.
So they're thinking about this at every stage of the consumer's life in India and how
do they play a part in that and be something the app gets ﬁred a remarkable
number of times, Leigh Hopkins, can you remember how many times the app gets
ﬁred?
{BIO 21415683 <GO>}
I can't give you a number. We are on 2.7 million transactions a month.
{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
That's right. These 3 billion transactions a month that they're now doing. So think
about the number of times the app is getting ﬁred.
So what they're looking to do is create use cases that sit behind that for the way that
they can further engage with the customer in the future. But they do some really
exciting work. We were in India recently and spent some time with the engineers
there, and I was just telling Suresh the other day, they're still building that scale they
have now of some of the original code that they wrote in the beginning. And it's now
able to handle that 3 billion transactions, which is extraordinary.
I think it's obvious, but I'll say just in case some people have haven't really focused
on this. We're trying to design for families, design for customers and members a
retail experience that has stores or clubs plus ecommerce in the various forms. And
that brings along with it a marketplace business, a fulﬁllment business and ad
business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

A - Unidentiﬁed Speakerand we're going further into healthcare in multiple countries and ﬁnancial services in
multiple countries. And so I think you can hear in our earnings script and this
conversation in other places, there commonalities of that connected ﬂywheel that
are happening across markets, which relates to the point that Suresh and Judith
were making about more global platforms, build it once, leverage across as many
countries as you can, adjusting for compliance diﬀerences if you need to.
That commonality is -- it's an interconnected relationship, kind of easy conceptually
to get but hard to design through an app or a site in other kind of digital forms that
will emerge in the future.
But it's so exciting. If you can turn one relationship, whether it comes through e-com
or stores or health and wellness or ﬁnancial services, all being top of funnel, into a
set of relationships where the other businesses become defaults, which in a digital
world, you can do better than you could in an analog world, you've got a more
valuable company.
And that's what we're trying to do. But we can't get all the businesses stood up at the
same pace. India is diﬀerent than the United States and stitching them together in a
way where everything is intuitive, requires change to where -- working, more design
mindset and diﬀerent skill sets in the company, which we've been adding to the
company.
Please ask the last question to Brett. I don't think he's gotten one yet. Peter, do you
have the mic?
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
And Peter, this will be our last question.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
You can ask me a really long-term question.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
That was a great wrap up there.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
I don't have an answer at this point. Well, for Brett, have you gotten sunglasses since
April or were you outside watching sporting events?
That's awesome. There's a famous photo of Brett that he does not want you to look
at, at a golf tournament where he's squinting and someone made fun of him, for
those of you who that don't know. Not that I want to further...
That is a ﬁtting end to 22 years right there, Peter.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

I was just going to ask Judith to maybe talk a little bit about China and the Chinese
consumer, but this just feels...
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
It’s not worth it after that is it?
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
If there's nothing so -- we can wrap it up.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, listen, those of you at the meeting today heard me give a call out to the
Walmart China team. You'll all be following events there in the lockdowns that have
been happening, particularly at Shanghai.
The single focus of our team is making sure that we can serve customers in some
way there -- and as things have taken a challenging turn, the team has pivoted
entirely into ecommerce. And for many people, the thing they've been most
interested in is how do they get food to their homes, whilst they've been locked
down.
And if -- Peter, just give you an example of how the team have been handling that.
Usually, we have about 2,500 associates across our stores and clubs working in
Shanghai across the clubs that we have there. We have ﬁve stores and three clubs.
And at one point, we had just 170 people working, and we still managed to keep the
ecommerce business running serving and pivoting heavily into fresh fruit and
vegetables for people, less so in the other categories, but doing that. So the team
are doing an utterly tremendous job there, and we continue to give them all the
support that we can.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
That will end our Q&A session. Did you want to keep going?
Yes. I'll close. But do you want to have anything you want to share before I do that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Today is a weird day. It's -- in 22 years, almost seven years in this role. And the
great thing for Walmart is it's such a great company, such a great role, but it's easy to
attract really good people, and John David, you have that, who's coming in. So I
know you'll enjoy work with him.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

A - Unidentiﬁed SpeakerBut this was my ﬁrst CFO gig when I started this 6.5 years ago, and I got to know a
lot of you for the ﬁrst time during that period. And over the years, I've gotten to
know you even more. You've been helpful to me. You've been helpful with the
questions you asked. You've been helpful to the company with the questions you
asked because it makes us better.
And you know our company really well. And to a person, you've always been fair,
and that's all you can ask, I think, from sitting in my chair, but I've really enjoyed
working with you. I know I'll see some of you as I move on. But the company is in a
fantastic position. You can tell the leadership team is strong.
People have asked, if it's so great, why are you leaving right now, and that is because
it's never over at Walmart. There's never an end, it always keeps going. But when I
look at the next three, four, ﬁve years, the upside I see for this company is unlimited.
And then Greg, you asked about the business model. The business model is exactly
what we need to be doing. The strategy is right, and I know we're going to execute. I
know that for certain because I've seen it in my entire career. So I feel great about
Walmart.
I'll just add my gratitude and say thank you for coming. Thank you for paying
attention to the company, those of you who are listening or those of you that are
here in person. We can manage the short term while we build for the long term, and
that's what we're going to do. Thank you all.
Great. Thank you.
