Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today.
This is Corey duBrowa. I am the Senior Vice President of Global Communications for
Starbucks Coﬀee Company.
The purpose of today's call is to discuss the news we announced today regarding
Starbucks leadership appointments. We will have opening remarks from bothFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-01

Before I turn the call over to Howard I would like to remind you that this conference
call may include forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and
uncertainties that could cause our actual results to diﬀer materially from these
statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with
cautionary statements and risk factor discussions in our ﬁlings with the SEC including
our last annual report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any
of these forward-looking statements or information.
This conference call is being webcast. And an archive of that webcast will be
available on our website at investor.Starbucks.com until January 3, 2017.
Finally, a quick housekeeping note on Q&A. We would ask that you limit your
questions to today's news as the extended management team will be providing a
detailed review of our strategic plan at our Investor Day next Wednesday in New
York.
With that I would like to turn the call over to Howard. Howard?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Thank you, Corey. Welcome to everyone joining us on today's call. Kevin and I are
very excited to have this opportunity to provide additional context around this
afternoon's announcement and to answer any questions you might have.
You may recall that it was three years ago that I shared with you what I sensed were
the early signs of a seismic shift in consumer behavior away from bricks and mortar
and towards mobile and online retailing. Today that shift has taken ﬁrm hold around
the world, both disrupting and redeﬁning retailing and signiﬁcantly reducing the
consumer foot traﬃc that traditional retailers have relied on for decades.
Despite the shift, Starbucks has been able to consistently outperform the retail
industry. We have able to do so because our stores, our oﬀerings and the
experiences our partners create make us a destination and because we invested way
ahead of the curve to create world-class mobile, loyalty and digital capabilities that
are enabling us to deliver an increasingly elevated Starbucks experience to our
customers.
Evidence of the correctness and the success of the core strategy that is driving our
business are the facts that we continue to deliver quarter after quarter of record
industry-leading revenue, comps sales and proﬁt growth and that each successive
new class of Starbucks stores is delivering record-breaking revenues, AUVs, ROI,
both in the US and around the world. This trend was repeated most recently in the
2016 ﬁscal year that just ended.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-01
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 15I also shared with you that the US was over-retailed. To survive let alone succeed
traditional bricks and mortar retailers have to evolve their physical spaces into
relevant customer destinations as Starbucks stores have been for the last 40 years
through the environments and sense of community that we create.
That view is what inspired the development of the Starbucks Roastery and the
Starbucks Reserve brand. Since its opening two years ago the almost 20,000 square
foot Seattle Roastery has become widely recognized as most immersive coﬀee-
forward retail experience perhaps in the world. Executives from premier global
retailers like Apple, Nike and Zara have shared with me their view that the Roastery
delivers the best retail experience in or out of coﬀee that they have ever
encountered.
Our Roastery is attracting customers and visitors to Seattle alike and casting a bright
halo across the entire Starbucks global brand and ecosystem. With the Roastery we
introduced into the coﬀee category a previously unattained level of premium
amortization. Its success is unparalleled, last year achieving a comp sales increase of
24% and delivering a ticket that is four times the ticket of a typical Starbucks store.
The Roastery has become a learning laboratory for breakthrough innovation and
experiential design and a beacon for the next wave of Starbucks global growth and
evolution. Going forward we will open at least 20 Roasteries around the world, six by
the end of calendar 2019 alone.
At the same time, elements of the Roastery are forming the basis of the 1,000 or
more Starbucks Reserve stores we will be opening around the world in the years
ahead. Starbucks Reserve is a new premium retail coﬀee format that will showcase
the newest coﬀee brewing methods and oﬀer customers the ﬁnest assortment of
exclusive micro-lot coﬀees sourced from around the world in and all a sensory
experience emblematic of our Seattle Roastery fared with artisanal food oﬀerings
developed with our partners from Italian artisanal baker, Princi. We expect Starbucks
Reserve stores to deliver twice the unit economics of the typical Starbucks store.
We will also add Reserve bars into thousands of existing Starbucks stores over time.
Let me explain what a reserve bar is and what it is going to me to the Company. The
Roastery has taught us and demonstrated that we can create customized,
handcrafted, innovative beverages for our customers using cutting edge brewing
methods and proﬁtably delivering them at scale.
Over time you will see us introduce this unique capability into thousands of existing
Starbucks stores around the world, further elevating the Starbucks experience we
deliver to our customers and further extending the halo that the Roastery casts
across the entire Starbucks brand. Like our current stores and the new classes of
Starbucks stores, we will be opening globally in the years to come Roasteries,
Reserve stores and Reserve bars that will be customer destination venues. They will
broaden, deepen and elevate our customer experience and represent an
unprecedented new global growth opportunity for the Company. I am personally asFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-01

Page 4 of 15passionate about developing the Reserve brand and opening more Roasteries as I
was about opening our ﬁrst espresso bar more than 30 years ago in Seattle.
Now as I shift my focus to the next wave of retail innovation I am sincerely pleased
that Kevin Johnson, our current President, COO, a seven-year Board member and my
partner in running every facet of Starbucks business day to day over the last two
years will be assuming the duties of Starbucks Chief Executive Oﬃcer in April 2017.
This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue to proﬁtably grow our core
business around the world.
Let me tell you why I personally asked Kevin to take on the CEO role and why the
Board and I believe that he is the ideal CEO for Starbucks at this moment in our
journey. Many of you are familiar with the breadth of global management
experience in a deep consumer and technology experience and expertise that Kevin
brought to Starbucks when he joined our Board in 2009. Since then Kevin has been
a wise and supportive resource for me personally, both during and following our
Company's transformation.
For years he has provided invaluable insights into how we scale the Company
around the world and how to best integrate industry-leading, customer facing
technology into our customer experience and operations. I'll simply note that Kevin
has been immersed with us on management and operational issues and
opportunities well before he oﬃcially took over the COO role two years ago and that
the two ﬁscal years following his engagement have been the best years in the history
of Starbucks Coﬀee Company with the most recent year producing record shattering
ﬁnancial results and operating metrics across the board.
Let me just say personally Kevin deserves a tremendous amount of credit for those
results. Along the way, Kevin and I have formed a trusting partnership and Kevin's
collaborative leadership style has won the loyalty and respect of our people while
driving the team to deliver record ﬁnancial performance. Kevin brings to the CEO
role an unparalleled understanding of the market dynamics and strategic choices
that have driven Starbucks to become one of the world's most recognized and
respected companies and brands.
We share a passion for customer focused innovation and a commitment to
preserving Starbucks culture and guiding principles. Our complementary
backgrounds, my entrepreneurial journey building Starbucks and Kevin's decades
spent scaling global businesses will continue to help Starbucks navigate this new
period of worldwide growth and innovation.
Kevin is in every respect a true servant leader and a person whose courage,
compassion and empathy model the very characteristics we want for all our partners
and all our leaders. His approach to solving complex problems and his ability to
bring out the best in people will continue to make all of us at Starbucks better in the
same context as he has made me better.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-01

growth opportunities we have in expanding Roasteries and building out our
portfolio of Reserve stores and on Starbucks social impact agenda which will be a
signiﬁcant part of the focus going forward. The truth is in all my years at Starbucks I
have never been more energized or exhilarated about the opportunities that lie
ahead.
Please join me in congratulating Kevin. These are exciting times for all of us and
exciting times for our partnership and the future leadership of Starbucks Coﬀee
Company as Kevin Johnson as our new CEO. Kevin?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Howard, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.
Howard summarized our strategic imperative very well. Given the seismic shifts in
consumer retail behavior we have seamlessly extended our bricks and mortar
experience to the digital world and we are now focused on a multiyear strategy to
elevate the entire brand, extend our diﬀerentiation around the customer experience
and build on the strength of Starbucks as a destination.
Our ﬁve-year strategic plan, which we will review again at next week's Investor
Conference in New York, outlines seven core strategies for growth that will enable us
to capture the global growth opportunities before us. I ﬁrmly believe in this strategy
and we are already in execution mode.
As a leadership team we have prioritized initiatives, allocated resources and aligned
talent to enable us to execute against this strategic plan. It was the key driver of the
organizational alignment decisions we made in July when we created a global
Starbucks retail organization and a Siren retail organization.
Today's announcement is another evolutionary step in our journey. This formalizes
the leadership roles and responsibilities that Howard and I have taken on as we
focus on the strategic plan.
This plan requires us as a leadership team to execute several things in parallel and
do them well. We are doing this by leveraging Howard's unique capability to
establish an ultra-premium consumer experience through the Roasteries and
Reserve stores while we continue to leverage my experience in large global
businesses and technology to accelerate the pace of customer relevant innovation
across the entire brand, all at scale.
I value the partnership that Howard and I have developed over the past decade. My
experience working with him on the Board since 2009 combined with the past two
years on the management team has evolved into a very special relationship. We
share common values, a love for the Company and a commitment to always do theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-01

Q - Sara Senatoreright thing for our partners, our shareholders, the customers and the communities
we serve.
I do want to acknowledge the obvious. Howard is among the world's most iconic
leaders and entrepreneurs. I know Howard doesn't personally think of himself in that
way. But as his business partner and friend I know this to be true. It is a privilege to
work side-by-side with Howard.
I have great conﬁdence in our strategy, the partnership that we have developed and
the world-class talent we have assembled. The women and men of Starbucks
leadership team have become my trusted partners. They support this transition and I
appreciate the passion, creativity and commitment that each person brings to this
team.
We work well together and have built a foundation of trust, transparency and
teamwork. I believe we will elevate our collective contribution as we pursue our
mission and achieve the Company's ambitious goals.
A few ﬁnal thoughts. Having Starbucks in my life has been a gift. I know I am not
alone.
So many Starbucks partners have shared their personal life stories with me and what
Starbucks means to them. I have so much respect and admiration for the more than
300,000 partners who proudly wear the green apron in service with others. And I am
proud to serve them.
I want to thank Howard for his faith in me, his ongoing partnership and the
immeasurable gifts he has given so many for so long. I am honored to serve as the
Chief Executive of a Company that has a role and responsibility and a deep
opportunity to create value for so many.
Thank you. Corey, can we open it up for questions?

Page 7 of 15A - Howard Schultz
Q - Sara Senatore
A - Howard SchultzFrom a historical perspective it wasn't too long ago that Howard stepped away from
the CEO role and then the business struggled. And I guess maybe if you could just
talk in contrast maybe to what went on then versus now in terms of Howard's
strategic role now sort of ensuring that he continues to be engaged maybe in a way
that was diﬀerent from a decade ago or so.
Then I guess the second question is you mentioned the idea of a social impact
agenda. Does that mean we should expect, Howard, to see you take more of a
heightened role in the public sphere or maybe just a comment on that?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
That is a lot of questions you have got there.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
I tried to ﬁt it all in.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
All right. Let's try to go back in history a little bit. And I think that is a very important
question because the diﬀerences between then and now couldn't be greater.
In 2007, 2008 the country was going through a cataclysmic ﬁnancial crisis that
aﬀected all companies, especially consumer brands. And Starbucks was not immune.
The management team at that time, all very good people, just did not have the
capability or the experience to really navigate through that diﬃcult period.
Over the last few years we have built, attracted and retained what I would say is the
strongest leadership team in our history and I would say I would put the team
against any other consumer brand or bricks and mortar retailer in the world today.
The fact that Kevin and I have had a 10-year relationship with him on the Board and
two years inside the Company where he has seen every aspect of the Company's
both tactical, operational, strategic issues, challenges and opportunities and he and I
have had the opportunity over the last two years to speciﬁcally co-author the
strategy that we believe is going to position the Company so well for the future.
I would say on a personal level I don't think I was as prepared then as I am now
primarily because of my conﬁdence in the strategy, my conﬁdence in the team and
my deep, deep respect for Kevin Johnson as a servant leader who will be a
wonderful CEO for Starbucks Coﬀee Company. And I said this earlier and I really
believe this, I think Kevin is better prepared to be the Chief Executive Oﬃcer on a
go-forward basis than I am in terms of his skill base, capabilities, his understanding
of technology and how that is going to be integrated into the customer experience
and put Starbucks once again reaﬃrming our leadership position in all things retail.
I think secondarily I think I have an opportunity with the Roastery and the Starbucks
Reserve brand to really on a global basis create premiumization within an
opportunity for a new source of revenue and proﬁt that would be integrated andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-01

Q - Jason West
A - Kevin Johnsonthreaded back into Starbucks stores that could be beneﬁcial as a standalone
business within Starbucks and beneﬁcial to our core business. So on a net-net basis I
think we are in a much better position just on every level.
With regard to the Social Impact question, I wouldn't overplay what I said in my
prepared remarks because if you look at the last three, four years we have believed
and executed a strategy where we feel that the role and responsibility of a public
company today is very diﬀerent than it was in the years past. We want to use our
scale for good. And if you look at the things that we have been engaged in of late,
Opportunity Youth where we have convened 40 other companies and hired over
100,000 people, 6 million young people in America who were unemployed and not
in work, 16 to 24 mostly African-American, Latino, we have gone after that
successfully and we have had real impact.
The beneﬁt that we have tried to create for the 1 million-plus veterans that are
coming home, that have come home from Iraq and Afghanistan opening up
community stores adjacent to bases, hiring almost 10,000 veterans and/or their
spouse, this is another area of great interest for us. Most recently we have taken on
the eﬀort of homelessness in Seattle and believe that is a crisis across the country.
One out of six people in America are food insecure every night.
These are all issues that we feel as a Company is deeply related to the fact that our
business model for 40-plus years has been to try and achieve the fragile balance
between proﬁt and conscience in social impact. I think that has added to the equity
of our brand, the pride that our people have in working for the Company and I think
we can all agree Republican or Democrat that there's a lot of people in this country
being left behind and we think companies need to do more for the communities
they serve and the people they employ.

Thanks. Just two questions.
One, I guess, can you guys share how long this has kind of been known internally
and how long you guys have been preparing for this change? And should we expect
to see any other leadership changes that result from this, as well? Thanks.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Jason, this is Kevin. Thanks for the question. This has emerged organically as a result
of our strategy and the work we have been doing.
As Howard mentioned, I have been involved on the Board since 2009 and in the last
two years much more intimately on the leadership team. I think as we came out ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-01

Q - Sharon Zackﬁa
A - Howard Schultzour annual strategic planning process in May we sat down, Howard and I both. And
had the conversation around what roles can we each play to have the most impact
on us achieving that strategy. That led to a number of things that we did.
The initiatives we prioritized, the way we align the organization in July. And we sort
of framed the responsibilities that we felt were important to achieve that strategy
and emerging from that was how we set up for me to then take on the CEO role and
Howard to step into an Executive Chairman role. But then the two of us will be
certainly as active as we have been in executing against that strategy. So this has
unfolded over the last several months.

There are no other leadership changes planned, anything signiﬁcant.

{BIO 4804954 <GO>}
Good afternoon. A question for Howard.
Howard, when you handed over the reins the ﬁrst time, I think it was in the middle of
2000 if I am not mistaken, I think at that time you were really, really excited about
international and the prospects for Starbucks and certainly went on to spearhead a
lot of that expansion in your global strategist role. I'm just curious as you think about
premiumization at this point are you as excited about that today as you were about
global in 2000?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
The answer is a deﬁnitive yes. In 2000 I spent those years helping to create the
international partnerships that have endured and really created the ability for us to
actually now have stores in 75 countries around the world.
Interesting enough our partner, Mohammed Alshaya, from the Middle East is here
this week and celebrating our partnership with him where we have almost 900
stores in the Middle East, the Gulf, Turkey and in Russia. But I would say that as I look
at the Starbucks Roastery and the Starbucks brand and what I think is possible, I am
clearly as excited about that in terms of the creativity, the innovation and how that
will have a spill-in eﬀect on the Starbucks core business domestically and around the
world.
Anyone who has had the opportunity to go into the Roastery I think understands that
this is a world-class retail experience that can play in many, many places. And I think
we have now developed a 3,500 to 4,000 square foot model that is a mini version of
the Roastery in terms of its design, materiality, the coﬀee equipment. And with the
addition of the artisanal food from Princi the level of the bells and whistles of aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-01

Company.

{BIO 3948570 <GO>}
Thank you. Howard, I guess last time though also there were some changes going
on, obviously you are entering into food and everything when you were leaving and
there does seem to be a lot of changes going on now.
I guess are you leaving it up then to Kevin or you do play a big role in the business
and in the decision-making and the implementation of things and the positioning of
the brand. Those are some roles that probably need to be ﬁlled, I would think.
Would we expect over the next year either Kevin or Howard to see perhaps a little bit
of strengthening towards the operational and the consumer-oriented management,
the strength of the bench being added to it or is that already done and you have got
that behind the scenes you think already?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
That is completely done. I mean the quality of the management team, the tenure of
the team, the alignment, the trust and coordination of this team under Kevin's
leadership is prepared and ready to assume full responsibility of the things that you
have outlined.
And let me be clear, Kevin Johnson is going to be the CEO of Starbucks Coﬀee
Company and be fully responsible for all aspects of the operations. When or if I am
asked to contribute on the creative side I will be a willing participant. But Kevin and
the team are in charge.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Let me just add to that, I think it is important to punctuate the relationship that
Howard and I have developed over the last two years as we have worked much more
closely together. Our oﬃces are connected, we talk several times a day, we
brainstorm, we discuss ideas.
We are in many ways a team that really, two people in my opinion that value the
diverse perspective or the diverse set of experiences that each one of us brings
together and cherishes what we share in common, the values and the love for what
we are trying to achieve at Starbucks. So I don't see that, I see that relationship as a
huge asset. And certainly I think that relationship is going to continue to ﬂourish and
continue to blossom even with this change.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-01

{BIO 1491816 <GO>}
Thank you. Howard, just a couple of questions along the same lines.
I guess, ﬁrst, you are a man of many talents and I wouldn't try to pigeonhole you in a
one; or two-word description. But I was think of you as a master merchant and
someone who has always been able to ﬁgure out what the Starbucks customer
wanted and needed and ways to stimulate some of those wants and needs even I
would say have been part of your success. Kevin, I appreciate your background in
technology. But is that merchant gene and level of entrepreneurial spirit still within
that senior management team, Howard, do you think?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
This is a team that I have worked very closely with for a number of years and certainly
over the last two years with Kevin. I think the pipeline for innovation both in terms of
food and beverage, the fact that the Roastery is an innovation machine unto itself, if
you look at cold brew and Nitro and the things that are coming out of the Roastery
that will ﬁnd themselves in Starbucks stores.
The opportunity to integrate Princi into the Reserve brand. Then, obviously, what
Kevin and Matt and Jerry have been able to do in terms of the development and the
evolution of the mobile ecosystem we are in the early, early stages of what that
growth and that innovation is going to produce as you see in the better part of
calendar 2017.
I don't think there has ever been a time in the Company's history where the pipeline
of product innovation and customer facing technology innovation has ever been
more robust. In addition to that, the opportunity that we have to thread all of that
into a global enterprise. And this is where I think Kevin is going to add so much
value.
We operate in 75 countries. But when I am really tested are we really taking
advantage of all of the best practices in China, in Japan, in Europe, in Mexico, all of
the places we operate, are we sharing those best practices and are we leveraging it
to the highest possible beneﬁt to the Company, I think Kevin is going to bring a level
of symmetry and agility that will create a signiﬁcant opportunity for us to beneﬁt from
the global enterprise that exists today. And so I have no doubt in my mind that the
merchant mentality, the creativity and the innovation in the Company is going to
remain.
And I'm not leaving the Company. I am here every single day and I am going to
contribute on what I think is a signiﬁcant growth opportunity to build a new franchiseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-01

Our opportunity is how to take that innovation and accelerate our ability to get it to

{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
Thank you for taking the question. Given moving the CEO role to somebody with
more of a background in a broader technology services industry and even the
comment from earlier on the call about a leadership position in all of retail, is there
anything to read into this around setting the stage for opportunities to monetize
some of the intellectual property around mobile payment, loyalty, one-to-one
marketing and making that more sort of central to the growth story at Starbucks?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
First, I would reinforce the importance that the digital ﬂywheel plays in our growth
agenda as a Company. But I would also amplify the way that gets monetized or
translates to shareholder value is by helping us attract and deepen the relationship
with the customer that brings them into our stores and helps enable a great
experience for them in our stores.
It is not about taking the software or those assets that we have built and creating
some new business model to license that intellectual property. It is all about how that
applies to the overall experience that Starbucks creates for our customers, both in
our stores and on the mobile device.

Q - Will SlabaughIt seemed like a pretty ambitious goal to have two times the AUV of a normal store.
Maybe just walk us through the blueprint of when that happens.
And I suspect that we will probably get more detail at the Investor Day next week.
But just curious to hear your thoughts on how you might achieve that benchmark
with the Roastery stores even taking into a factor the innovation that you will have
with those type of locations.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
You are talking not about a Roastery store. I think you are talking about a Reserve
store. Am I right?
{BIO 7448110 <GO>}
Yes, correct.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
We are going to get into this in great detail at the Analyst Conference and we've
prepared, as you have seen from us before, a very detailed understanding of the
value engineering and what we have done to date. I don't want to get into it too
speciﬁcally. Let me say it this way, inside the building of Starbucks in our oﬃces we
have built a life-size mockup of the exact replica of the store that we are going to
open as a reserve store.
The typical size of that store will be probably 3,500 to 4,000 square feet. And we
know from studying what our new Italian food partner, the artisanal baker Princi, has
been able to accomplish in Italy what we are going to be able to do in terms of
revenue in multiple dayparts and multiple need states on food alone. But we have
another product category that we are going to introduce into the Reserve stores that
we will share with you at the analyst conference next week.
This is not new for us. We build 2,000 new stores a year, we have created more
segmentation in one category than probably any other consumer brand that is in the
retail business today. The Roastery has given us an opportunity, we think, to do
something that has not been done before and we are very conﬁdent and we have
the real estate already and we will be sharing all of that with you in a week and you
will see it ﬁrsthand.

Operatorthis really just more of a something that changes in title mostly and it has been
shifting in role for awhile?

I will start, Will. I think I would describe it is says this has been an evolutionary
process that has been shifting over time. I can't point to things that I would articulate
would be big changes. Howard?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
I think the best way to answer that question is I think most people at Starbucks
probably are not that surprised today because this is the organizational formation
that we have had for a number of months and we have been operating this way. I
also want to make it clear that our Board has been intimately involved in these
discussions and in these decisions for months. And the thoughtfulness, the discipline
and the respect for how we have gone about this is we wanted to ensure the fact
that everyone engaged in Starbucks inside and outside of our Company had a full
comprehensive understanding of how we are doing this, why we are doing it and,
obviously, the respect and the admiration we have for Kevin's capabilities and
expertise going forward.
I think with that the best thing we can do is leave it until next week. We are,
obviously, very enthused and excited to present in a comprehensive way our
strategic plan for you and show you and share with you things that you have not
seen before that I think undoubtedly will provide you the comfort that you have
always had in our ability to at a minimum meet your expectations but hopefully
exceed them. Thank you very much.
At this time there are no further questions. Mr. duBrowa, I turn the call back over to
you for closing remarks.
{BIO 3809157 <GO>}
Thank you, operator. That concludes today's conference call.
I would like to thank all of you for your attendance. And as Howard said we hope to
see many of you at our Investor Conference in New York next week. Thank you.
This concludes Starbucks conference call. You may now disconnect.
