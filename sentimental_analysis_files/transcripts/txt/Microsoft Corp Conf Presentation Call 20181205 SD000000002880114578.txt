So that's really good. Hi. that's a really impressive intro. I don't know how to follow
up on this one now.
{BIO 4399320 <GO>}
I only intro with videos (inaudible).
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Hi. thanks for being here, folks. I believe it's like the ﬁrst time you kind of meet with
investors kind of chill like that they're not going to ask all these horrible questions
here on stage. So it's all good.

A - Phil SpencerSure. I started at Microsoft in 1988 as a programming intern. I now run the gaming
organization, reporting to Satya Nadella, our CEO. So I'm member of the SLT,
overseeing gaming across all of devices, content, all the services we build.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. Perfect. Then talk a little bit about -- if I think about Microsoft, there's kind of
Azure and there's Oﬃce and Oﬃce 365. And gaming kind of -- with the Xbox, that's
kind of -- it wasn't kind of at the real center and heart of Microsoft for a while. And
that seems to be changing now. Talk a little bit about the evolution that you see. And
what role did Satya play in this as well?
{BIO 4399320 <GO>}
Yes. It's a good journey. I became the head of Gaming at Microsoft a couple months
after Satya took over as CEO. And we started to have discussions about what gaming
could mean at Microsoft. We started with deﬁning the size of the business, where I
think any kind of startup business should start. When you look at today's world, there
are over 2 billion gamers on the planet. Half of the connected world plays video
games. It's $150 billion a year in revenue. And both of those numbers are growing
double digit. And when you look at Microsoft, gaming really ﬁts in to our intelligent
edge, intelligent cloud strategy. Almost all games that are built today rely on an
intelligent cloud in some way to deliver the services to their customers across all
devices. And games are probably the #1 form of entertainment on any edge device
that a customer owns, whether it's a phone, whether it's a PC, obviously, whether it's
a game console. So when you look at a large TAM that gaming is and a growing
TAM, Microsoft, having brands and services and fans in the category. And the
strategy of where the secular trends that we see in the category aligning very well
with Microsoft's strategy, it made sense for us to start to invest more heavily and in a
more strategic way.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Okay. And just to get us kind of all on the stage, some of them in the audience look a
little bit older. Like can you talk a little bit about the evolution?
{BIO 4399320 <GO>}
I think they look like a young vibrant crowd.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes, yes. It must be my (inaudible). Can you talk a little bit about the evolution? So
like we started -- we had the consoles. We had the PC games. So how has the
industry evolved over the last few years?
{BIO 4399320 <GO>}
Yes. There's really been transformation in 3 important areas in gaming. If you think
about content transformation, technology transformation and business model
transformation. And they're all happening simultaneously. I think a really good
example is a game -- a huge game right now called Fortnite. I imagine most peopleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-05

Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Phil Spencerhave heard of Fortnite. Fortnite was a game that was born on the PC. Many years
ago, Epic Games -- I was actually in Raleigh, North Carolina yesterday meeting with
them, we had been working with them for many years. They started this game
development on PC. They decided they were going to ship this game on console
and PC with a cloud-connected back end. When the game came out literally a year
ago and just started just taking over, they all supported the game to the phone. So
what you have today is a game that natively runs on phone devices, on PC, on
console. All your players play together, which requires technology to connect those
players regardless of what device they come on -- they come from. The economy of
the game spans all the devices. So if I get in and I buy their in-game currency on an
iPhone, I'm able to consume that currency on an Xbox or on a PC. The game, much
like every other form of media, natively lives in the cloud. And the on-ramp to that
experience is the consumer's choice. And we see this happening more and more
across many games. A game that we own is a game called Minecraft. We acquired
Minecraft a few years ago, one of the biggest games on the planet as well. And we
have Minecraft players across all devices and all geos. And we learn a lot from
watching what players want to do.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. And now a ﬁrst alert, a ﬁrst investor question. Like how did the -- how is the
monetization model changing for gaming? Like how do you make money with this?
{BIO 4399320 <GO>}
Yes. The great thing about gaming today is all forms of monetization are actually
growing and are very healthy. Even the traditional retail model of somebody
building a game and selling that game for $60, we just had a huge launch in our
industry, something called Red Dead Redemption 2 from Take-Two. And it was -- I
think if I remember the stats, it's the largest entertainment launch over its weekend,
doing something like $750 million in revenue in its ﬁrst weekend. That is
predominantly a $60 transaction. Somebody buys the game and then they play the
game. And we see growing in retail. In-game monetization or free-to-play games or
low-priced games that actually have an in-game economy, which is what Fortnite is,
also growing tremendously. One thing we added in the last year was a gaming
subscription, where I'm actually able to pay $10 a month and I get access to over 100
games. So for people who -- whether they get their music, their video, they become
very accustomed to getting their media, building their library through a subscription.
And we're seeing very good growth in Game Pass, our game subscription. So we see
subscription growth. We see in-game monetization growth and retail continues to be
a great way to sell games both digitally as well as packaged products.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. Like for us, remember like when Xbox came out like years and years ago, it was
like, oh, there's Xbox and the hardware sale. And they're losing money. And that
world has changed. We basically...

Page 4 of 11Q - Raimo Lenschow

Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Phil SpencerYes. We had our highest revenue year last year with over $10 billion in revenue in the
gaming category. We're seeing software and service grow double digits. And the
business is performing very well. It is an activity that the youth on the planet love. It is
what they're engaging in. The other secular trend that we see. And people have
probably seen this with services like Twitch and Mixer, is not only do people play. But
they actually watch other people play and it's become the socialization of gamers to
watch other people play. And I get asked, hey, what is this watching video games?
And I'm old enough to remember the advent of SportsCenter on ESPN, a channel
where people didn't actually have live sports. It was a channel I was going to go to,
to watch sports highlights. And I remember, there was some skepticism of whether a
channel like that's going to work. It seems like it's worked out okay. And you see in
the video game space that people watching streamers play as they talk about their
experiences is growing tremendously as well. And I think there's real monetization
capability there that we haven't even tapped yet.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. So $10 billion. That's 10% of Microsoft. So that's not a small number.
{BIO 4399320 <GO>}
Yes. Amy -- Amy Hood, our CFO, she likes to tell me I've made the spreadsheet now
and she says that can be a good thing. And I'm on the spreadsheet. So she's going
to pay attention. But the support we've had from the company has been incredible.
We've acquired and started 7 new ﬁrst-party studios in the last year. We obviously
don't do that without tremendous support from Satya and Amy. We understand
content is a critical component of what we're going to try to go build. And the
support from the company has been tremendous.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Let me kind of stop you for 1 second. Like in terms of the -- how games are played.
And I think I get it. But tell me -- so like when I started in college, it was mostly PC.
Then the consoles came out. Now we have mobile. How is that kind of line kind of
blurring at the moment? Like is that all coming together eventually? Or like how is
that going to play out...
{BIO 4399320 <GO>}
Yes. It's a great question. The business grew up as what I would call a per-device
business. I build a game for a speciﬁc device. That device has a certain gaming
demographic and it was very much a per-device model. Today our whole model has
shifted to per user because gamers play games on any device. If they're sitting out in
the audience and somebody boring is on stage, they might be playing a game on
their phone. If they're sitting in class and they've got their PC open, maybe they're
playing a game on their PC. They go home. There's a big television on the wall. They
want to sit down. And they want their experience to span all of those screens
seamlessly. So our transition over the last few years has been very much from a per
device, of I'm a PC gamer, I'm a console gamer, I'm a mobile gamer to just I'm some
somebody who likes to play games across any device. The video we showed there of
Project xCloud is us really looking at the body of content that we have on ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-05
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 11Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Phil Spencer
Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Phil Spencerplatforms today and how do we bring that content to any device that somebody is
looking at. We focus ﬁrst on an Android phone because there's over 1 billion Android
phones on the planet and it's a place that the content that we've natively built up
over the past decades on our platform hasn't been able to reach. But we look at
cloud streaming as a way, over years, where we're going to be able to bring content
to customers on any device that they have regardless of the local compute
capability, again building the experience around the customer, giving the customer
choice on where they want to play. And obviously, when you look at that, we'll have
multiple business models that will work with streaming. But the connection of
streaming with the subscription model makes a ton of sense. You see it in music. You
see it in video. So you can look at Project xCloud and you can look at something like
Game Pass. And you can see there's natural synergies between those 2 things.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. And to make that successful, like if you think about it, you have the consoles.
And you're really strong there. But you have PC games and mobile. Like PC, you
started with a little bit. Mobile, kind of a still -- I would think that mobile is a little bit a
work in progress. Like how do you kind of play -- make sure you play or do you not
need to play because it's actually -- as long as you get the experience for any device
it kind of works? How do I have to think about that?
{BIO 4399320 <GO>}
Yes, 3 or four years ago, there's a big focus on -- I'll just use mobile because it's
probably the easiest example, of who are the big mobile studios out there and what
are the great mobile games. And maybe there should be acquisition M&A that we
do in a pure mobile category. I'll use Fortnite again, Fortnite being one of the
biggest games on the planet, or even Minecraft, our own game, another huge
mobile game but also huge on PC, big on console. We ship it on Nintendo. We ship
it on PlayStation. It's on all the platforms. Those games, are they mobile games? Or
are they PC games? Or are they console games? In the end, they're just games. And I
think more and more you're going to see less content that's tailored to only one
device because it subsets the market and the technology that we're building allows
you to bring that content to every screen. So what you're seeing. And you also see
things like free-to-play games working on console, which traditionally, console was
the world of retail, mobile was the world of free to play. And you'd say PC was
somewhere in the middle. Now you see business models are working across all the
devices because, again, you're actually focused on the same customer who've
become accustomed to that business model across all the screens.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
So the whole -- like our idea, if I talk to a hedge fund and they're all accepting this
mobile gaming content and now you're going to buy the next big -- that actually the
world has moved on in a way.
{BIO 4399320 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, it's -- maybe just because I was in North Carolina yesterday. But you can
sit there. You can look at PUBG. You can look at Fortnite. You can look at Minecraft.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-05

Page 6 of 11Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Phil Spencer
Q - Raimo LenschowYou can look at these huge games. And the games do very well on mobile. They're
incredibly strong on mobile. But that's not to the expense of the other devices where
they do well. You look at these games that have tens of millions, if not hundreds of
millions of monthly active players across all these devices. And we know because we
run Xbox Live. We think about content as a critical, critical aspect. Gamers play
games. The community around these games is allowing people to be connected to
their players and their friends and their content across all the devices. This is why we
invest in Xbox Live and Mixer, our video streaming platform. And then cloud. So we
think about it as 3 Cs, content, community and cloud. Cloud is the way we can
deliver community and content to a player on any device. Yes, I'd say I'd hesitate to
look for a game studio that's only capable of building on one device because
gamers play games on all devices. And I think you're just -- you're missing out on an
opportunity if you're not thinking about games that can work everywhere players
show up.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. Okay. Let's change gears a little bit. Like so I've got 3 little daughters. I'm all
concerned about like what they do and how they play. Talk a little bit about the social
and regulatory risk that is kind of going -- coming with the industry. Or is it there? Is it
changing? Is it coming? How do you think about that?
{BIO 4399320 <GO>}
Yes. It's one of the things that our team takes very seriously. We ask ourselves, what
does it mean for Microsoft to be in this category of entertainment, what should we
stand for. And I think the kind of cultural push and input that Satya has had into the
company has been written about many times. And we think about Microsoft playing
a role in the gaming industry as a way for us to be leaders. And I'm proud of the
work that we've done around parental controls, around toxicity online, around
diﬀerent topics that we need to address, I'll say, as a society. But it can show up in
multiple forms of entertainment. We're in the gaming space. I think about how many
kids have their ﬁrst computing experience grabbing mom or dad's iPhone and
playing Minecraft on that device. And I think our responsibility as the shepherd of
those kids coming into a new social platform, a new game-play platform, potentially
seeing other players. So the parental controls work that we do is critical. I also think
there's a positive -- very positive aspect to this. For example, one of the things we've
done with Minecraft is we have a complete focus on Minecraft in education. And
we've had over 60 million kids take coding practice in Minecraft using the
educational work that we've done there because those kids -- I mean, I started in this
space because I played video games as a kid. And I remember my mom telling me,
these video games are going to be the end of you. And it turned out okay so far. But
yes, I think a lot of kids are really -- they learn, they get interested in STEM. They get
interested in technology. They get interested in how these games are built. And I
think it's important that we make sure gaming is safe and inclusive for everybody.
But it's also a great, great way for us to take the interest that youth have and actually
show kids how games are built and the stepping stools onto many diﬀerent career
paths.

Page 7 of 11A - Phil Spencer
Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Phil SpencerYes. Okay, good. So as a parent, I can kind of somewhat chill.
{BIO 4399320 <GO>}
Well I'll say it. If you have kids that play, set up a parent account on Xbox LIVE. You
should do it. You should understand what your kids are playing, just like you should
understand what your kids are watching on YouTube, you should understand who
your kids are messaging on Facebook. It's no diﬀerent than any other form of media.
The parental control system we have, not to get all soap-boxy about it. But it allows
you to set parental timers on when your kids can play, screen time. So you can say
"Hi. when you get home from school, do your homework." The box isn't actually
going to turn on. You can do that. As a parent, you can approve everybody who gets
to play your kids online. So make sure you're diligent. I'm in the gaming space. So I
focus on this. I think as parents, we should be. I have 2 daughters as well. And it's
important that we understand in an online world who our family is interacting with.
And we work more and more to give people the controls for content and community
so that they can curate that experience to their desire.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Okay. Let's shift gear again. Like you started talking about content earlier and how
important it is to have content. Talk a little bit about your situation in terms of like you
own content but then also have the third parties that you get in here. And there was
going to be a follow-up question on Fortnite. But, yes, let's start there.
{BIO 4399320 <GO>}
Okay. Yes. When I think about who I see as our long-term competitors over the next
decade in this gaming category, I think you're going to see the big tech companies
that Microsoft competes with in many diﬀerent areas entering. And you see it.
Amazon has Amazon Game Studios, they have for a while. AWS has a very large
workload in the gaming space. Google has just started working on Project Stream.
And they are -- you can see the work that they're starting to do to enter this category.
Tencent is a huge gaming company. So when I think about one of the -- some of the
strengths that we have as Microsoft, we've been in this space for almost 2 decades
now. We have long relationships with the best content creators on the planet. And
their content runs on our platform today. So we did some work early on to allow
older Xbox games to work on today's Xbox. And our fans loved that feature. And it
made a ton of sense in terms of we sold more games, we drove more engagement
on the platform. That was great. When you look at a service like Project xCloud, then
you start putting the math together and say, okay, now we have thousands of pieces
of content from our partners. They've already built this content and I can basically
stream it to any player anywhere with any device, which opens up a huge new
market for them. The third-party relationships that we've built. And not only the
games that are under development today but the past 2 decades of games that
they've built on our platform, we're unlocking new business opportunity for that
third-party content. We know that our system really only works if third parties are
monetizing well on our platform. Our ﬁrst parties are important here. But the third
party relationships are a critical, critical aspect. And we have strong business
relationships with the EAs, Activision, Take-Two, Capcom. You can go through the
whole list and we've had long, long relationships and they ship hundreds of piecesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-05
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 11Q - Raimo Lenschow

Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Phil Spenceror thousands of pieces of content on our platform. Our ﬁrst-party content capability,
as we're building new business models like Game Pass and adopting new services,
are really the creators of the ﬂywheel. We're going to invest ahead of the curve in the
market that we see getting created. And subscription is a perfect example. There are
obviously subscription models and other forms of media that you can use as an
example. But investing in your own content to attract players to your subscription
service and the ﬂywheel that gets created as we see millions of people coming into
the subscription and you invest to continue to get fresh new content there, is
probably the most important thing in growing that service.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
And how do you -- so that's the -- and the Fortnite question is coming out. Like we
were all sitting as a team and we were like, what does Phil think about, like why can
we not do Fortnite. Like if you think about that, like on the one hand, you're
beneﬁting from third-party content. On the other hand, it's like why can we not do
that? How do you think about that kind of success of a game versus not success of
the game and success of your content versus others?
{BIO 4399320 <GO>}
Yes. I think, Fortnite having such huge success on our platform is a perfect example
of a strong platform. So I would start by saying, do we have the biggest games in the
world shipping on our platforms natively? Like did we have to do extra work to make
that happen? And we did not. Epic, who built this game. And we all know this, there's
tens of thousands of games in development as we sit here, building a strategy
around us being able to pick the ones that are going to be the hits is not a strong
strategy. Us being a platform that all of the creators target and ensuring that when
the successes happen, they happen on our platform is a good strategy. And that's --
so the thing I love about Fortnite is that it happened on our platform. It happened on
other platforms as well. But we were able to reap the beneﬁts of Fortnite's success
without us actually investing in Fortnite as a speciﬁc form of content because
Fortnite, in a lot of ways, looked like other games that were on the platform. And
maybe somebody out there has a crystal ball on what makes one form -- thing in
entertainment successful over another, that's not our strategy. Our strategy is to have
the best place for all creators to create their content and make sure they have the
monetization tools to go and drive a great business for us. And we will get our fair
share of that through the business relationship that we have. So I see Fortnite as a
massive success for us because it happened without us actually having to go do any
special work to have it happen on our platform. Then, the game monetized so well
and found so many customers on our platform.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Okay. That's great. Then just as part of the monetization, let's talk a little bit about
Game Pass. So that's kind of -- subscription is kind of the way forward. How do -- and
I get that part. How do you diﬀerentiate that against like what a Sony does or an EA
does? Like how does that all ﬁt together?

Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 11Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Phil Spencer
Q - Raimo LenschowSo for us, it's all about how we reach 2 billion gamers. If you build the market around
a couple hundred million people that are going to own a game console or a high-
end gaming PC, then your business model diversity can actually narrow because
your customers are narrow. But when you think about reaching a customer with this
content, where their only compute device could be an Android phone, you think
about, well, what are all the ways that, that person pays for content, if they do at all,
today. So we need to make sure we're world-class at free-to-play content but we also
look at subscription as a much lower-barrier way for a customer to build their library
of content. So we built Game Pass and it started on console. It will come to PC and
eventually it will come to every device. We use the ﬂywheel that we have with
customers on an Xbox to start the growth in Game Pass. But if somebody is sitting
back and taking a longer-term view of where our business is going, you should look
at that as a business model that we think scales to billions of people, not hundreds of
millions of people like retail does. So for us, growing Game Pass early, we're seeing
the success in Game Pass today. It has been critically important, where the content
investment, ﬁrst-party studio investments we're making now are all about
accelerating the ﬂywheel of customers coming in. And we're seeing that work.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes, yes. And (Mike) is going to kill me if I ask you that. Like. So if you think about like,
in that respect, listening to you on Game Pass but also listening to you on content.
So on the investor side. And I have an alert now, like this is all -- you have to buy EA
because there's so much content. And that one you kind of own the industry. But it
doesn't sound like that's necessary.
{BIO 4399320 <GO>}
Yes. You've seen the studio -- well, I don't know if you've seen it. If you watched the
studio acquisitions we've done, we're focused on teams. We're focused on creative
teams that we think can build very interesting content to help the ﬂywheel Game
Pass grow and our platforms grow. We're probably less interested in management
teams and infrastructure and things that we already have inside of our organization.
And you can just look at the track record. We've added 7 studios in six months. And
if you look at them, I think you'll see certain, both, valuations but, more importantly,
the creative teams that we're picking up, knowing that we can then plug them into a
Microsoft infrastructure, an Xbox infrastructure to help those teams succeed with
more solid funding, alignment towards goals around Game Pass reaching gamers
everywhere. And we don't have to pay for some of the things that some of the
bigger publishers have that we probably already have under our roof. So yes, our
focus hasn't been on going out and kind of adding duplicative function that we'd be
paying for that I don't think we need. But more how do we ﬁnd the creative
independent teams out there. And I feel really good about the path that we're on
right now.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Okay. Last question from me. As I think about -- you started to talk about streaming
next year in the cloud. Talk a little bit of what you do there. Then also how much extra
commission do you get? Because you must be driving Azure traﬃc like crazy. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-12-05

Page 10 of 11A - Phil Spencer

A - Phil Spencerthe Azure team must love you because there's so much that needs to be coming
their way if you are successful here.
{BIO 4399320 <GO>}
Yes. If you go and you watch that video again, one of the things to take notice of is
the silicon we're using to stream these games is actually the silicon from our console.
And it turns out that consoles have very compatible kind of design criteria to what a
blade in a server looks like. We want a high power to energy use, low-priced, cooling
is an issue, all the things that these devices care about in the home work really well
on a server blade. The thing that's interesting for us as we roll forward is we're
actually designing our next-gen silicon in such a way that it works great for playing
games in the cloud and also works very well for machine learning and other non-
entertainment workload. So as a company like Microsoft, we can dual-purpose the
silicon that we're putting in. We have a consumer use for that silicon. And we'll have
enterprise use for those blades as well. It's all in our space around driving down cost
to serve. And your cost to serve is made up by 2 things, how much was the hardware
and how much time is that hardware monetized. So we can monetize that hardware
over more cycles of the day -- in the 24 hours through game streaming and other
things that need CPU and GPU in the cloud. We will drive down the cost to serve in
our service. So the design, as we move forward, is done hand-in-hand with the Azure
silicon team. And I think that creates a real competitive advantage. And if you looked
on the map of where Azure lives today on the planet, it lives really close to a lot of
people who don't play our traditional games today. This is about global scale to the
infrastructure that Azure has built and making sure that our silicon and the work that
we're putting into those data centers is used for multiple uses inside of Microsoft.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
And that's more -- now this is the last question. On the personal -- but how do you
solve it? When you're going to listen to this, it sounds really cool. But it's always the
issue of network latency to kind of make the gaming experience a little bit cranky.
How do you solve that? Are we at that point already that we can -- that we're able to

Yes. I mean we're using -- I've been on the road for 10 days now. I've been playing a
ton of games on my Android phones streamed. I go to diﬀerent parts of the planet.
Right now our servers are in our data center in Washington as we're testing, which is
still about 5 hours from our Redmond campus. The thing about Azure is the global
scale of where Azure is. Scott Guthrie, Jason Zander, the team that's been building
out Azure has really built a global strength in Azure in terms of where our data center
and our edge nodes are. And we're putting them close to places where people will
want to go play and speciﬁcally players we don't reach today. Now I love the fact that
I see Azure instances on the continent of Africa. There's 1.2 billion people on the
continent of Africa. And the average age is, what, about 20, 21. Now that's not a huge
gaming market for us today. But if you think over the next decade, the demographic

that we put in place. But the global scale of Azure is a huge beneﬁt to us in this
space.
