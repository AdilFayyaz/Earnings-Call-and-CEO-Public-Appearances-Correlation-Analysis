Time goes by very quickly when you're having fun. Today is oﬃcially my 25th year on
the sales side. So great to have you join us and kickoﬀ this conference. Welcome
everybody ﬁrst of all. This is really the pinnacle of the year as far as I'm concerned
personally to have the corporates with our investor clients come together on the
stage in this forum and get the best insights possible is the best thing we could ask
for as an analyst. So thank you everybody for your support in the last 25 years. Thank
you for my team. Today is a really special day. With that quick round of excitement
from my side out of the way, let's get to our guests here. Microsoft, really delighted
to be able to host a very special guest here, Alysa Taylor, who is Corporate Vice
President of the Business Applications and Global Industry product line. So, what
we're going to do is to have Alysa talk about your job, your responsibility scope and
then dive into some good questions that we have. And every bit along the way, I'm
just going to watch to see if you have a question or two and then look in your
direction, if you don't have a question, we will cycle through the questions that we
have for you.
Thank you Microsoft for -- thank you, Jonathan, for arranging this, really appreciate it.
So Alysa talk about your responsibilities and what does this job title all about?
I can do that. Well, ﬁrst of all congratulations on 25 years, that's very impressive.

Alysa TaylorIt's a big day. So as you indicated, I'm the Corporate Vice President of the Business
Applications Division at Microsoft. And what that entails is that we have functional
responsibility at Microsoft. So I'm responsible for eﬀectively our go-to-market for the
product line that encompasses business applications. So I have a peer on the
engineering side, James Phillips. He builds the products, I get to bring them to
market. We have a global sales leader, Hayden Staﬀord, and then we have our CFO,
who's with us today, Jeﬀ York. So those are the functional leaderships that make up
the business applications division at Microsoft.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Got it. And [ph]give a sense a little bit about these applications, the breadth and
scope of the apps that you're responsible for?
Absolutely. So about 2.5 years ago, we released and -- announced and released
Dynamics 365. So that is our ﬂagship product line within the portfolio. And then we
have the Power Platform, which is -- encompasses Power BI, PowerApps as well as
Microsoft Flow. So that's our extensibility and adaptability. So those are the two
ﬂagship product lines within business applications.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Got it. So I just want to start oﬀ and get out a couple of things that have been very
topical on our clients' minds. One, I'm just curious to get Microsoft's perspective on
the trade wars that have been very rapid in terms of our attention. What is -- how
does this even pertain to Microsoft? And secondly, I also wanted to get the
regulation thing out of the way. Yesterday, the market was hurt as a result of
regulatory fears back at the Internet sector. There is also a sense that -- what does it
mean for software? So just your broad thoughts, if they are relevant and if they're not
--
Yeah, I'm happy to sort of top -- do a top of mind on that. So on the regulation side,
if you think about one of our Microsoft's core pillars is trust. And so when we think
about our customers, data and data privacy and sovereignty, that's something that
we take very seriously. We have a number of sovereign clouds across the world. And
if you -- if anyone has seen Brad Smith, who is our President and Chief Legal
Counsel, you know he's talking very openly about our commitment to data privacy.
So I think that's something that Microsoft stands very ﬁrm on, in terms of that value of
trust. And then on sort of trade wars, you know, particularly I think China is a top of
mind on that. We have -- a small part of our business is China, we do have our multi-
cloud oﬀering in China. We actually just launched Dynamics 365 in China in April.
But that is really servicing the needs of our multinational companies. And so making
sure that we have a global oﬀering.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-04

How is that doing, the China business?
Well, we just launched, so we'll -- time will tell. But, again, it's really like when we
think about our big Starbucks (inaudible) others, it's making sure that we have a
global presence for them.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Got it. Wonderful. Thank you so much. So let's talk about Dynamics for a second.
Dynamics 365 has been growing very strongly. Help us understand what has
changed versus the past two to three years?
Yeah. It's been a very exciting evolution, I would say. So we had -- if you kind of wind
back in time, we had a set of assets that were a collection of ERP assets that were
predominantly on prem. And then we had CRM business that we built at Microsoft.
And there were actually two very disparate divisions within Microsoft. And so we are
competing -- eﬀectively competing ERP systems and then a CRM system. And so as
we look forward to what does the world look like in 10 years, particularly as
customers are going through the adoption of a digital platform, they are having
these big monolithic siloed applications, wasn't the direction that we needed to take
for our customers. And so we actually took on the eﬀort of bringing those assets
together, converging [ph]them among the Azure platform, so we went from our on-
prem and our hosted on-prem environment, rebuilt them onto Azure and then we
broke them down into purpose-built applications.
So they're now aligned by marketing, sales service, ﬁnance, operations and talent.
And we did that with this vision of how do we allow customers to easily adopt as
they're going through their digital transformation. That was the goal in the North
Star. And then we built underneath those applications a uniﬁed data set, it's just
something that we called the common data server. So we could not only share data
freely, across those applications, but we could also ingest data from things like --
from other assets LinkedIn or Oﬃce, communication collaboration, history as well as
our partner ecosystem.
And so the core to our strategy has been how do we enable rapid faster digital
transformation, and we unlock the data that has been historically very trapped in
siloed applications. And so that was the vision for Dynamics 365. And then knowing
that once you have all that data you have to have an adaptability and extensibility
model and that was the introduction of the Power Platform. So we're relatively old in
the Microsoft world, but new in the sort of new vision. So Dynamics 365 was two
years in November.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-04

Okay. Fine. Congratulations. So when you look at the competition in terms of future
functionality et cetera, where are you with respect to the gap or maybe you've
caught up, what's your assessment of the state of the word?
We -- I think as we've gone through this journey, one of the things that as I talked
about was important for us is to be able to be leverage kind of the entire Microsoft
asset class, so being built on Azure, being able to deeply integrate and build with
Oﬃce. And so when we think about our diﬀerentiation and where we think we have
made strides, it is in that enabling of that data layer. So being able to ingest data
across the applications at the data platform level, being able to extend it, customize
it, be able to ingest data from all diﬀerent sources, so you're not just in a CRM set of
data.
And then also having this co-build mentality, so we have our engineering teams
across Microsoft 365 and Dynamics and Azure, co-building features that are deeply
integrated in a ways so you can do things like machine learning within Power BI, you
have out-of-the-box artiﬁcial intelligence within Dynamics 365, you have native
communication with Oﬃce integration.
And so that's very unique to us and we think that's a big diﬀerentiator, when we think
about business applications, because there is -- the market is -- as you guys all know,
is highly fragmented. And so what customers end up with is a collection of assets
and, again, their data is sort of trapped in these diﬀerent silos and then there's a cost
ETL, big data out to be able to analyze it, to create new experiences.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
This is a part of Microsoft business we've not heard a lot from in the past, so I'm glad
that we're having a chance to listen to your update. This is fascinating. You
mentioned digital transformation. I'm just curious if you take a step back, how do
you deﬁne digital transformation? And what are your customers telling you about
what they mean when they talk about digital transformation?
It's interesting. I actually was just down in Atlanta last week and I did a keynote at
Hitachi's customer event. And we talked about the Microsoft view on digital
transformation and when you -- we've had the pleasure of working with so many
companies over the past couple of years, over the past decades, as they've gone
into this digital transformation, which is a big buzzword as we all know in the
industry. But when you look at it, there's really sort of four facets to digital
transformation. There is the, you know, sort of what is the purpose and vision that
you have as a company, like you have to have that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-04

Page 5 of 18Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan
Alysa Taylor
Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan
Alysa TaylorWe even talked about Dynamics 365. What's your North Star as you were going
through an evolution. We talk about the sort of unique potential that an organization
has. So what is the sort of thing that they're either disrupting with an industry or
what's the asset that they bring to bear. One of the examples I gave was Walgreens
and the fact that their unique potential is the fact that they have a retail outlet in the
US within ﬁve miles of each other. So they have density and proximity, and culture
like how are you building the culture of an organization. And so there's a lot of
digital transformation that isn't related to tech, right? That is setting the sort of
foundation. And then you get into capabilities and what are the capabilities of your
people, what's the capabilities of your infrastructure and your assets? And so that --
when we look at that component, when we look at the technical capabilities and
what's unique to an organization. We have this theory which is called the digital
feedback loop. And it's something we talk about pretty widely, you'll hear Satya talk
about it. He talked about it at (inaudible), he'll talk about it at our upcoming
conferences. And it's this notion that you can take all components of an organization,
so people, operations, products and you can digitally connect them. So you have
sort of all facets of an organization, at the center is data. You're able to apply
intelligence over that and then digitally connect every aspect. And so think about a
world where you have a unique view of your customers connected to your products,
connected to your back-end operations, with a 360-degree view that your
employees have. And so that's the digital -- in the capabilities realm of digital
transformation, that's what we talk about is the digital feedback loop.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Got it. Excellent. What would be your goal or the division's goal for the next two to
three years? How do you envision the platform playing out in the future?
So you'll see both in our upcoming, we have our summit that's coming up in June
and then going into the fall, we are continuing to release new capabilities in the
portfolio. And so it is both capabilities within adding in new capabilities of the Power
BI like text recognition, cognitive services, being able to do machine learning, and
then actually new modules. So we released a set of new AI capabilities, customer
insights we just released which is our CPD platform, product insights we'll talk about.
So there's all of these diﬀerent AI out-of-the-box capabilities that will augment the
Dynamics 365 portfolio and then we'll continue to build in new capabilities both
across the Power Platform and Dynamics.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
That's great. So all of the capabilities that you just mentioned from a customer
perspective, how would they beneﬁt -- just maybe a scenario where somebody could
take advantage of all these features. I mean how would that look like?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-04

Alysa Taylor
Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan
Alysa Taylor
Kasthuri Gopalan RanganYeah. There are so many diﬀerent kind of examples that you could give, but if you go
back to what I was talking about with that digital feedback loop, its being able to
bring the technology to bear to enable that digital feedback loop. So a great
example that we give is H&M, which is a global retailer. And they actually started with
-- they have a very large ERP system that governs their entire ﬁnancials and then they
started a boutique line called [ph]The Found , but they needed a rapid supply chain
management system.
They've had to modernize their operations, because to be able to do to go from
mass scale which is H&M is known for, to be able to be in a more boutique nimble
type scenario, they needed a diﬀerent supply chain management company. And so
they started with Dynamics 365. Then they expanded from there into being able to
have better insight into their customers, so they adopted Dynamics 365 customer
service. Then they wanted their employees in store to be able to have real-time
access to their inventory, so they took all of that data and built a unique power up to
be able to have their employees have that view of the back-end operations and the
customer purchasing history.
And so you see this evolution of kind of being able to start in one area, grow over
time, and use the technology to start to connect all the diﬀerent components across
an organization. And then the latest thing that they're doing is they actually -- we
have a set of mixed reality applications that we brought into the portfolio and they
are using a HoloLens and the Dynamics 365 mixed reality applications to do a smart
mirror in store. So you can actually have a mirror that will recommend kind of the
next purchase that you might, or how something might look, if you have sweater and
if you wanted it to be a diﬀerent, bigger, longer or shorter. So that's -- actually they're
piloting that in their ﬂagship store and --
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
So, what would I look like if I adopted Shankar's hairstyle and conversely if Shankar
had mine.
You'll have to ask the mirror.

Alysa Taylor
Kasthuri Gopalan RanganExcellent. Can't wait for that stuﬀ. Couple more questions on the Dynamics side and
we want to shift over to the Power Platform. It's truly exciting at least based on what
we've uncovered so far. A sales navigator, any revenue synergies is that something
under your purview or you able to talk about how that LinkedIn product interacts
with Dynamics? Are you seeing any synergies?
Absolutely. So one of -- as I talked about the common data service, right, being able
to ingest data assets like LinkedIn in the professional network, we actually released
about 1.5 years ago a unique oﬀering which is called Microsoft Relationship Sales,
which is the combination of LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 for Sales.
And we've seen very high growth in that, because what we ﬁnd is when people are
modernizing their sales environment, they also want to be able to incorporate social
selling, relationships selling, and so the synergy between that and then we have
unique integration between Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 for Sales.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
I know it is not what I was planning on asking, but you've said -- mentioned Sales
Navigator and the way people sell is changing. There is a notion that sales
automation is a very mature area in the cloud. You got the number one company in
space, not growing that rapidly in that particular side. Do you think that market still
has growth opportunities? The sales roughly -- not just Sales Navigator, but just the
idea of selling sales automation in the cloud. What are your thoughts on that market
if you have any thoughts?
Yeah. I know, tons, I actually or hopefully should have some thoughts on this. So I
think that there is -- the core CRM system, right, which are the entities that deﬁne
contacts, right, like that is a very mature market. What you see right now coming into
sales automation and you see both sales force, Dynamics as well as new emerging
SaaS players is in areas of being able to take all of that data that you -- you may think
about what kind of rich data you have in a CRM system and be able to do things like
predictive forecasting, to be able to understand pipeline trends and analysis, to be
able to coach real time. So being able to bring in cognitive services and so if you
have an inside seller being able to coach base on the call sentiment analysis. Like,
this is all things that are new that are coming in, that are augmenting the core SFA.
And it's a really exciting space, because the machine-learning AI capability, the
ability to bring in chat into the portfolio, you're seeing that is where the expansive
growth is in SFA.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
That's very cool, very cool. The future looks very interesting. I mean, we thought 25
years back or so, sales automation is exciting and 25 years later, it still is exciting.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-04

Alysa TaylorIt's still exciting. I demoed on stage being able to -- as a sales manager, being able
to see across my sales team who has sort of -- their pipeline trends, but then also
who has negative sentiment analysis from the interactions that they have with their
customers either through email or phone, and then being able to real-time coach
and then recommend new opportunities through LinkedIn. So that integration and
the AI capabilities coming in are quite exciting.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Excellent. And then moving on to Power Platform, it looks like it's got all the makings,
when you look at the whole family the PowerApps, Power BI and Flow. I want to talk
about Flow, because not many people know about Flow. We would love to hear your
thoughts on Flow.
You're going to hear lots about Flow soon.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Excellent. We're in the ﬂow here. We're getting in the Flow here. It feels like it's
disruptive, it can open up a large stem on the things that we look for that investors
like a lot of white space as well. Can you just walk us through the thought process
behind why Microsoft created this whole Power Platform?
Absolutely. And so, when we think about, it's in the business applications family, but
Power Platform is a set of technology that spans across all assets of the Microsoft
cloud. And it was designed very much as a citizen or self-service platform. So being
able to analyze, automate and act on your data. And so if you haven't heard, I mean,
we think data is our sort of greatest -- our customer's greatest asset. And so how do
you leverage that data? And so PowerApps is the ability in a visual drag and drop
environment to create -- rapidly create modern applications.
And we've just seen incredible groundswell of citizen developers gravitating to that.
And for those of you that have been in the industry for a while, or been in the
developer space for years, you've seen these sort of citizen developer platforms
come and go, but you always hit a wall with them. And the unique thing about
PowerApps is the, what we call, no cliﬀs extensibility into Azure. So you can actually
bring in Azure services, Azure app services, machine learning into PowerApps. So
you have the integration directly into Azure. So the app can grow up or actually
leverage more mature features beyond the citizen developer platform. And so it's
one where we've just seen explosive adoption at the individuals --FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-04

I'm sorry. What is a citizen developer platform?
Citizen developer is deﬁned as somebody that is not a professional developer. So an
analyst, somebody that is doing unique business process function.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Even I can do it, correct?
Yes, you can. But we actually -- there's a great story of a security guard in Heathrow
Airport. He's been on stage with us. It's a phenomenal story. He basically was a
security guard and looked around and saw all the paper-based process, taught
himself PowerApps through the community online, launched the ﬁrst Heathrow
PowerApp, they now have more than a dozen PowerApps. He's been promoted from
the security guard to a Corporate IT, and he's helping them modernize their app
environment. It's a phenomenal story. And so we have hundreds of those stories of
people that -- I built a PowerApp for our dinner club, like anyone can do it.

Alysa TaylorThat's to your question. That's a citizen developer, it's not somebody that codes as a
predominant part of their day to day job.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Yeah. Are there certain use cases that are germane to PowerApps that have not been
already automated and handled quite well by the industry business -- development
platforms, something for decades, so is that a speciﬁc niche that you start oﬀ with
that you -- Excel app with PowerApps?
So I think the visual drag and drop it's done in what's called an expression language,
so you can do it like you're writing PowerPoint or a script in Excel, so it's very easy to
learn, like I said there's the visual drag and drop elements to it. The interesting thing
about PowerApps unlike previous development environments with low code, no
code, which is another way of saying citizen development, is that IT couldn't govern
them. And so PowerApps is Azure AD authenticated.
So Corporate IT can actually see all of the PowerApps. So when you have a security
guard building an app, that's an IT, that's actually, normally the worst nightmare. But
now within because it authenticates at the org level, corporate IT can actually see all
of the apps that have been built. And so you have this mix of very easy to adopt with
the ability to integrate into more advanced features and then the corporate IT
governance on that.
And so that's why you see rapid sort of adoption at the individual level, but then you
see organizations adopting broadly and standardizing.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Is it still too early or do you have any customer examples of how large companies
have built some interesting apps with PowerApps custom apps?
Absolutely, so --

Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan
Alysa TaylorYes, he does, it's a great story. I have a video that will make you teary-eyed. So I have
a -- so we have Chevron. Chevron is a great example of -- it started as -- for their oil
rigs looking at how they're modernizing their app platform. The fascinating thing
about Chevron was they were talking about when you're on an oil rig and you're
switching applications, the UI consistency is incredibly important. And so they
actually have -- just they are now broadly adopting, they're modernizing hundreds of
their apps on PowerApps, standardizing for this reason so that they can not only
have a modern app platform but they have a consistent UI. So that will minimize
security and risk with those that are servicing oil rigs.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. The white space for PowerApps, where do you see the opportunity
exist in a way that others have not exploited? Just as you've already answered that
question, is there anything else you would like to add with respect to --
Well, the app development is such a -- like just if you look at it from a pure TAM
perspective, like it's a very large TAM. There is always a set of applications --
enterprise applications. That's an ongoing investment area for organizations. And so
I think it has a large addressable market and that's the unique concept that we've
talked about of being able to do both end-user adoption and at the corporate
standardization level, we think that PowerApps is a very big growth area for us.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Excellent, excellent. Now switching over to Flow. What is Flow?
So, when we talk about Power Platform and I talked about there's an automate
component of it, so Flow is our modern automation platform. So we have hundreds
of connectors that allow you to connect diﬀerent desperate data sources and then
automate diﬀerent tasks. And so Flow, like RPA is obviously another kind of very hot
term in the industry right now. And so that process automation, Flow allows the same
thing we talked about PowerApps which is a very easy way to do automation across
business functions, same type of concept, very easy to do if then statements, rapid
adoption of ﬂow as well. Particularly with our Oﬃce users we've seen high Flow
adoption within the Oﬃce users.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}

Q - Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan
Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantYes, it's embedded in PowerApps, yes. So you can do it, you can -- within any
business entity, like you can automate and that's why the hundreds of connectors are
so important, because you can connect diﬀerent data. And then you can do it in the
consumer space as well.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Of late this whole area of workﬂow more broadly speaking in the Flow, the way you
describe it has gotten quite a bit of attention. There's another company ServiceNow
that has been talked about workﬂow automation has a big opportunity. Why now
and what are Microsoft's strengths approaching this workﬂow market? So only two
companies have spoken about it. Why is there so much excitement here?
Well, I think that when from an -- if I look at it from an why it matters to an
organization, because there are so many tasks, particularly when you get into
industries like manufacturing, there's so much opportunity like job task analysis, to
be able to automate those, they're very manual today and they're costly and they're
higher, they're error prone. And so being able to automate those is something that
companies are now looking at being -- what is a way to do that? I would say
ServiceNow and Microsoft are the big players that are talking about it. But there's a
bunch of emerging companies, (inaudible) in the RPA space. Automation anywhere,
there's just quite a few that are emerging in this space to be able to take those tasks
that are repeatable and automate them. And when we think about Flow in particular
and why, I say, you'll hear us talk a lot more about that, there's some unique things
that I think we bring to bear for Flow, which is one we have the predetermined
connectors. So you can connect across any data source both on-prem as well as in
the cloud.
And then you have the ability with that Oﬃce integration. So if you think about it
from a task perspective, you have your front-line worker that typically has some type
of Oﬃce application that they're using. And so being able to automate both on the
back-end and on the front-end is something that's very unique that we bring to bear
in the automation space or workﬂow space.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
So far I think a lot of us were under the impression that it's just more of a statement
not a question that ServiceNow is the only one talking about it, now you've got
Microsoft talking about workﬂow automation, so it's going to be truly exciting. So
just want to make a quick pause to check to see before we get into BI, if there's any
questions for our presenter? You have a question, Shankar, yeah go ahead.

A - Alysa TaylorAbsolutely, it's a great question. So while Flow is, obviously, is a great asset within
Dynamics to be able to automate diﬀerent workﬂow tasks, Flow, as I was saying, the
adoption within Flow has actually been our highest within our Oﬃce space. But you
can use Flow across any data set of assets. And so the go-to-market is a standalone
oﬀering. We are actually -- the reason we're sort of coming out more broadly now
with Flow is we have -- we're changing the business model around Flow, so that it is
widely adaptable and broadly available to corporations as a standalone oﬀer.

Brilliant. Moving to Power BI. Looks like we hear a lot about Power BI these days.
What is the -- why is this product so unique?
Well, it's in that same family. When we talk about the Power Platform, the theme of
Power Platform is self serve, right? And a very ability to do self-service in this case,
analytics. So Power BI is very -- is very akin to PowerApps in terms of the adoption
patterns. So you see analysts using Power BI, graduating beyond Excel functions to
be able to do analytics in a way that is a very low code, no code type environment,
so self-service BI. And then because Power BI is eﬀectively built on an Azure Data
Lake you can ingest all kind of -- all diﬀerent types of data to be able to do that self --
that BI self analyzation and at the corporate level as well. So that's you see this,
there's a common theme between PowerApps and Power BI, which is enabling self-
service at the individual level and then what is the sort of corporate function as well.
And so BI, in general, has really matured as a category and so Power BI again we've
brought in -- we actually just released being able to bring in cognitive services, text
recognition, new AI capabilities, and then having this direct import export into Azure
Data Lake. So some really enterprise-grade features that have come into our self-
serve BI function.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
So it doesn't feel like it's just a replacement cycle or is it a replacement cycle over the
traditional BI landscape or is it something more than a replacement cycle?
Well that's -- I think you see both right -- again it comes down to when you are doing
-- if you are using BI to analyze a particular function or department, but then you see
as adoption grows throughout an organization, then you actually see the
replacement cycle come in of legacy BI.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
You're seeing that replacement happen right now of all the old 15-year-old
technologies from year-old technology?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-04

Q - Kasthuri Gopalan RanganYes, yes we do see that. And it was interesting, another customer story. I was with the
CEO of Air New Zealand, and he actually said like, if I had gone through the process
of putting out an RFP for modernizing our legacy BI systems, he was like, we would
have been in a multi-year going through all this evaluation and he was like I was just
told by the analysts on my team that we were going to power BI, because it was so
pervasive within his leadership team and within his analyst community. And so you
see this groundswell that's inﬂuencing the modernization cycle and the upgrade of
the legacy cycles.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Excellent, excellent. When you look at this whole BI space, what are the analytics
technologies that exactly the most as far as future potential fundamental analytics
technology? Anything that you could point to?
Well, I think I touched on it a little bit, but it's kind of -- like if you think about
cognitive services within analytics that's a very exciting space.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Yes, tell us more. what is cognitive services?
So if you think about facial recognition or speech recognition, so being able to --
within Power BI, analyze like we've talked about, the cognitive -- the need for inside
sales being able to analyze and understand call patterns of your tell -- if you're inside
tell -- your (inaudible) vendors, like being able to do that to bring in sort of speech
recognition and then be able to analyze patterns on it. The other thing that I think is
that we've seen -- particularly within Power BI that is unique in this area is being able
to actually do trends within within Power BI. So I get an alert every day that says
certain dashboards have had new data or new functions analyzed and I get a report
that actually tells me across all my dashboards what has changed. So you actually
see analytics within analytics, which gets exciting.
And then the other thing that you'll hear more about from us is deeper -- being able
to do deeper more embedded analytics. So not having to go into a BI application,
but how you can actually take advantage of the rich analytics capability and things
like PowerPoint, Excel, so continuing to build that out in the applications that people
use everyday, having that self-served BI embedded. That's a very exciting space in
the analytics. And Google just talked about it, they just came out with talking about
their integration with Google Sheets. You see this move to going to where people
are every single day to be able to do analytics versus pulling them out of the day-to-
day applications.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}

the analytics companies to run on the Azure cloud. So how do you see this theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-04

powerhouse yourself?
Well, I think that's a world where -- the business application space, I think by
deﬁnition is cooperation or competition.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
You have SAP running on--
We have SAP, we have Adobe. And so the thing that if anyone in the audience has
heard, we announced something called the Open Data Initiative last fall. And the
thing that I like about that it's across Adobe, Microsoft and SAP. And the reason that
we came together even though we -- there is competition at the app layer between
all three companies, we're committed to being able to have this Open Data
standards, so that you can actually have data and a common data layer, shared freely
across the applications. So think about it as bringing together data, enriching it and
then ﬂowing it back up through the app layer. And so when you center on this notion
that applications should free data and not house them, then a lot of the -- that's
where we come from when we have partnerships across the ecosystem. It's in pursuit
of freeing customers data, so that they can get more from their data.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Historically, you've seen BI landscape evolve and then the applications companies,
they are somewhat late to the game, but they end up getting there, you saw this --
Cognos, Hyperion, Business Objects, probably half a dozen analytics, pure
standalone companies and ultimately ERP companies started to build, they were not
as good as a specialist, but then they ended up being good enough, and they
ended up acquiring the pure-play BI companies.
Do you -- how do you see this playing out in this cycle? Is there something diﬀerent
that makes a standalone analytics technologies more viable in the long run? Or do
you think the systems of record, I guess you are in both -- you have a Dynamics
business and you have a BI business. You brought thoughts on how this space
evolves. Is it going to be the domain of the companies that have all the business
data, ERP system are, to the pure BI companies, end up being more viable that they
can be the best (inaudible) still have a thriving business, without having an ERP or
HCM or a CRM system.
I actually think about it slightly diﬀerently, because I think the -- those and you'll see
this with what Salesforce announced with MuleSoft, you see this actually with some
of the work that SAP is doing as well. The race I think is not at the app layer, it's
actually the races at the data layer. And so the more that you can aggregate data,
whether it be from an ERP system or from a CRM system or name, you know, yourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-04

it, to build out new applications on it.
I think that is actually the future, more so than the pure-play BI versus those that are
good enough. You see the interesting thing in this space right now is it used to be
historically in all deﬁnitions BI, ERP, CRM, pure play, and you see every single one of
them expanding, knowing that it can't just be about having one function. It's about
how do you cross pollinate and be able to maximize that data and use it in new ways
and reason over that data and garner intelligence. Because in the world that exists
today of doing ETL, it's expensive, it's time-consuming, there's latency, and so there's
this natural gravitational pull to be like how do I take all of this business data I have.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
ETL never sounded good from the get go.
Yeah, so, (multiple speakers) yeah exactly, but I can do it, that's why no one ever

So expensive. So I think, that is, -- I think that is the race right now more so than the

A - Alysa TaylorSo Akash talked about this. ServiceNow is probably the largest in the workﬂow
automation space. In the RPA space, you ﬁnd UiPath. Automation Anywhere as well
as like the emerging players that are very industry speciﬁc like [ph]Drishti . So but
that's really more on the sort of process automation with things like perception
analytics being able to do image recognition. So I think ServiceNow is probably --
and actually Pegasus too. They've sort of redeﬁned into kind of the RPA category into
the digital DPM category. So Pegasus and ServiceNow are probably the two biggest.
Flow for us, as I talked about, is largely a ceded-free product. And so we are evolving
the business models and more to come on that. So when you talk about an RFP,
we're -- we are right now in a high-adoption curve of Flow, but it's not a standalone
business that we're monetizing yet.

Any other questions. David good to see you, the old gang. Old gang has any new
questions. Alright. Good to see you guys. Well, there aren't any questions. I just want
to make a very special mention, the topic of women in executive leadership of
prominence, particularly in the technology industry is something that we pay close
attention to. So it's a real delight to have somebody from Microsoft, very rare
representation in this conference, particularly a woman executive to present. It's
really awesome to see that.
So my hope is that ﬁve, 10 years from now we'll have more women like you
presenting on behalf of their companies and we'll have more of our clientele also
women. So a big shot, my -- it's a topic that's very close to me, because my wife is an
executive in the tech Industry and is a very near and dear focus area. And I also make
it very clear that my team needs to be 50/50 men/women. So we're getting there.
We're not there yet. We have three great awesome women candidates in our team.
So congratulations to you.
