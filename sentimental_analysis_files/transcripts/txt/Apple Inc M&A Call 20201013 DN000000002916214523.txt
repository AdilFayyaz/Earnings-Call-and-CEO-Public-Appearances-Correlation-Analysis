Hello and welcome back to Apple Park. I am so glad you could join us today. Just
last month we were here to introduce some great new products. Apple Watch Series
6, Apple Watch SE, as well as the eighth-generation iPad and the all-new iPad Air.
And we've got some more huge announcements for you today. So let's get started
with an exciting new product for the home we know you're going to love. This year,
our homes have become even more important in our daily lives. So it's critical that
the technology we choose for our home provides a truly great experience. When we
approach designing products for the home, we focus on three key attributes.
First, they must be easy to use, from the initial setup to the way you interact with it
every day. And we design our products to work better together, seamlessly and
intuitively. We also design them to be secure and to protect your privacy. Because
you should be the one in control of how your personal data is used. We applied
these principles when we created HomePod. HomePod is a breakthrough speaker
that combines precise, high-ﬁdelity sound with the intelligence of Siri. It provides an
entirely new way to discover and interact with music at home. And now we want toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-10-13

David Wilkesbring this experience to even more people. So today, I'm excited to introduce the
newest addition to the HomePod family. And I'd like to show it to you now.
(Video Presentation)
This is HomePod mini. And here's Bob to tell you all about it.
{BIO 16442089 <GO>}
I'm so excited to tell you about HomePod mini. It's an incredible smart speaker, with
a compact, elegant design that's perfect for your home. It's wrapped in a beautiful,
seamless mesh fabric that not only looks great, but was created speciﬁcally for its
acoustic performance. On top of HomePod mini is a backlit touch surface that
provides controls for volume, play/pause, and even illuminates when you invoke Siri.
But the design is just the beginning. In creating HomePod mini, we thought carefully
about what you want from a smart speaker. First, you want amazing sound that
ensures your music, podcasts and everything you listen to sounds incredible. Next,
you want a world-class intelligent assistant that helps you wherever you are. And as
our homes become smarter, you want it to serve as the brain of your smart home,
orchestrating and controlling a wide range of devices. And ﬁnally, because it's your
home, you want a smart speaker that puts your privacy and security at the forefront.
All this is exactly what HomePod mini is designed to deliver. And to tell you more
about how we made this happen, let me pass it to Dave and Yael.
{BIO 22161511 <GO>}
At Apple, we have a passion for music, so we knew HomePod mini had to sound
amazing. We started by custom-designing every acoustic element. We created a full-
range dynamic driver that delivers high output while keeping distortion to a
minimum and developed a pair of high-excursion, force-cancelling passive radiators
that enable amazing bass response. We also crafted an acoustic waveguide to
deliver a consistent, 360-degree sound experience, enabling you to place HomePod
mini anywhere. In order to get truly big sound out of this compact design, we
combined it with the powerful Apple S5 chip and advanced software which all
together enables something we call, computational audio.
Even before you hear the ﬁrst note, HomePod mini is analyzing the unique
characteristics of the music and applying complex tuning models to optimize
loudness, adjust the dynamic range, and control the movement of the driver and
passive radiators in real time. And all this happens over 180 times a second. The
result is an audio experience unheard of in a speaker this size and one only Apple
can deliver. Now, bringing amazing sound into your home isn't just about
breakthrough audio quality. It's also about letting you enjoy that sound throughout
your house. Multiple HomePod mini speakers can play perfectly in sync across your
entire house. That's great for entertaining or keeping up with your favorite podcast
as you get stuﬀ done.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-10-13
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 3 of 19Yael GartenAnd when you place two in the same room, they'll intelligently become a stereo pair,
ﬁlling your space with rich, enveloping sound. And to make HomePod mini the
ultimate smart speaker for iPhone owners, later this year, you'll get a new Handoﬀ
experience that's truly magical. Using the U1 Ultra Wideband chip, which we
introduced in iPhone last year, HomePod mini can understand, with high precision,
when your iPhone is nearby. Bring iPhone close to HomePod mini and you'll get
visual, audible and haptic eﬀects. So it feels like your devices are physically
connected as music ﬂows from one to the other. And of course, HomePod mini can
play all of your favorite content. In addition to Apple Music, you can listen to all your
favorite podcasts, along with thousands of radio stations from iHeartRadio,
RADIO.COM and TuneIn. And in the coming months, you'll be able to use services
from providers like Pandora and Amazon. And because HomePod mini has the
power of Siri, anyone in the home can ask to play an artist, album or track, hear a
playlist, or even search for music by lyrics.
(Video Presentation)
Siri on HomePod mini brings you the music you love and helps you discover new
favorites. But of course, Siri does more than just play your favorite music. To tell you
more, here's Yael.
{BIO 21510522 <GO>}
Siri is what makes a smart speaker, well, smart. Siri was the ﬁrst mainstream
intelligent assistant, and today it's the most popular in the world, available on over a
billion devices and handling over 25 billion requests a month. And Siri keeps getting
better. In the past three years, Siri's gotten faster and more concise. Speech
recognition is twice as accurate. And Siri knows over 20 times more facts. Together,
Siri and HomePod mini do everything you'd expect from a smart speaker, from
multiple timers and alarms to weather reports to answering the random questions
kids think up. But what really sets HomePod mini apart is Siri's deep integration with
iPhone. Using Siri, HomePod mini can access the apps on your iPhone to send a
message, check your calendar, make a call, even ﬁnd your iPhone. And because of
this, you'll be able to ask HomePod mini for a personal update with just a single
request.
(Video Presentation)
Of course, your voice isn't the only voice in your house. Siri knows that and can
recognize the voices of each member of your household so that everyone gets their
own personal experience.
(Video Presentation)
And deep integration with iPhone also enables a magical experience with CarPlay.

the home.
Next, let's turn to the smart home. When it comes to your home, you want comfort
and convenience without complexity. So with HomePod mini, we've made the smart
home simple. HomePod mini automatically integrates with the Home app so you can
control all of your HomeKit accessories with just your voice. You can ask to turn down
the heat, lock the doors, dim the lights, or even set a scene.
(Video Presentation)
To control multiple accessories with a single voice command. And if you're just
getting started with your smart home, the new Discover Tab in the Home app makes
it easy to ﬁnd all kinds of great smart home accessories to control lighting, security,
comfort and more. One of the most important parts of the smart home is
communicating with your family, which is why we created, Intercom. Intercom lets
you quickly send a message from one HomePod to another in a diﬀerent room or to
multiple rooms throughout your home.
(Video Presentation)
But what's really exciting is that we've taken it a step further and designed Intercom
to also work with your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and even CarPlay, something only
Apple can do. You'll get a home intercom system that goes everywhere with you.
(Video Presentation)
The message will automatically play on HomePod speakers throughout the home,
and a notiﬁcation will appear on your family's personal devices. And Intercom
messages will play on AirPods as well, so you can always get your kid's attention.
(Video Presentation)
Intercom helps connect the members of your home in an entirely new way. We're so
excited about how HomePod mini brings the power of Siri intelligence to your smart
home. Back to Bob.
{BIO 16442089 <GO>}
Not only is HomePod mini packed with great features, like every Apple product it's
designed with your privacy and security in mind. Nothing you say is sent out of your
home until you activate Siri with a touch or it hears those magic words, "Hey Siri."
And your requests are not associated with your Apple ID, and you choose whether
Apple saves your audio recordings. Personal requests only work when your iPhone is
home with you, and all communication with smart home accessories uses strong
encryption. We can't wait for you to enjoy the incredible experiences the new
HomePod mini brings to your home. It comes in both white and space gray, and I'mFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-10-13

intelligent assistant, great features like Intercom and tight integration with your
favorite Apple devices. And now back to Tim.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
Now let's talk about iPhone. iPhone is an incredibly powerful and personal device.
It's the product we use the most every day. With amazing capabilities, iPhone has
changed our lives and has never been more indispensable than it is now. It's been
another big year for iPhone. Ever since its launch, iPhone 11 has been the most
popular smartphone in the world. People love their iPhones. iPhone has led the
industry in customer satisfaction every year since it was ﬁrst introduced. There's so
much that people love about their iPhones. They love how easy it is to use, how it
connects people in personal ways, how it elevates photography, keeps us informed
and keeps us entertained.
With a powerful ecosystem of apps in the App Store, iPhone enables people to do
more and more things every day. And users can trust that iPhone is designed to do
all of this while protecting their security and privacy. Every decade, there's a new
generation of technology that provides a step change in what we can do with our
iPhones. The next generation is here. Today is the beginning of a new era for iPhone.
Today we're bringing 5G to iPhone. This is a huge moment for all of us, and we're
really excited. 5G will bring a new level of performance for downloads and uploads,
higher quality video streaming, more responsive gaming, real-time interactivity and
so much more. 5G networks are more advanced, with lower latency and less network
congestion. So you can get higher network speeds even in densely populated areas.
And 5G even helps protect your privacy and security, since you won't need to
connect to unknown, unsecured, public Wi-Fi hotspots as often. Each generation of
cellular network technology on iPhone has enabled breakthrough innovations and
entirely new opportunities for our developers and our users. And 5G is the most
exciting step yet. For so many people, this all becomes real with 5G coming to
iPhone. As you know, iPhone provides seamless integration of world-class hardware
and world-class software. What you may not know about is the incredible
collaboration between Apple and our carrier partners around the world to ensure
iPhone users get the best possible experience. We're fortunate today to have one of
our closest partners join us. I'd like to welcome Hans Vestberg, Chairman and CEO
of Verizon, here to Apple Park. Hans, this really is a big day. And our teams have
done some amazing work together.
{BIO 1930652 <GO>}
I want to thank you and the whole Apple team for a fantastic collaboration leading
up to this historic moment. Until now, most people have taken a "wait and see"
approach to 5G. They've been waiting for 5G to get real, with the network coverage
they expect, the incredible performance they have been promised, and the devices
they love. Well, today with iPhone, the wait is over. 5G just got real. Of course, what'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-10-13
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 6 of 19Tim Cookthe most exciting part for me as a guy who has worked in networking for 25-plus
years? That fact that for the ﬁrst time ever, iPhone can now access Verizon's 5G Ultra
Wideband. It's built with large quantities of mmWave spectrum that enable
unprecedented performance.
5G Ultra Wideband has already been recognized as being the fastest 5G in the
world. And it's getting even faster. Our 5G network now gives you double the peak
download speeds, over 4 gigabits per second today in ideal conditions and even
higher over time. And double the upload speeds at over 200 megabits per second.
So whenever you're watching a high-deﬁnition movie or you're planning business
workﬂows with real-time augmented reality, you can be sure that there's no faster 5G
anywhere on earth. 5G Ultra Wideband has, also, a massive capacity. We're building
it to help remove bottlenecks in crowded places where thousands of people use
their phones at the same time. Because one day we'll be safely back in those places.
And so, we're nearly doubling our 5G-enabled stadiums, venues, airports, train
stations, and lighting up some of the busiest locations in the country.
This enables amazing things, like reinventing the in-stadium fan experience with our
NFL partners. The new Verizon 5G SuperStadium experience in the NFL app lets fans
see and feel the action from up to seven camera angles, including views from
players' eyes, and an immersive augmented reality like never before. We're excited
for NFL to be rolling this out to many stadiums through the course of the season.
And ﬁnally, 5G Ultra Wideband provides you with super low latency, so experiences
like multiplayer gaming feel like they're happening in near real time, freed from the
conﬁnes of your home. Together with Apple, Verizon has partnered with one of the
world's leading gaming companies for some exciting news that you'll hear about
later today. To make this incredible experience available to more people, we're
doubling down on our fastest network, the 5G Ultra Wideband, with double the
coverage in existing cities like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and expanding into
new cities like Philadelphia and San Francisco, with 60 cities by year-end.
In addition to our 5G Ultra Wideband network, we have an extensive 5G network.
And today, we're excited to announce that Verizon is turning on our 5G Nationwide
network, reaching more than 200 million people across more than 1,800 cities and
towns. So, all of the pieces have now come together, the coverage of 5G
Nationwide, the unprecedented performance of 5G Ultra Wideband in more and
more cities, the reliability you expect from Verizon. With the ﬁrst 5G iPhone on the
5G America has been waiting for, we can ﬁnally say, 5G just got real.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
Hans, this is deﬁnitely the start of something big. Thank you for joining us, and thank
you for all the great work we're doing together. We are very excited about 5G on
iPhone, and we're going to introduce 5G across our entire lineup of new iPhone
models today. So now I'd like to show you the very ﬁrst iPhone with 5G.

Page 7 of 19Kaiann DranceIntroducing iPhone 12. To tell you all about it, I'd like to hand it over to Kaiann.
Let's take a closer look at iPhone 12 with 5G. It has an all-new design that's simply
stunning. It has smooth, ﬂat edges, allowing the aluminum frame and glass to stay
ﬂush, front and back, creating this unique uniform construction. Inside and out,
iPhone was re-architected to pack in new technologies into a smaller form factor.
iPhone 12 was designed with 5G in mind, including the position of all-new antennas
which go around the aluminum frame. The design looks amazing in ﬁve stunning
new colors: Black, White, Product Red, Green and a gorgeous Blue.
IPhone 12 features the same great 6.1-inch display size as iPhone 11, yet we reduced
the display borders to create a much smaller iPhone. If we compare it to iPhone 11,
iPhone 12 is 11% thinner, 15% smaller in volume and 16% lighter. Keeping the display
size and reducing the footprint was only possible by bringing our best display
technology to iPhone 12. And that is our Super Retina XDR display. Our new Apple-
custom OLED has many advantages over LCD. Each OLED pixel has its own light
which can be individually controlled, giving us pixel-precision brightness, rich colors
and an amazing two-million-to-one contrast ratio for true blacks in photos, videos,
games. And Dark Mode looks fantastic. The new OLED display also has a higher
resolution, with twice as many pixels as iPhone 11. It now has 460 pixels per inch. So
text will be sharper for easier reading, and your photos will look better, with more
detail, increased dynamic range and precise color. And peak brightness is nearly
twice as high for HDR content: 1,200 nits, and we include support for HDR video
formats: Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG.
We obsess over making your display impeccable, and of course it's important that
we protect your display in the best way. The cover glass on iPhone 11 is the toughest
in the industry, but iPhone 12 leaps ahead with something even better. Much better.
Our incredible Materials Engineering team has been working closely with our
partners at Corning, the leaders in glass technology, on a new cutting-edge material.
And we call it Ceramic Shield. Ceramic Shield goes beyond glass by adding a new
high-temperature crystallization step which grows nanoceramic crystals within the
glass matrix to dramatically improve toughness. To make this material both tough
and optically clear, we precisely control the type of crystals and degree of
crystallinity. This was the breakthrough that made Ceramic Shield possible for
iPhone. Ceramic Shield is tougher than any smartphone glass, and along with our
new design it makes iPhone more durable than ever. We measured four times better
drop performance. That means if your iPhone accidentally slips out of your pocket,
Ceramic Shield will have four times the chance of surviving without cracking. This is
the biggest jump in reliability we've ever had on iPhone, and we are thrilled to bring
that to iPhone 12.
Let's talk more about the 5G capability on iPhone 12. As Tim said, to create the best
possible 5G experience it required seamless integration of hardware and software,
and partnering closely with carriers. Here's Arun to tell you more.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-10-13

Hope GilesI'm here in one of our 50 world-class anechoic chambers where we develop and test
advanced wireless capabilities like 5G. And we approach this diﬀerently than anyone
else. Starting with hardware, we designed custom 5G antennas and radio
components that allow us to target exactly what works best in the entire system. We
can be very space eﬃcient while also including the most 5G bands in a single
phone, to work on 5G in more places than any other smartphone. Another Apple
advantage is our ability to engineer a fully integrated system from silicon to software.
We analyzed our entire software stack from applications down to ﬁrmware to take
advantage of 5G speeds. For example, we optimized iOS frameworks, so apps can
get the beneﬁt of 5G without using more power.
5G makes iPhone faster. We also made 5G smarter with Smart Data mode. When
your iPhone doesn't need 5G speeds, it automatically uses LTE to save battery. But
the instant 5G speeds do matter, iPhone starts using it. We also conduct rigorous
validation. For example, this custom-built anechoic chamber helps us replicate
signals from multiple sources and directions. We use this data to optimize our
antenna system and our unique beamforming algorithms. To deliver 5G around the
world, we collaborate closely with carrier partners, ensuring iPhone has great
throughput, coverage, call quality and battery life. We've completed 5G testing on
over 100 carriers in over 30 regions, and we're seeing impressive peak speeds on
iPhone 12. Up to 3.5 gigabits per second in ideal conditions. Of course, 5G speeds
will vary by carrier and region.
In the US, we also support mmWave, the high frequency version of 5G on all iPhone
12 models. This includes support for Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband network. This
technology is ideal for densely populated areas and crowded stadiums. With wider
bandwidth, it can deliver even higher speeds. In fact, we have measured over 4
gigabits per second in ideal conditions and up to 1 gigabit per second in typical
conditions. This is just the beginning, and we're excited to oﬀer iPhone users the
best possible 5G experience. Now back to Kaiann.
Now let's talk about the chip that powers the new iPhone. The A13 Bionic on iPhone
11 is still the fastest chip in a smartphone. That's until now.
We have a new chip developed by our world-class silicon team. A14 Bionic, the
fastest chip ever in a smartphone. Let me quickly take you to our secret chip lab
where Hope will tell you all about it. And ﬁnally, here's Hope.
Every year, iPhone sets the standard for mobile performance, even challenging the
performance of laptops. This year, A14 Bionic also marks a very important milestone
in the history of iPhone. A14 Bionic is the ﬁrst smartphone chip in the world built on
the latest 5-nanometer process technology. The reduction in transistor size enablesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-10-13

Kaiann Dranceus to add features and increase performance, all while improving energy eﬃciency.
Our Silicon Engineering team has packed 11.8 billion transistors into A14 Bionic, an
increase of nearly 40% compared to A13. A14 improves performance and eﬃciency
across the entire design of the chip, starting with the CPU. The new 6-core CPU in
A14 is the fastest CPU in any smartphone. In fact, it's up to 50% faster.
A14 also features our latest 4-core GPU design, driving increased image quality and
overall eﬃciency, so it's even better for advanced games and machine learning. And
compared to the competition, it's the fastest GPU in any smartphone, delivering up
to 50% faster graphics. We've also made signiﬁcant architectural changes that push
the limits of ML processing, a critical design investment to enable new experiences.
We've dramatically increased the performance of our Neural Engine by growing
from 8 to 16 cores. This change delivers up to 80% faster performance on the most
critical machine learning models. This new Neural Engine is capable of an
astounding 11 trillion operations per second. And we've also increased the
performance of our CPU's dedicated ML accelerators, now 70% faster, so our
developers beneﬁt from considerably improved ML performance on our entire chip.
Our silicon powers every experience on the iPhone, and with A14 Bionic we make
those experiences even better with big updates to our CPU, GPU and a dramatic
increase in machine learning capabilities. Back to Kaiann.
A14 Bionic enables console-quality games. With the faster speeds and lower latency
of 5G, multiplayer gaming gets even better. Later this year, one of the best games of
all time is coming to iPhone. It has held the prestigious title of most popular, most
played and most viewed game in the world and revolutionized e-sports with over
100 million people watching the world championship last year. I'm, of course, talking
about League of Legends. Using the power of the new A14 Bionic and Verizon's 5G
Ultra Wideband network, iPhone gaming is taking an enormous leap forward. Here's
Michael Chow, Executive Producer from Riot Games, to tell you more about it.
{BIO 15873963 <GO>}
At Riot, we aspire to make games that meet our players wherever they are. League of
Legends is the world's most popular PC game. But now with the insanely powerful
iPhone 12 and Verizon 5G, we believe it's the perfect time to bring League to iOS.
This is League of Legends: Wild Rift. The power of A14 Bionic literally blew us away. It
allows us to show oﬀ champions like Ashe with a brand-new level of ﬁdelity that you
can't ﬁnd on any other platform. With oﬀ-the-charts GPU performance and frames
per second, you get amazing details and ﬂuid gameplay, even in the most chaotic
team ﬁghts. On iPhone 12, gameplay is always responsive and unbelievably smooth.
Until now, to be competitive in League of Legends, you had to be tied to your desk.
But Verizon 5G frees you to game like a pro pretty much anywhere, no Wi-Fi
required. And with wicked-fast speeds up to 25 times today's networks, not only is
gameplay fast, but so are downloads. So you can instantly grab dope new skins that
show oﬀ all your favorite champs. We'll see you on the Wild Rift.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-10-13

Page 10 of 19Deniz TeomanWow, what a huge moment for mobile gaming. We can't wait to play League of
Legends on iPhone 12. A14 Bionic also combines with our cameras and powerful
software to deliver the new dual-camera system of iPhone 12. It has the Ultra Wide
camera that people love and use to take inspiring photos in creative ways. iPhone 12
also has a new Wide camera with an f/1.6 aperture, our fastest yet. This allows more
light to hit the sensor, making every photo better. Along with the wider aperture, we
developed our ﬁrst 7-element lens to maintain sharp detail in your photo from edge
to edge. This delivers a 27% improvement in low-light performance, so photos and
videos all around will have less noise and brighter results. Like in this photo, with
fantastic detail in her hair, clothing, and the sun's reﬂection.
On top of this, we use computational photography to deliver even more powerful
new features. Our Smart HDR 3 continues to bring out details in faces, like you see
here when the sun is so bright behind her. Now it understands scenes with machine
learning and applies more adjustments to distinct parts of the photo. For example,
Smart HDR 3 brings out more detail in the rocks and uses sky segmentation to adjust
for color, contrast and noise. Computational photography also enables Night mode,
which has been called the best in the industry. Night mode on iPhone 12 gets even
better. The faster aperture captures more light. And now, we are expanding Night
mode to all cameras of iPhone 12, for the ﬁrst time on the Ultra Wide and front
TrueDepth camera, which is perfect for Night mode selﬁes. This is without a ﬂash.
These cameras are incredible.
Let's take a look at other photos shot on iPhone 12. This photo makes use of the Ultra
Wide lens while maintaining sharpness and clarity like you see in the branches and
leaves. Here's another Ultra Wide photo, shot from below. Just look at the amazing
details in the clothing and chandeliers. In this low-light portrait photo, the color and
warm light in the background come together seamlessly. For video, iPhone
continues to lead the industry with the highest-quality video. And with the larger
aperture, iPhone 12 video will get even better, with big improvements in lower light.
We're adding Night mode time-lapse, with longer exposure and brighter frames
when using a tripod. We wanted to show you iPhone 12 in action, so here's a video
we shot and edited entirely on iPhone 12.
(Video Presentation)
With an amazing camera on the go and 5G speeds, iPhone 12 takes us into an even
more wireless world. We love wireless charging, but want to improve the experience.
When setting down your phone, you can miss the exact center of the charger, which
can result in slow, less eﬃcient charging, or none at all. So with iPhone 12, we are
making this so much better. But that's not all.

Introducing MagSafe for iPhone. To tell you more, here's Deniz.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-10-13
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 11 of 19Kaiann Drance
Lisa JacksonMagSafe is an advanced new system. It starts by improving the wireless charging
experience. Our wound wire coil, which is unique in the industry, now
accommodates magnets and maintains compatibility with existing Qi chargers. The
magnets are optimized for alignment and eﬃciency. And we improved our shielding
design to safely provide up to 15 watts for faster charging. We use a custom
nanocrystalline shield to capture magnetic ﬂux. We also added two new sensors: a
single-turn coil NFC and a sensitive magnetometer, which senses magnetic ﬁeld
strength and can instantly react to it. This enables iPhone 12 to recognize and
provide a better experience for accessories.
Any MagSafe accessory can simply snap onto the back of iPhone. So, this is really
great. We're enabling a whole new ecosystem for MagSafe, starting with all-new
cases for iPhone 12: silicone, clear, leather, which have magnets to snap on and oﬀ,
and they're far easier to use. And you can use other MagSafe accessories on top of
the cases, like the MagSafe charger. And there's a MagSafe wallet. It just snaps to the
back of iPhone and also works on top of MagSafe cases. The leather sleeve uses
MagSafe sensors to identify when iPhone is inside to reveal the clock.
We also developed the new MagSafe Duo Charger for your iPhone and Apple
Watch. You can charge both devices with one charger, and it folds up easily for when
you travel. And these are just the accessories we are introducing. Belkin is already
working on a couple of new accessories: a car mount and a multi-charger dock. We
can't wait to see the innovative ways that others will use MagSafe, creating a robust
and ever-expanding ecosystem.
Back to you, Kaiann.
We also have some big environmental news for iPhone. To tell you more, here's Lisa.
{BIO 7568663 <GO>}
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for our global corporate operations. Our oﬃces,
stores and data centers run on 100% renewable energy. And we're proud of how far
we've come. But by 2030, we plan to have net zero climate impact across our entire
business, including our manufacturing supply chain and all product life cycles. This
means that every Apple device sold, from material collection, component
manufacturing, assembly, transport, customer use, charging, all the way through
recycling and material recovery will be 100% carbon neutral.
Many of iPhone 12's environmental features build on our past progress, removing
harmful chemicals and using renewable and recyclable materials. And now, for the
ﬁrst time, we are using 100% recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, including
the camera, haptics and MagSafe. We've also been transitioning our iPhone
manufacturing partners to renewable energy. And just like we did with Apple Watch,
we looked for ways to cut waste and use less material. Customers already have overFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-10-13

experience with AirPods, Beats or other wireless headphones.
And there are also over 2 billion Apple power adapters out in the world, and that's
not counting the billions of third-party adapters. So we are removing these items
from the iPhone box, which reduces carbon emissions and avoids the mining and
use of precious materials. Removing these items also means a smaller, lighter iPhone
box. We can ﬁt up to 70% more products on a shipping pallet, reducing carbon
emissions in our global logistics chain. Taken altogether, the changes we've made
for iPhone 12 cut over two million metric tons of carbon emissions annually. It's like
removing 450,000 cars from the road per year. This is huge, and we're really proud
that Apple is taking the lead. We hope others will follow, making this impact even
bigger for our planet.
Back to you, Kaiann.
Now every iPhone will include the more advanced and higher power USB-C to
Lightning Cable. It can be used with any standard USB-C power adapter or
computer port. And USB-C enables fast charging. So that's iPhone 12 with 5G. But to
add to all these big announcements, we also wanted to do something a little
diﬀerent.
(Music Playing) Something only Apple would do. (Music Playing) This is iPhone 12
Mini. With its amazing size, it ﬁts in the palm of your hand, while still keeping the
expansive edge-to-edge Super Retina XDR display. It's smaller and lighter than our
4.7-inch models like iPhone 8, but with a larger 5.4-inch display that let's you see so
much more. With its compact size, the iPhone 12 Mini has the exact same features as
iPhone 12. You're just choosing between two great sizes. In fact, iPhone 12 Mini is the
smallest, thinnest and lightest 5G phone in the world. With its large screen and
compact size, we think this will be an incredibly popular iPhone.
Everything on iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini is the latest: 5G, the fastest chip with A14
Bionic, most advanced display with OLED, all-new design with Ceramic Shield, even
better water resistance, new cameras for low light, and MagSafe. Let's see everything
iPhone 12 can do.
(Video Presentation)
Even with these huge updates, the iPhone 12 lineup will start at just $699 for iPhone
12 Mini and $799 for iPhone 12. We also have great ﬁnancing options from Apple as
well as our partners. This includes a very special oﬀer from Verizon. If you trade in an
iPhone X or newer, you can get iPhone 12 starting at $15 per month for 24 months, or
iPhone 12 Mini for just $12 per month. This is an unprecedented leap forward for
iPhone. There is simply nothing like iPhone 12.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-10-13

{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
(Music Playing) iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini are absolutely amazing. They are the
start of a new era for iPhone. Yet that's just half of our iPhone story today. We want to
take it even further with our pro line of iPhones. And here they are.
(Video Presentation)
This is iPhone 12 Pro. I'd like to hand it over to Joz to tell you all about it.
{BIO 3260601 <GO>}
(Music Playing) iPhone 12 Pro is designed for our users who want the absolute most
from their iPhone. It takes our new design even further with premium materials. This
includes a durable and beautiful surgical-grade stainless steel band and precision-
milled back glass. They come in four new ﬁnishes, including an elegant silver, a rich,
deep graphite, a stunning gold and an all-new Paciﬁc Blue. They're engineered with
an advanced PVD process that provides a spectacular luster. And our new gold uses
a high-power magnetron coating process that gives the stainless steel a stunning
bright gold ﬁnish. The pro models also feature our incredibly durable Ceramic
Shield. And these models have best-in-class water and dust resistance with an IP68
rating, so they can withstand submersion at up to six meters for 30 minutes.
The pro design is complemented beautifully with our new MagSafe accessories
which provide easy and secure attachment and high-power charging. iPhone 12 Pro
features our industry-leading Super Retina XDR displays. We were able to go from
today's 5.8-inch to a much larger 6.1-inch display. And iPhone 12 Pro Max increases
from today's 6.5-inch to a more expansive 6.7-inch display. We were able to grow
these displays, but keep the form factors nearly identical. So for people who want
our biggest displays, this is the largest display ever in an iPhone, with our highest
resolution, featuring nearly 3.5 million pixels.
HDR video comes to life. High-resolution HDR movies and TV shows that you stream
over 5G will look amazing. Our pro models are packed with pro-level performance.
While our competition is scrambling to catch up with our chips from last year, we
remain generations ahead. And our advantages go beyond the CPU and GPU.
Together with our Image Signal Processor, or ISP, they enable powerful
computational photography for camera experiences that simply are not possible
with traditional cameras. For example, Deep Fusion uses machine learning on the
Neural Engine for pixel-by-pixel processing of photos with unprecedented detail,
texture and minimal noise.
To accomplish this, Deep Fusion uses all the compute engines of the A14. Our
camera sensor captures multiple images and processes them through the ISP. The
CPU computes the alignment of the frames. The GPU pre-processes the images
before running them through the Neural Engine. And then there's additional post-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-10-13

Page 14 of 19Andrew Fernandez
Alok Deshpandeprocessing done in the GPU. With A14 Bionic, we are able to bring Deep Fusion to all
four cameras of iPhone 12 Pro, including the front-facing TrueDepth camera.
We combine state-of-the-art camera hardware with this amazing compute power to
create a pro camera system that is unlike any other device. iPhone 12 Pro features our
amazing Ultra Wide camera with a 120-degree ﬁeld of view, and our new wide
camera with faster f/1.6 aperture and seven-element lens that let's in 27% more light.
iPhone 12 Pro also features a 52-mm telephoto camera for stunning portraits. So
iPhone 12 Pro delivers high-quality optical images at three diﬀerent focal lengths,
with a 4x optical zoom range. The larger size of the iPhone 12 Pro Max provided us
with an opportunity to do even more with our pro camera system.
And here's Andrew to tell you all about it.
(Video Presentation)
In iPhone 12 Pro Max, we've been able to create our best camera ever. We have a
brand-new Telephoto camera with a 65 mm focal length. Moving from a 52 mm focal
length to a 65 mm allows for longer framing in the classic portrait style. With the new
Telephoto, you can now optically zoom in 2.5 times for even closer shots or tighter
crops, which means improving to a 5x optical zoom range from the Ultra Wide's 13
mm to the Telephoto's 65 mm. iPhone 12 Pro Max features an all-new massive wide
camera with an f/1.6 aperture, a new sensor and new system for Optical Image
Stabilization, or OIS.
Let me ﬁrst tell you about the new sensor. It's 47% larger, with 1.7 micron pixels, our
largest yet. Larger pixels plus a faster aperture gives iPhone 12 Pro Max an incredible
87% improvement in low light, which is our biggest leap in light gathering capability.
On top of that, we developed a completely new system for optical image
stabilization that adopts a high-end DSLR approach called sensor-shift. Sensor-shift
applies stabilization to the sensor instead of the heavier lens to precisely control
motion in X and Y, while maintaining sharpness. This cancels both low and high-
frequency disturbances like hand movement or vibrations in a car.
In addition, the OIS on all our wide cameras this year can now make 5,000 micro
adjustments per second, which is ﬁve times more than last year. Along with motion
processing advancements, we get stabilized exposure times of up to two seconds in
low light for handheld shots, equal to a full f-stop increase in light gathering. This
sensor-shift system is unique to Apple and helps people capture everyday situations
with extraordinary images. And it delivers steady video with a truly cinematic feel.
Now here's my colleague Alok to tell you more about another feature we created for
our pro users.
{BIO 17063023 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-10-13
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 15 of 19Greg JoswiakThese are amazing cameras for pros, and we want to give our pros even more
control over the images they capture. Many pros love to capture in RAW, but they're
missing the beneﬁt of our sophisticated image fusion. So we'd like to show you a
sneak peek of a new feature that combines the control of shooting in RAW with the
power of our computational photography. And that's Apple ProRAW. This will be an
incredible feature for pros and will be available in the iPhone Camera app on iPhone
12 Pro and 12 Pro Max later this year. It provides many of the beneﬁts of our multi-
frame image processing and computational photography, like Deep Fusion and
Smart HDR, and combines them with the depth and ﬂexibility of a RAW format.
In order to achieve this, we constructed a new pipeline that takes components of the
processing we do in our CPU, GPU, ISP and Neural Engine and combines them into a
new Deep Image ﬁle computed at the time of capture without any shutter delay. And
we do this for all four cameras, dynamically adapting for various scenes, while
maintaining our intuitive camera experience. Things like sharpening, white balance
and tone mapping become instructions rather than being baked into the photo,
delivering full creative control over color, detail and dynamic range.
Here you can see a photo shot with Apple ProRAW. Notice how it's taken full
advantage of Deep Fusion to capture a wide range of light and shadow from
multiple exposures. Because all the data is contained in Apple ProRAW, this image
can be processed in various ways, while retaining the crisp, beautifully rendered
detail. You can edit Apple ProRAW directly in our Photos app and other professional
photo editing apps. We're also creating an API for third-party apps to capture
images in Apple ProRAW. This is really the best of both worlds. The ﬂexibility of RAW
with the power of Apple's computational photography.
And now, back to Joz.
{BIO 3260601 <GO>}
IPhone 12 Pro allows you to take absolutely stunning photos. Even at dusk, you can
see the incredible color and texture in the shadows. You can see this Ultra Wide shot
preserves the detail in the cracks of the desert ﬂoor. You can almost feel it. With
Deep Fusion, you can even see the detail of her dress in this low-light setting. In this
classic black-and-white, you can feel the sun glistening on the horse. On a tripod, we
can take night mode even further, capturing the pop of color in the tent as well as
the stars in the night sky.
Now let's talk about pro video. Year after year, iPhone provides the highest quality
video on a smartphone. Pros use iPhone to shoot TV shows, news reports and even
movies. This has never been more important, as our homes have become our
studios. In fact, for many TV productions, from American Idol to Mythic Quest, the
show has been able to go on because of iPhone. This year, we're taking pro video
further, much further. For the ﬁrst time, we're bringing HDR video recording to
iPhone. You can now record in 10-bit High Dynamic Range. This means we can
capture over 700 million colors. That's 60 times more colors than before. While you
capture, you get a live preview of your HDR content on the Super Retina XDRFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-10-13

do.
IPhone 12 Pro is the ﬁrst camera to record in Dolby Vision HDR. To accomplish this,
every single frame of 10-bit video runs through our ISP, generating a histogram and
allowing iPhone to grade each frame in Dolby Vision, live while you're recording.
And we can do this at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second. This is enabled by
our Apple custom sensor and the incredible power of the A14, which does the
intense processing of these image algorithms in real time.
Prior to today, you needed a pro studio lab and special equipment to edit your
original Dolby Vision footage and then re-encode your ﬁles. iPhone 12 Pro will be the
ﬁrst device to edit in Dolby Vision, right from the Photos app. You can even apply
ﬁlters. iPhone will regenerate the Dolby Vision tuning on the ﬂy. Oscar-winning
cinematographer Emmanuel Chivo Lubezki made a ﬁlm to showcase iPhone 12 Pro
with Dolby Vision, and I'd like to show it to you now.
(Video Presentation)
So iPhone is the ﬁrst and only device that enables you to capture, edit, watch and
share Dolby Vision video. What an incredible end-to-end pro video workﬂow, right
from your pocket. And with 5G, sharing your videos from the ﬁeld has never been
faster. And we have another exciting capability we're bringing to our new pro
iPhones.
Here's Francesca to tell you more.
{BIO 19151290 <GO>}
(Music Playing) We've pushed the industry with depth technology over the years,
and today we continue that innovation with a LiDAR scanner. LiDAR stands for Light
Detection and Ranging, and it measures how long it takes light to reach an object
and reﬂect back. We've adopted this technology for iPhone, and with the machine
learning and depth frameworks of iOS 14, iPhone understands the world around you
and builds a precise depth map of the scene. It enables object and room scanning,
photo and video eﬀects and precise placement of AR objects.
LiDAR makes iPhone 12 Pro a powerful device for delivering instant AR and
unlocking endless opportunities in apps. The LiDAR scanner also takes our pro
camera system to a whole new level. With LiDAR's ability to see in the dark, we use it
for autofocus in low-light scenes, improving accuracy to focus and reducing capture
time. Instead of hunting for focus, the LiDAR scanner can identify the subject, focus
and capture right away. This works in photos and videos. In fact, with LiDAR, we can
improve focus time in low-light scenes by up to six times, so your subject is clearly in
focus, without missing the moment. LiDAR also improves depth in low light for night
mode, enabling stunning night mode portrait shots like this one. Look at the
incredible detail in the face, the realistic color throughout the scene and theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-10-13

on iPhone 12 Pro.
Now back to Joz.
{BIO 3260601 <GO>}
As you can see, iPhone 12 Pro is loaded with incredible innovations. And when you
combine these advanced capabilities with 5G, it will enable you to do so much more
on the go. And 5G is going to unlock even more opportunities for our developers.
I'd like to show you a couple examples. On-call physicians often need to review
complex medical scans anywhere, anytime. OsiriX HD app and 5G enables them to
download these very large images with lightning-fast speeds. The ability to
download a full diagnostic scan in a matter of seconds versus minutes can make the
diﬀerence between life and death for a stroke victim. And enterprise will be able to
use private 5G networks for high reliability and low-latency apps.
Like JigSpace, which accelerates setup of complex work spaces. To set up a medical
device production facility, Medtronic would normally create a Six Sigma cardboard
layout of the space, taking weeks to design and costing tens of thousands of dollars.
And now, with 5G and the new LiDAR scanner, iPhone 12 Pro enables teams to
immediately map the environment and collaborate with their colleagues to instantly
place simulated equipment, adapt it to the room layout and outline process ﬂows.
JigSpace on iPhone 12 Pro enabled Medtronic to completely transform projects from
weeks to hours, reducing costs by more than 90%. We really pushed the limits with
iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max with stunning new designs and larger displays.
They're packed with our most innovative technologies like the A14 Bionic chip, LiDAR
scanner and incredible pro camera system powered by computational photography.
And now, here's a short ﬁlm we created about the iPhone 12 Pro
(Video Presentation).
A singular new design. A reengineered chip. And 5G. This is iPhone 12 Pro. The
vertical band is precision-machined from stainless steel. The Ceramic Shield on the
front is tougher than any smartphone glass. And tighter borders allow for even larger
Super Retina XDR displays. 5G is set to change the world with radically faster speeds.
The hardware and software have been optimized for the best 5G experience. A14
Bionic has a smaller, 5-nanometer transistor, which pushes the most powerful chip in
a smartphone generations ahead.
A new and improved pro camera system makes the 12 Pro the photographer's
iPhone. The larger iPhone 12 Pro Max pushes these innovations even further. Its
bigger sensor dramatically increases the detail captured and helps improve low-light
performance by 87%. The custom-designed LiDAR scanner puts advanced depth-
mapping technology in your pocket. You can now take a Night mode portrait andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-10-13

benchmark for highest quality video in a smartphone. And the movie industry can
now count on it as an essential piece of equipment.
It is the world's ﬁrst device able to capture, playback and edit 10-bit HDR footage
with Dolby Vision. iPhone 12 Pro comes in two sizes and in four ﬁnishes, including
new Paciﬁc Blue. An integral part of this year's design is MagSafe, an intelligent
system of magnets that connect accessories in a whole new way. All this and more
make the iPhone 12 Pro the most powerful iPhone ever.
{BIO 3260601 <GO>}
Even with all of these incredible pro technologies, we are keeping the price the
same as today, with iPhone 12 Pro starting at $999. And we're doubling the starting
capacity to 128 GB. And iPhone 12 Pro Max, with our best cameras ever, at $1,099.
We're rolling out 5G to more than 100 carriers around the world. This is our fastest
rollout ever. iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro will be available for pre-order this Friday,
October 16th, and available next week on October 23rd. iPhone 12 Pro Max and
iPhone 12 Mini will be available for pre-order starting on Friday, November 6th, and
they will begin shipping the following week, on November 13th. So this is our new
iPhone lineup, starting with iPhone SE at just $399, and iPhone 11 is now just $599.
