Before we dive into Q&A. Maybe, let's start with a brief description of your
background, kind of role at Microsoft and maybe what location you're joining us
from this morning.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26

Brent BracelinDoug, I want you kick things oﬀ here.
Sure. Hi, good morning everyone, and Brent, thank you for giving us the opportunity
to participate.
I'm Doug Burger. I am a long-time, formerly a researcher in computer architecture. I
was a professor at the University of Texas for 10 years, running a research group
there, and we built CPU processors, new types of hardware architectures in silicon. I
moved to Microsoft in 2008 and they started up research group in computer
architecture in Microsoft Research. And my team and I built a number of new things,
one of which was the Catapult FPGA platform, which forms the basis, measures smart
networking and accelerates applications in Bing. And it's -- that was actually a large
scale distributed system that we've built, not just the use of the chips.
And then about a year and three quarters ago, the company asked me to move most
of my team into Azure to really start a new direction as our cloud grows and
hardware innovations and full stack innovations become more and more important,
and then more recently, I take it on a more active role in AI architectures and
systems, and so that's really my focus now is AI infrastructure, the hardware and low
software level.
And so, that's what we've been doing.
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
Great. Very good. David?
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
Yeah, connected from Redmond. Actually, I'm connecting from probably a short
walking distance from the oﬃce, but is useless these days. So, I could be anywhere.
But yes, I'm in Redmond. I joined Microsoft almost 20 years ago and my background
is software development. So, I was attracted at that time, Microsoft was very famous
for Windows, right? But I was actually attracted to Microsoft because of the
developer tools, which is like the DNA for Microsoft. So, I held a variety of roles all
connecting, some of them in engineering, sign of the business, always connected
around the developer business. So, I used to lead the business for Visual Studio,
Visual Studio Online, Azure tools and so on. But then like ﬁve, six years ago, I noticed
that something was changing in the industry and it's that there is a new software and
that is called AI. So, I made a transition to AI, and now, I lead the AI Innovation team
in the business side in Microsoft.

{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
Well. That's the power of teams, right? We can all do this meeting virtually. So very,
very cool. So what's tied into the kind of current seat of AI to kind of frame the
discussion here. If you reﬂect back over the last year, what would you say where
some of the kind of landmark AI innovations that occurred, either across silicon or
systems or these new class of AI models? What were with the landmark things that
investors should kind of pay attention to in the last kind of year?
David, go ahead.
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
So, let's just start with the technology. So just recapping on build, so let's go to last
week, right. So, last week, we were -- I'm unsure that we will go in more detail today,
but one of the key things and it ﬂew a little bit under the radar. So you have probably
heard the term of the AI supercomputer that were announced last week, they
change behind us.
So the implications of that are far beyond hardware. So the key thing that we saw
with this AI supercomputers that you can train massive models, and by massive, I
mean in the billions of parameters of where we were in the order of the millions of
parameters. So that which can some very cool, that yeah, you can get better more or
less more accuracy, what it really meant and that is the key change that is certainly
something to be on top of is, how it's changing the way that you develop AI.
So, AI as a platform, what something that was not clear before. So, people,
companies will have to develop AI models on a case-by-case basis. What we realized
with this massive models is that they can be multi-task, they can be more generic
than the traditional, very customized, vertical models for speciﬁc scenario.
So, that will bring a very interesting motion in the market, which is companies
embracing this massive models and then customizing those models for their
particular scenarios and trust, therefore, bringing like state-of-the-art AI to more
companies, so that's certainly one thing that I would highlight To be on top, and that,
I ensure you can provide more in there, but before that, let me just mention another
thing also form last week that I think is very important, and I say concept of
autonomous systems.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 24Doug BurgerSo we had this chip, everybody that is also shooting autonomous assistance with
autonomous driving a lot of cases, but we're forgetting that autonomous systems are
much broader than that. And last week, what we announced our bill was our ﬁrst
preview, so every developer now have access to that, to our autonomous systems
platform. And it goes beyond motion control. It not only target robotics, but things
like process optimization, things like machine calibration and a lot of scenarios that
are much more, we are in the current situation for companies to address, so that's
another one that we had like.
Doug, I'm sure that you can add on top of both a lot.
I don't know, that was pretty -- that was great, very complete, let's see. So a couple of
things I might underscore with the -- in particular, with the AI supercomputer
announcement is really what David said that the size of the models has been
growing much, much faster than, I think, any of us predicted. I mean it was growing,
but now and just a round number is about 10X per year, which is a growth rate that
far surpasses Moore's Law, while it was active and we also have disrupted that was
over 50 years.
And so those giant models, what we've seen so far is that the bigger we train them,
the more they can do and that break through towards being able to train semi
supervised, especially the transformers in natural language. About a year and a half
ago, it really turned the ﬁeld in that domain from a data-bound problem into a
compute-bound problem, which is why we're now racing to build the
supercomputers, so that we can train these models in a reasonable amount of time,
days, weeks, months.
And it is very, very disruptive. When we look at the capabilities, these things are able
to drive not just in terms of language capabilities, but like David said, multi-modal
and what we're seeing is I think a very rapid infusion of AI across our product
families. Now, obviously the supercomputers are expensive. The infrastructure to do
them is, to train those large models is very diﬀerent than what people built in the
past.
And then, once you train them, you have to serve them into the models that are
giant. Serving them in real time is also challenging and can be expensive. So, I think
that that is a transition that I really don't think the industry has grasped yet or
appreciated how fast this is going to drive the capabilities of AI and how diﬀerent
the infrastructure needs to be with these 10x requirements.
Before we go into the architecture, because it does sound like there are some
unique things you're doing to create that AI supercomputer, I want to go back to the
comment you made around just the size of the models kind of changing. Is this at
the bleeding edge where it's kind of 1% of used cases? Or when you think about the
size of these models and moving from kind of data bound to compute bound
scenarios, is this more prevalent than maybe we appreciate it as outside looking in?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26

Brent Bracelin
David Carmona{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
Yeah, Doug, I'll take it. So there are two used cases here that I think we have to
separate very clearly, right. One, which is that 1% is companies that will be great in
those massive models, and we don't believe that that will be every company in the
planet. But interesting thing here is not actually building the model, it's that these
models as we were mentioning before, they are more generic, they are multi-model,
they are multi-task.
So you can centrally train those models, but then you can have companies with no
such deep expertise or access to this compute capabilities, customizing those
models for their own needs. Now, to give you an example, that's the way that we're
actually doing in Microsoft. So, we transitioned from having a broader by broader AI
approach, so you have Oﬃce creating their own models, you have Dynamics
creating their own models, you have Bing creating their own models.
To having a culture where we centralized the creation of these massive models and
then these teams can customize them, so we have features now in Oﬃce like auto
reply or like document summarization that are coming from customizing this model
without requiring that massive infrastructure and expertise. So, that's the two angles
that I would separate that.
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
And David, as you think about going from silo to centralized larger models. Is that
accelerating the feature, like what's the big beneﬁt. Is it the time to market with new
AI functionality or is it more advanced AI function?
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
I would say it's several, right. So the -- ﬁrst of all, let's go one by one. At least, I would
mention three. So the ﬁrst one super obvious is skills, right. So these are state-of-the-
art models that now everybody have access to. So you don't have -- so for example,
you will have the same level of almost, I would say, researcher's PhD creating those
models, because you can't reuse it. So that's one super important that will say a lot to
the democratization of AI in the industry.
The second one is data, so because these models are trained initially with huge
amount of data that is again central. In our case, we're trending with all the index
web being right, so huge amount of data that we're adding in there. Then, for
customizing those models, you don't need that a big amount of data. So for
example, in the case of Dynamics, they custom train that model within additional
data that are coming in their case, they do things like customer churn identiﬁcation,
so they only custom train the model with that delta, with their domain, right. So very,
very interesting.
And then, the third thing that I would say is compute power, so because the
customization is using our technical transfer learning, you don't need to train theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 24Doug Burger
David Carmona
Doug Burgermodel from scratch, so you don't need that huge amount of infrastructure required
to train the model initially.
Doug, am I forgetting any other thing that you will take?
I think that captured it very well. I would add one point. You asked about the model
size and you can think about the largest model that you can train in the billions and
we talked a little bit about that in our announcement. You can view that as the front
of the bad wave, that's all -- I wouldn't call it research, but it's really pushing the
envelope in the systems and the algorithmic techniques and the data management.
And then, you ﬁnd out what those models, what capabilities they have. And if you
take one quick down in size, that was radically large six months ago and those
models are now being used, just kind of throughout our infrastructure. So it's not -- I
don't really think of it as a bimodal distribution where there is like a 1% thing and
then there is everything else, the whole space is just moving very, very fast and
there's the new thing, the biggest thing at the Edge.
And then, things that were huge one year ago, kind of now empowering all the
products. And if you think about how fast this is happening and I think in the notes, I
mean it takes you years to build custom hardware, silicon and then build the systems
and deploy them, and so, if you need to make a major change in your hardware
platform, that's years before you can do it. And yet, this huge shift is less than two
years old and we're still pushing the envelope on the rate of growth.
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
Yeah.
And so in it, and so we're kind of doing whatever we can with whatever we can get
to drive the models up, and fortunately, we have made a lot of investments in the
past that were beneﬁting from now. A second comment I would make, if you think
about Microsoft from a strategy perspective in this, this goes onto something that
David mentioned. We have a very successful public cloud with infrastructure that
beneﬁts our customers.
We also have this massive PaaS and SaaS business that really empowers our
enterprise customers and consumers frankly within our oﬃce and teams and
changes there, like David was saying, can really reach so many people and transform
their business, and then those infrastructure changes that we made to get those
models out to such a wide group of users that see value, we can then take to our
infrastructure customers to use. And so, those two halves, I mean I think that's why
Satya talks about the Intelligent Cloud, it's not enterprise software and cloud, it's one
thing where beneﬁts can slosh back and forth and empower everyone.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26

Doug BurgerAnd I think we're really the top company that has the both of those halves in a very
strong position.
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
It is fascinating just seeing the pace of change in the space, that's hard outside
looking in to really fully appreciate it, all we get is from consumers of the technology,
we see that the advancements, right. We see small changes, the software is getting
smarter, right. But it's hard for us to quantify how dramatic things are changing on
the back end.
Let's drill down, and Harsh, you kind of weigh in here to the architecture of AI
supercomputer. I'm just trying to understand you've Azure and you can kind of build
your own kind of infrastructure to run your models on Azure, but now, you have this
AI supercomputer that's diﬀerent. So maybe walk through architecturally what's
diﬀerent about an AI supercomputer versus Azure, and why you need to kind of
think that this needs to be kind of optimized versus kind of building it myself
through my own APIs on Azure itself. So, walk us through just the architecture.
David, do you mind if I take the initial crack at that one?
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
All yours, you're the architect.
So ﬁrst of all, I think it's a mistake to view this as Azure and not Azure.
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
Yeah.
Okay. There is a lot of common infrastructure across both sides. But if you think
about like what you want for an IaaS customer, let's say a big enterprise IaaS
customer, what you need is incredibly high reliability availability, you want great
stability, you want predictable performance, you want access in many regions, it's
really a planetary computer and people build their infrastructure on our computing
utility and it has to stay up.
And then, now, if you go to the AI side and you're trading one of these large models,
you're running a single program or job over a massive number of -- massive
collection machines and it's okay for some of those notes to go down, right, because
you can build resilience into that large deal distributing system and we have a lot ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 24Harsh Kumar
Doug Burger
David Carmona
Doug Burgerexperience doing that, for example, with platforms like Bing, which has to stay up
and respond, but it doesn't matter if one note drops out, and so you're building a
distributed system that needs to complete the job as cheaply and as fast as possible,
but the reliability can characteristics of the components are very -- can be diﬀerent.
You need, for example, a lot more networking to train these giant models because
they're data intensive and the communication is global.
So your provision much more aggressive cross data center networking than you
need to for an IaaS customer. And obviously, there is a diﬀerent mix of hardware with
silicon components because you're doing your massive amounts of linear algebra.
But I do think that if you look at the high speed networking, the ability to
communicate quickly, the power requirements that you need to drive this, so just raw
performance. Those are all things that accrue to the core Azure business as well.
There's just an extreme point and then that business will follow along. We will beneﬁt
from the technological advancements that we're making.
{BIO 3235392 <GO>}
Sorry, I had two questions. Earlier, I want to go back about ﬁve minutes ago, I think
you mentioned or maybe David mentioned our transfer learning. Is that eﬀectively,
you would train this large data set and then you would give it to an enterprise data
center to run. Are we talking about something even smaller than that like running it
on a small chip at the Edge or are we still talking about kind of a data center type
process here?
David, why don't you take that one?
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
Yeah, both. So at the end, so these massive models, of course, they are, they are
thought to be run in the cloud, but at the same time, we see many scenarios where
through optimizations, the inﬂuencing of those models can be done at the Edge. So
they go side by side. So, yeah, absolutely.
Doug, anything that you add on top of that. technically?
So yeah, I think the way I view the transfer learning is there is building your base,
your model which is super expensive and then there's ﬂavoring it with speciﬁc data.
So just like an analogy, you might be -- everyone on the call here are speaking
English, but we all have slightly diﬀerent vocabularies and nuances and choice of
words, hence provide training in English more I could ﬂavor it with some history from
an individual to customize that model to the individual speech patterns.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 24Harsh Kumar
David Carmona
Doug BurgerAnd it's a lot, as David said earlier, it's a lot cheaper to do that ﬂavoring than build
the whole English model from scratch. And that's the training thing and then there's
a question of, do you deploy in the Cloud or the Edge, and I think that's a separate
question.
{BIO 3235392 <GO>}
And that's just absolutely incredible. My second question was on the preferred sort
of computational mode. Is Microsoft a fan of FPGAs versus GPUs or you simply don't
care? The common knowledge is that ASIC are cheaper, once you get the set sort of
-- once you get the parameters down a little bit on what you want to accomplish, you
always want to reduce the cost on computing down with ASIC, but I was just curious
what ﬂavor you guys prefer, Doug or David?
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
This one is for Doug.
Imagine, I get asked this a lot and so I'm not going to say Microsoft believes in
technology. Let me give you some framing that I think will help people understand
the space. Okay. So if you think about what you're doing in AI for these training
supercomputers, you're doing a massive amount of eﬀectively linear algebra.
And so you need an outstanding system architecture for low agency communication,
you need a robust software stack, you need resilience that this should in system
level, like we said. And then once you get out of the silicon, you've got a number of
trade-oﬀs, you've got sort of the eﬃciency of the silicon, like how fast can do X just
raw ﬂops, you've got the future-prooﬁng, if the model shifts, how well does the
silicon map on to that shift.
And then you've got other innovations that you might have in the hardware that
helped the model training that might help it to converge, like to save you cost. And
so, you've got this X set of trade-oﬀs and we actually invested multiple technologies.
We disclosed what the actually bigger is built on because that part has been really,
really great for training these large models.
And then, the second thing I would say is that I really don't like the term ASIC
because it's -- in this space, it's kind of gotten overused, meaning it just means
customer chip, right. And in the past, it meant something very diﬀerent, right. You're
building out a chip or a circuit for one purpose and what these things really are is
their programmable engines that do linear algebra ﬂexibly. And GPUs or FPGAs,
we've talked about our engagement with graft core, there is a ton of start-ups and
across Cloud and Edge, Intel, these are all programmable engines for AI-based
linear algebra. We have diﬀerent sets of trade-oﬀs in the eﬃciency of the math units
and the front end that feeds them and so there is just -- it's a new, what just like we
had CPUs for many, many years, this is kind of a new class of programmableFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26

Brent Bracelin
David Carmonaarchitecture that's emerging in a very rapidly evolving space. And again -- and so at
the end of the day, GPUs or FPGAs or what you called ASICs, they're all chips that
have a lot of math units on them, if our architectures could even.
{BIO 3235392 <GO>}
Thank you.
What that ultimately will look like, I don't think we know or at least we don't talk
about that side of the company.
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
We'll go back to that. We'll kind of try to get a diﬀerent angle on that because that's
a big question. But my question, just as we think about the industry pace of change
10x, we're thinking technology changes around Moore's Law every 18 months,
doubling transistors, but as you think about 10x every year, is there just a limited
number of companies that can keep up with that pace of change? How nervous
should investors be around things moving so fast that it's really going to be limited
number of companies that can manage that pace of change? Any thoughts, David,
as you just think about card rails that we kind of need to have in the industry and do
we have eﬃcient card rails there?
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
Yeah. I feel this is counter intuitive, but actually technology like this instead of limiting
the access to AI to fewer companies, it does the opposite. So it's opposite to more
companies. So let me elaborate on that. So we don't expect, I think we were
mentioned before companies to building this massive models from scratch all the
time, what we expect is the concept of AI as a platform. Just like what we had in the
past with the Internet, with then, of course, mobile, and now, with the Cloud. What is
the equivalent of that for AI. So if you look at how companies are developing AI
today, they are, I mean, their console of a platform is, I'm sorry, Doug, this is going to
hurt, but just leave it, in the sense that it is very close to having something very
speciﬁc for my solution, so I have to be on top of the platform to have something
customized for my solution, for my scenario.
And what we want to go is a place where AI can be good accessible like a platform,
so you can use these AI models and you customize those models for your particular
scenario. That's the big change that I've seen -- we will see coming very soon, right
down. This applies also, I know, we're talking a lot about NLP, natural language
processing, but this will apply to every other scenario.
So again coming back to the previous thing with autonomous systems, very, very
similar pattern that we see with autonomous system. So would you say that creating
an autonomous system is very limited to a few companies. Well, if you look at it fromFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 24Brent Bracelin
David Carmona
Brent Bracelin
David Carmonathe angle of building all the components from scratch like deeper reinforcement
learning, super complex technique that is not available for every enterprise to
address. Our approach is very diﬀerent, is to provide a platform abstracting on top
of those techniques like reinforcement learning. So companies can address, can
embrace autonomous systems by using their expertise on what they have expertise,
which is their business, right. So the same comparison it applies to many other
diﬀerent facets on AI that we are pursuing across the company.
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
Got it. It sounds like you're still with how you're moving from silo to more centralized
models available to all of the diﬀerent internal departments of Microsoft, you're
going to start to expose some of those same models externally on a kind of Azure
service basis. And so, you almost create a new -- a past layer for AI essentially, is that
the really...
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
Exactly, exactly.
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
And when was the timing around that? Is that something that's going to be like 2021,
2022 kind of opportunity where you're going to (multiple speakers)
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
I will go back to [ph]tax(\ph) position on it. So this is not like getting to the ﬁnish line.
So this is going to be -- so we'll see value being delivered in this journey right down.
The beginning was last week. So there is already a ton of value that companies got
used today. Because of that dual approach that we have in the company, which is I
would say, then three things. So when you look at our technologies, I would position
them in three diﬀerent states. So the ﬁrst thing that we do is being very open about
our innovation. So, for example, we open source these fragments, right. So that is, for
example, last week, we open source the key framework -- the key distributor
framework engine is called a deep speed to enable this training, right. So, that's
something very cool, right.
But then we're going to a phase where we infuse these models into our growth and
we already did that too, so you have a lot of features that are part of our products
that customers can get access today that are used in that manner. And then, the third
stage that it would highlight is how we also incorporate this into Azure for
developers to also build on top of that right. And we also have for that things like
Azure Connected Services which are there, these AI models that are served as a
service, right. So they are very easy to use by developers. So with those three things,
we cover the entire spectrum. And it's not that, hey, today, we are releasing
everything, right. So, it's that as we move, we make progress in this journey. Things
are getting infused into three main channels.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26

Fascinating. And my last question before we shift gears to kind of (multiple speakers)
Brent, I'm sorry. Could I add point onto that?
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
Yeah.
I think it's important for your investors. If you imagine today that I have a -- I started a
new company and I want to become a public cloud vendor, I want to build another
cloud business on my own infrastructure and compete with the big mega clouds.
The capital I need to raise, to deploy, to have -- to build these giant data centers and
have to be available around the world in many, many regions and the number of
software features that I need to provision and the number of SaaS and PaaS services
that I need to on board, it's just not achievable for a new entrant into the space, and
especially when you look at some of the advantages that some of the big players
have and I referred to our enterprise software business as well.
In the AI space, it goes directly to your question. You need to be able to build the
giant, the biggest supercomputers that the world has built to train these models. You
need to have really deep distributed systems expertise, you need a really, really
strong AI team that understands this, and so, the capital to do that as well and the
level of expertise and depth is also, I think, not quite at the point that you would have
to struggle to try and start it in the public cloud, but it's very large and growing.
And so just by deﬁnition, that's going to limit the number of players. We were able to
do this and Microsoft positions that we want to empower all our customers, like
David said, can give access to this technology, but the number of people, the
number of organizations that can build that infrastructure from the ground up, I
think, is going to be small.
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
That (inaudible) and kind of leads into my next question around OpenAI. Maybe
could you just walk through that, opening our relationship, you put, obviously, a
bunch of money there, a lot of really great talented engineers there, kind of
everything in OpenAI, so maybe just walk through that Microsoft OpenAI
relationship, what is it, and how does it relate to the AI supercomputer
announcement?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26

Brent BracelinI only say one -- I'll say two things, and I think David should weigh in.
I want to be judicious about commenting about a close partner. So number one,
OpenAI is among the most ambitious organizations in terms of what they're trying to
do with AI and their mission. And so, they, like our internal teams, push the
infrastructure very hard. Okay. I think, and given the scope of their ambition, the fact
that they chose to enter into this Microsoft partnership, I think it's a very, very strong
vote of conﬁdence for our infrastructure in our roadmap. That I think you can look at
and say, wow, one of the most ambitious AI organizations on the planet was willing
to sign this deal and commit to our infrastructure, that should tell you something
about our roadmap, which we don't publicize.
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
Very helpful. Anything else, David, do you want to weigh in there?
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
Yeah, I think coming back to Doug's points before, right, in the sense that in order to
serve these massive models, you need to deal just to throw a number in there. So,
the AI supercomputer that one-oﬀ last week ago is actually, it became immediately
the number ﬁve supercomputer in the world. Right. So that's a sign of the scale that
you need there.
So to deal a system like that and the other companies that I do all the time is that you
should look at this has the formula one, right. But then, all the innovation that you're
doing that formula one, you make it available to the typical card that we use every
day. So the same thing we're doing with this investment.
So it's not only about creating this AI supercomputer to build this massive model
that we believe will be the foundation for that AI platform that we were mentioning,
which is only will be available for a few vendors, who can really have the capital on
that, but then, the other thing is how we are thinking all of that innovation infusing it
into Azure for everyday Azure, right. So, that's the other big aspect to consider in
this.
That's right. And just to underscore that point, Brent, I'm sorry, I'll sign up in a minute,
think about what David just said, just largest supercomputer in the world with the
models growing 10x per year, just think about the implications of that for a minute
and where this is likely to be.
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}

No, I was outweighed actually. I had a question on quantum computing, but I'll wait
for you to ﬁnish.
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
Let's shift gears to kind of more of a enterprise reality. The enterprise reality is we're
going through a pandemic. We have work from home, it feels like this is an
environment where you could see things and AI product start to pause and slow, so
what are you seeing kind of in this post pandemic environment relative to kind of AI,
the appetite for AI, is it slowing, is it accelerating, just walk us through what you're
seeing there?
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
Do you want to take this one, Doug?
Go ahead.
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
(multiple speakers) Yeah, please be on top of that. Yeah. So there is something, I
have to say even before the pandemic, we were seeing a change in the conversation
with enterprises. So I remember, maybe four, ﬁve years ago, every conversation that
you have with our customer was about, hey, what is this AI fee, should I be on top of
that, right. Then, the next thing then ﬁnally companies realize, okay, this is big, I need
to embrace AI if I want to transfer my business, but the next thing was how do I get
started. And we saw a lot of adoption in the enterprise, but in the ﬁrst phases of that
adoption, right, so many pilots, many proof of concept, et cetera. From that time to
now, we've been seeing that shifting in the market to really how do I have funding
back in the business, how do I move beyond the proof of concept, how do I connect
AI with business outcomes.
So that conversation was really happening, and this pandemic, this global crisis, what
it has done on this conversation is accelerating it even more. So, we've seen our
customers just cutting to the chase, telling us, hey, what I need now is putting AI into
action and I need it now. We usually have that conversation in two fronts, right. One
is for the current crisis of (technical diﬃculty) AI tool let me deal with the disruption,
buying experiencing today but then, even in the longer term, we know that we're
never going back to the previous normal. It's going to be a new situation with a lot of
economic uncertainty with a lot of care on how do I optimize the revenue, how do I
optimize my operation, et cetera in my company. So how AI can help me there.
So in the ﬁrst one, let me maybe, I think your question was more on the ﬁrst one,
right. Is it more today what our companies doing with AI so how is AI helping in theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 15 of 24Doug Burgerdisruption that we are experiencing and we see three primary scenarios. So, these
are the three used cases that we actually saw our race on the demand from our
customers, and we see that across the industry, so not for a particular vertical.
The ﬁrst one, which is very obvious is of course customer service, so that is the most
visible one, right. So, companies that were, in many cases, piloting using AI to
streamline their customer service, they are accelerating those projects like, we see
examples of companies that have been working for 18 months on a project and then
with the current crisis, they put it in production in two days, right. So that the
acceleration that we see in some cases, and that goes in many cases, deﬁnitely
customers support, so you have like a perfect storm with more request from your
customers. But at the same time, your operations are being impacted by the crisis,
but in other cases, we're seeing broader scenarios like really being able to identify
your best customers, being proactive, personalizing your service to those customers.
So we see that across a number of customers and I'm happy later if we have time to
go into some examples for companies, and that's one scenario. The other one that
we see hugely happening in this crisis of course business process optimization. And
I'd like to separate that into, what we see that, the ﬁrst thing that customers are
noticing is that processes that were very established in the past, now they have been
disrupted dramatically. So, think of supply chain, right, think of forecasting demand.
So, all fraud detection, customer churn, those processes are dramatically diﬀerent
right now. So they need to put in place processes that are more agile, that they are
more ﬂexible to those changes, and AI is a solution that is helping in that area. So
that's one thing.
The other thing of course is speciﬁcally because of the economic situation, we see
customers looking for cost savings right down, that in business processes, that
means a lot and we see many customers that are using AI to shorten their business
process, to streamline business processes and to make them more productive. So
that's the second scenario.
And the third one that we see a lot because of another perfect storm, right now, is
employee productivity. So I think it's, of course, (technical diﬃculty) but it goes
beyond that. So we see another perfect storm with very, very, very complex situation
that employees have to deal now from the business point of view, but there an
impacted productivity because of the current situation. So we see companies
looking at AI to how they can in the short term increase that employee productivity
and we see many, many examples of those. So those are the three.
Doug, I don't know if you want to add something on top of that, but we can go
deeper into examples, if you want to, later.
Yeah, I thought that was super interesting. It was even interesting for me and I mean
the company, so thank you, David. I would just underscore what David said. What
we're seeing is that this crisis is accelerating company's desire to do digital
transformation partially because they need to and partially because if you're goingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26

to be company that will help people solve problems through digital transformation.
And so, I think it's opportunity with our infrastructure and our services to really help
our customers.
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
And as you think about the types of kind of AI used cases that seem to be kind of
resonating most right now, you give three examples. Is it kind of NLP? Is it text-
speech, computer vision, all of the above? Is there one type of AI that's really like, oh
my god, it's taken oﬀ much faster than I would have thought.
David, go ahead.
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
I think all of them, but if I have to pick a favorite right now, that's NLP. So, NLP is right
now in a very hot moment because of this acceleration being especially relevant to
an area that was very tricky such as NLP. So, NLP is very complex, it requires
generalization. It is very, very complex to solve, and with this new state of their
models, we see huge potential in that. But in the examples that I said before, NLP is
there, but we see all the techniques of AI across the board.
{BIO 3235392 <GO>}
David, I can vouch that it's been about nine months since I have spoken to a live
person without speaking to a machine ﬁrst.
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
I think we all experience that. Absolutely. Can't -- we have about 15 minutes here left,
what I think it'd be helpful is to maybe get an update on Project Brainwave.
Obviously, Doug, I think the last time we met, we kind of was about three years ago
and get a kind of a deep dive, love to understand, and maybe Harsh is probably
better here to go down this, but I'll turn it over to Harsh to get maybe an update on
Project Brainwave.

minute overview on what you're trying to accomplish with Project Brainwave. And

Doug BurgerDavid, do you want me to take this?
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
Doug, that's for you.
Okay. So we, the project is continuing, it's continuing to go super well, we're using it,
continue to use it at scale worldwide to serve the models that we trend. Like I said,
we deﬁnitely have a mix of technologies in our infrastructure, and with that program
in particular, we're able to do -- incorporate innovations fairly rapidly to really push
what the models on the serving or inference side are capable of doing.
I think we have really focused on our internal businesses because that's where the
need is pressing if you think about the need to serve these giant models, and the
latency in the cost, the expense, that's where a lot of innovation is required. I don't
want to talk too much more about it, but we are going to be seeing more publicly
this year.
So that would be a chance to get updated then.
{BIO 3235392 <GO>}
And one term that we hear a lot and we obviously see as in Hollywood movies and
stuﬀ like that as well is quantum computing. I was curious since you guys are some of
the top leading experts in the country on AI, I was wondering, is it quantum
computing even applied AI in some manner, or is it useful for completely diﬀerent
things? And if so, how do you guys feel about the potential for that maybe
commercializing in the next ﬁve, 10, how many every years if it's out that long?
I would -- David, do you mind if I start with this?
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
Yeah. You take it.
So, there is certainly an overlap between the two in the research community looking
at doing machine learning with quantum algorithms and quantum-capable
algorithms. What I would say right now, my personal view, I'm not speaking for the
company here, is that initially the two technologies, AI supercomputers and quantumFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26

Brent Bracelinsystems, will be targeting diﬀerent applications, but the things you can solve with a
lot of the quantum algorithms are just very diﬀerent problems than what we're doing
with these large-scale AI models. Eventually, there may be some convergence, but
where quantum, I think, will do best initially is in problems that have huge compute
requirements, but not a lot of state, simply because of the diﬃculty of keeping larger
massive state in the superimposed domain. And if you look at the amount of state
we're driving to train these models, it's massive. So, I think of them is disruptive
technologies that are initially attacking diﬀerent classes of problems. And then
theoretically, there is possible for overlap in the longer term.
{BIO 3235392 <GO>}
And Doug, when you say state, what exactly do you mean? I'm not familiar with that.
Just information, bits.
{BIO 3235392 <GO>}
Okay. I got it.
How many bits of state do you hold in one computer. Is it a 1,000, is it a 10,000? It's
not the petabytes of data we're operating on in the Azure for computer space.
{BIO 3235392 <GO>}
But it sounds like we're far away, it's the best way to think about quantum computing
is at least a couple of years away, if not more.
I don't want to take a position on the quantum roadmap. I would say that for large-
scale AI, I think we're pretty far away in the quantum space.
{BIO 3235392 <GO>}
Brent, do you have anything?
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
Yeah, so let's shift gears a little bit maybe and talk about kind of some real world
used cases. We've covered a lot of ground here, you gave us some scenarios, how
people are using it, but you just recently announced NDA, you announced all sorts
of kind of new used cases, I think, at build last week and two weeks coming up to
build around some new large enterprises, where AI was Microsoft AI, Azure AI. I thinkFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 19 of 24Doug Burger
David Carmonathere's like 20,000 enterprises that have deployed Azure AI at some point in the last
year. But walk through how people are actually using it, other interesting scenarios
that you come across that you'd like to highlight for us to take the technology in the
real world scenarios?
This is a question for David.
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
Yeah. I take that one, Doug. I would use the frame that I was using before, but I
would add one component. So the frame that I was using before was those three-key
scenario. So like I can go through is like canonical examples in there and even bring
some of the real customers that are in those three scenarios, but then I would add an
additional one, which is the post COVID-19 moment, right.
So that's the moment where we will see companies reimagining again in this
completely new normal that will experience there and I can bring some examples of
things in that area as well. So let's start with today. Let's start with customers that are
using AI today for those three scenarios. So we started with customer service.
Customer service is a very easy one because it's weird to ﬁnd a customer that is not
now using AI for their customer service, and in general, their customer engagement,
right. So, we have many examples. I think the most exciting one that we announced
last week was actually in the healthcare area. So, in Microsoft, as you know, not only
we provide the platform for customers to create, for example, bot to the user with
customer service, but we also provide SaaS solutions that they can use directly for
those solutions for those scenarios. So, one in particular is called the Azure
Healthcare Bot Service, and it is a vertical bot that health organizations can use today
for their customer service, in this case, their patient service. So, what we have seen in
the last month is an exponential usage of that service. So just to give you a sense, we
have seen 1500 health organizations between public health organizations or health
providers, et cetera, that are implementing new projects. So think of that, 1500 new
projects that were put in production, speciﬁcally for COVID-19 management. Those
bots that are being deployed in just these few weeks, they have a reach of 30 million
people.
So think of the scale of that, right, so -- and they provided a huge tool to really
unload, to reduce some of the load that we were seeing in health professionals like
doctors and nurses to have a ﬁrst level interaction with patients. It was a self-
assessment tool that patients can take in order to be redirected then to the right
resource, right. So that would be one example that I will bring.
In business process optimization, we have seen -- I don't know where to start there,
because again, every company is doing a lot in that area. So one, I think you
mentioned that one, but one of the ones that we announced last week was FedEx.
Like FedEx is the perfect example of business process optimization.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 20 of 24So they had this massive amount of data, so they have a very granular data on their
shipments in FedEx. So, with this agreement, they are going to have AI on top of that,
so they can have better intelligence on what is going on. So they can not only
identify trends that are happening or products that are happening, but also to
optimize that supply chain right in their organization. So really, really a perfect
example of business process optimization. If I could see everywhere, I can think of
IndiaLends is another customer. IndiaLends is underwriting a credit platform in India
for like 50 banks in India and what they did in their case is using AI for their credit
approval system and they were able to decrease the time -- the processing time --
the internal processing time for credit approval 50%, which in this times imagine the
impact of that is having the ability to process twice the number of credits, right, in
these -- in a moment like this, which is absolutely critical.
Manufacturing, we have seen also many examples. I think I mentioned this one
before, where we see companies are starting to use autonomous systems, not for the
moonshot of autonomous driving, but things like motion control or process
optimization in manufacturing that are getting big results from day zero, right. And
we see many customers in that front. What is going to bring in there. Well, you tell
me a business process optimization. Actually, we saw it also in healthcare where we
have such a limited resourcing, as we have right now. It is critical to things like
medical supplies, even hospital beds are optimized with things like AI. So very, very
typical.
The other one that I mentioned was employee productivity. So let me bring just a
couple of examples in there. So one generic, we see that a lot is AI working with
humans to outman their productivity. So, just to give you an example of that, Reuters.
So in the case of Reuters, you have -- again, you have their journalists that are doing
what they do, which is writing articles. And in this case, they were using AI
supporting them, so they can attach relevant videos to those articles. And not only,
they have to go through that very manual process of ﬁnding relevant videos, but
they also -- by using AI, they also increase the average completion rate 80% with this
technique, right. So, not only better employee productivity, but then a better result.
The other one that I would mention that is very connected to that is not only don't
think of employee productivity only removing like tedious tasks or repetitive tasks.
It's also about making better decisions. So the other example that I will bring in here
is Team Rubicon. They are managing their more than 100,000 volunteers in the US
for COVID-19. So think about the massive scale of the solution required for that. I
mean in their case, they are using AI to really identify and optimize the deployment
of volunteers across the US. So, very important work that is really about making
better decisions. So, those were just a few examples on the ﬁrst part, how companies
are using AI in the response rate.
But let me just use a couple of examples on their imagine phase, right. Because I
think that is the big conversation that we should how, what is going on after after this
health crisis over and it turns into an economic crisis, right. And, we see three key
things happening in there. So let me use an example in there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 21 of 24Brent Bracelin
David CarmonaThe ﬁrst one that we talk a lot today was AI that scale. So I know that we talk a lot
about AI scale in the concept of the model. But there is a bigger motion that will
happen in the enterprise, that is really applying AI at scale in their business. So, it's
moving from that pilot phase to re-infuse it into everything that they do. And for that,
the key thing in there, I will bring an example right now, is how you need to scale the
usage of AI across your business units and moving beyond your technical units. So
we see that business being more connected to the AI transformation than it was
before. That is something that will happen certainly as we move into this phase. And
an example, I would bring in here of course the key thing. I think the key lesson here
is that we have gone through that before with software development. So remember
this conversation 10 years ago we were having it for software. And we knew how to
do that. It was called DevOps, and it was all about bringing developers to technical
units and the business together in a combined life cycle. We don't have that for AI.
So you have technical units that are working in silos in this pilot, but they are not
being infused into the business. So the equivalent for DevOps in AI is called MLOps
and we see that as a huge trend moving forward.
And an example, I will bring in here that we just published is the Department of
Transit in Vancouver. In their case -- so think of this case, we talk a lot about the size
of the models, but what about the number of models that you need to transform an
industry, to transfer your company. In the case of this company, they have 18,000
models. So think of the number of models, think of managing those models. There is
no way that you can do that with just a silo technical unit doing that, right. So they
brought together the business and the technical units with a common MLOps
process that is across all of that. So that will be one. I know that I'm talking a lot here,
but let me just go through the other two, because I think it's important.
The second one is regarding...
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
We've got one minute drill and we have to we've to conclude.
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
One minute, I'll do it in a half-a-minute. But the second one that I want to mention is
how the next step in this transformation is to empower the business. So we have
talked a lot about technical units developing this AI, but the next step and we made
very big steps in Microsoft is to empower the business. So they can also apply AI,
right, with things like the Power Platform, with Dynamics 365. We see that as a reality
moving forward, and then, one example that I will bring here is Novartis. So Novartis,
a pharmaceutical as you know, so we just -- like a year ago, we signed an agreement
with them where they are basically empowering their 50,000 employees.
So, almost half of their employees with AI, but don't think of it as using AI, but more
as applying AI with ﬂexibility with freedom to their processes. So you can have
researchers that are researching new drugs or new treatments or new vaccines and
how they can be augmented with AI by using in their processes to drugFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-26

Doug Burgermanufacturers any cellular matter expert. So that's a huge motion that we will see
moving forward.
And the third one, and this would be my last one, is let's not forget our Responsible
AI. So we see Responsible AI, we have this conversation for many years are really and
we are seeing also a huge shift in the conversation front, hey, what are the
challenges of AI, what are your principles of Microsoft to now, AI under a huge risk
as I accelerate my adoption of AI, help me to implement that AI Responsible, so I can
mitigate those risks.
So we have many examples in here, but just to read one, TD Bank, the bank in the US
from Canada. You can see how they're using Responsible AI to mitigate things like
bias or things like adding more transparency to the models that they are deploying.
{BIO 2447337 <GO>}
Thank you, David. I just -- you guys have so much to talk about AI. Jonathan's
extended this conversation for another hour, I'm just kidding. Last question for me,
Doug, as you think about the pace of change here, tax in the last year on the
modeling side, what are you most excited about, thinking about the AI industry and
Microsoft opportunity in the next three years? One thing, what's the one thing you're
most excited about?
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
Are you thinking, Doug?
David, I need to give that some thought.
{BIO 21505148 <GO>}
I keep going back to the concept of really putting AI into action. So the concept of
democratizing AI, I know that it's not so technical, but there's a lot going on to
empower that motion that we're doing, because it goes beyond just the
infrastructure of the software, it's really about our comprehensive solution from
research to the three clouds, to our tools, right. So, really, really powerful if we get
there in the next year.
