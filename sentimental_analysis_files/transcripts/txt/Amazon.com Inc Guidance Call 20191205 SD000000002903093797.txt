{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Thank you, guys. And thank you for coming. I appreciate it's been a great week here
at re:Invent. And we appreciate your spending some time with us today.
So sports, to me, is an amazing storytelling forum. And if you think about -- if you're a
sports fan -- I'm a very passionate sports fan, a New York sports fan because I'm from
New York. It's an incredible roller coaster of emotions. You get to see giants face oﬀ
against each other. You get to see David versus Goliath. You've huge upsets. You
have heartbreak and agony. You have euphoria. You have all of those emotions. And
it's also an amazing way to bond. Some of my very best memories in my life are
going to New York Giants games and New York Rangers games with my dad. I still
remember the conversations we had going to the stadium back and forth, just has
been a bond. Even if my dad is now 82, we go to sports events all the time. And it's
something we share and have shared our whole life. And I share it with my son as
well.
And I also think it's an amazing community builder. I think in a world like we live in
today, where there's so much polarization, one of the few places where people from
every background and every political view come together as one in a community isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-05

Roger Goodellwhen you're rooting for a sports team. So sports, I think, has an incredible place in
our society.
And in AWS, we've been helping various sports teams, sports broadcasters and
leagues use AWS for digital transformation and changing their fan experiences and
changing their analytics and machine learning for a long time. We've done it with
baseball and hockey and basketball and car racing and sailing. And of course, with
football as well. And one of our -- I think one of the most sophisticated organizations
in sports and out of sports and how they use technology and evolve their customer
experience has been the NFL. And it's been really an honor and a privilege for us to
work with the NFL on a number of dimensions over a bunch of times.
So to share more about our partnership together, it's my privilege to welcome to the
stage, the Commissioner of the NFL, Roger Goodell.
{BIO 1817738 <GO>}
Hi, Andy. Thank you.
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Thanks for being here, Roger. I appreciate it.
{BIO 1817738 <GO>}
Yes. My pleasure.
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
So thanks for coming. I appreciate it.
{BIO 1817738 <GO>}
My pleasure. Glad to be here.
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Football is the most popular sport in the United States and increasingly around the
world. And if I think about the way that you have relentlessly worked on changing
the customer experience as a fan experience over the last number of years, it's
remarkable. I remember as a kid growing up, I mean, if you watch TV, you actually
didn't know what the score was. You kept waiting until they ﬂash the score. And there
was no yellow line for the ﬁrst down mark. Are we just -- it's radically diﬀerent. And I
think a lot of that...

{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Yes, I remember that. I'd be calling sports phone every 5 minutes, paying $1 a minute
to hear the scores. Actually, better said, my dad was paying a $1 a minute at that age.
But you radically changed the customer experience. And we love what we've been
working on with you for a while and Next Gen Stats.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Share kind of how that's evolved and how you've used Next Gen Stats and other
innovations to change the fan experience.
{BIO 1817738 <GO>}
Well it's all about trying to bring the fan closer to the game and give them some
other way to engage with the game. And they want access, of course. But they want
information. And AWS has been able to work with us with Next Gen Stats to be able
to give us insight that we never had before: how fast a player is running; the
separation that a receiver and the defensive back may have; probability of a catch,
we saw some of that up on the screen just before we started. And I think the fans
have really taken to that. And our broadcasters have taken to that. Media partners
have been really interested in how you take this new data and make it a better
production and make the fan feel like they're more a part of the game and
understanding it. And when you get an opportunity to see somebody running 22
miles an hour, which I think is the record this year, according to AWS. And that's -- I
don't know the last time you ran 22 miles per hour.
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Not recently.
{BIO 1817738 <GO>}
Not recently. So -- but you see that. And you really take away that these are
incredible athletes doing incredible things. And that's, I think, the power of what
we've created with you all. And I think there's so many more opportunities beyond
that for us.
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
I agree. One of my very favorite of the Next Gen Stats is that catch probability metric.
And I love -- as a New York Giants fan, I love that Next Gen Stats is able to use the
machine learning algorithms created in AWS to project that famous OBJ catch, the
Odell Beckham Jr. catch, against Dallas had a 0.4% catch probability, which means
eﬀectively, 4 out of 1,000 times, he would catch the ball, which is pretty amazing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-05

Q - Roger Goodell
A - Andrew JassyAnd as Roger said, we've spent a lot of time together as our organizations and
continuing to work on how we can evolve the game and be a part of changing
things. And we -- we've looked at what we were doing together and said, "Are there
other things that we can do to move the needle?" And so we talked a lot about that.
We said, "What can we do with AWS' cloud computing and machine learning
capabilities with what the NFL has, both with regard to historical and current data
and insight into the game?" And we're excited to announce a new strategic
partnership together, which is going to combine AWS' cloud computing and
machine learning with the NFL's data and insight into the game to work on
transforming player health and safety.
And so we're excited about what's possible there. And I thought it would be useful
for you to help us understand how is the partnership and what we're going to do
together build on what you've already been doing. It's, obviously, a big priority for
the NFL and has been for a long time.
{BIO 1817738 <GO>}
Well it's our #1 priority. How do we make the game safer for our current players,
obviously, of -- for the next-generation of players. And frankly, well beyond the game
of football?
We think what we do here will make every sport safer and frankly, even beyond that.
But for us, what we see the power here is to be able to take the data that we've
created over the last decade or so with that not only extraordinary distant it's pure
data. But it has video attached to it. And we now have sensors. And when you can
take the combination of all of that, I think the possibilities are enormous. And that's
what you guys specialize. You -- that's what you guys do.
We're pretty good at football. We're pretty good at collecting that data. But we want
to use that data to now change the game. And I think that's what's exciting to me
about this relationship. There are very few relationships that we get involved with,
where the partner and the NFL can change the game. And it'll be changing the way
it's played, it'll be the way it's coached, the way we prepare our athletes for the
game. And although that is, I think, going to be something that's going to be very
exciting as we look to the next 100 years of the NFL.
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Yes. We're excited about it as well and the potential for it. And this is, obviously, an
important strategic priority for you. Just to share a little bit how you thought about
who to partner with. And what the process was like?
{BIO 1817738 <GO>}
Well you'd be happy to hear. When we're looking at partnerships, we always look for
best in class. So that is a compliment to AWS.

{BIO 1817738 <GO>}
And it is how we believe in. When we look at the landscape, we wanted to go with
the best in class. So that's #1 for us. Two is we really feel strongly about trying to align
our interest with that partner. You bring great technology. You bring great machine
learning, stuﬀ that we don't have in the NFL. So we want to be able to work with you
to make 1 plus 1 equal 5. And so we believe that will work very well for us. Then we,
obviously, just want, at the end of the day, to have an impact. We want to know that
in this relationship, we can impact AWS, we can impact the game and we can
together do something very powerful.
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Yes. In my keynote on Tuesday, which I'm sure you watched on a livestream, yes.

I did see that.

You told me it was 2.5 hours, Andy. I watched it on the (ﬂight homes).
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Yes. Along with (St. Dodo). In the keynote, one of the things we talked about is that
when you're making a big transformation, it really starts foundationally with the
leaders deciding that they want to make that transformation and setting aggressive
goals from the top down.
And one of the things I've always been impressed about you, Roger, is that you're
super curious about technology. Really, I think you're quite happy with where the
game is. But also, every time we talk, you're thinking about how to change the fan
experience and how it can be better and leaning into it. And that's, by the way -- I
mean, I would say I get a chance to meet with lots of leaders and lots of industries.
And you would think that would be the norm. But it's not. And I really appreciate it
about you. And I'm just curious how you think about innovation and how the league
thinks about innovation.
{BIO 1817738 <GO>}
Well it's sort of -- I was giggling because you said -- and I know my staﬀ would giggle
with you, is that I seem very happy with where we are with the game. I am never
happy or satisﬁed with where we are. I always feel like the NFL, in particular, has so
much more potential. And we have to unlock that potential. And I think that's what
this relationship can do is unlock all of the work that we've done in building thisFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-05

Q - Roger Goodelldatabase and actually work to extend our eﬀorts to, obviously, prevent injuries, to
diagnose injuries and to treat injuries; and to come up with better medical
standards. And better practice methods and better equipment.
You're going to hear from the engineers in a few minutes. And the work that they've
been able to do to create this engineering road map to improve the game is having
dramatic impact. We've already seen it in a reduction of concussions of 30% last
year. We're continuing to see how we can do that with lower extremity injuries, which
are really the bulk of the injuries. And we believe we can do that by combining it in
this partnership to make sure we understand how the injuries occur and what we
could do to prevent them. Even to a point, as you know much better than I do, could
we create the Digital Athlete? Could we ﬁnd out more about predictive analysis that
will allow us to understand, is it possible this individual is more susceptible to an
injury? Maybe on the surface, or in these cleats or at that position.
So all of that is exciting for us. And it's not far away. And it's something we think is in
our grasp. In this relationship, I believe, we will accelerate that.
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Yes, I agree with you. I think, it's -- some of the things I'm excited about that we're
going to do together is just using computer vision algorithms. And then alongside of
things like...
{BIO 1817738 <GO>}
You're going to get over my head real quick.
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
I am. But alongside some of the services like SageMaker we have where we build
algorithms to try and predict what causes concussions and lower extremity injuries
and the Digital Athlete that you mentioned, too, just creating a virtual composite
model of athletes. So you can understand -- you can simulate diﬀerent collisions and
diﬀerent angles and diﬀerent types of plays and what it looks like for a normal gate
of a player versus somebody who's maybe be impacted by injury. It just, I think, has
the chance to really transform player health and safety.
And so super excited about the partnership and excited about what we're
embarking on together today. And as Roger said, we're going to call up some of the
experts now. And I'm going to welcome to the stage -- I'm going to welcome Jeﬀ
Miller, who's the Executive Vice President of Health and Safety Innovation for the
NFL; Dr. Matt Wood, who's the VP of AI Services here in AWS; and Dr. Jeﬀ Crandall,
who's the Chairman of the Engineering Committee for the NFL. And they're going to

{BIO 22261500 <GO>}
Good afternoon. I'm Jeﬀ Miller, Executive Vice President for Health and Safety
Innovations at the NFL. And I can testify to the fact that Roger Goodell is relentlessly
unsatisﬁed.
We're going to continue the conversation that we started a few minutes ago. I want
to thank Andy Jassy, AWS, the team that we've had an opportunity to work with as
we've developed this partnership over the last few months. We could not be more
excited about what the future holds for football, for the health and safety of our
athletes and for the game as a whole.
With that, let me introduce a couple of our special guests who are going to get into
some of the detail around this work. This is Matt Wood, who is Vice President for
Artiﬁcial Intelligence here at AWS; and a good friend of mine, Dr. Jeﬀ Crandall,
who's the Chairman of the NFL's Engineering Committee and a Biomechanical
Engineer at the University of Virginia.
+++qanda
Jeﬀ, let me start with you. We know each other well, have worked together for a long
time. About 3.5 years ago, the NFL started a project that we called the Engineering
Roadmap, which was an eﬀort supported -- a multimillion dollar eﬀort supported by
our owners to try to better understand head impacts and concussions on ﬁeld and
then design ways to mitigate those impacts, to try to move the helmet industry
forward. And that work has been intensive. I think that we've seen a fair number -- a
fair amount of success from it.
Jeﬀ, you've been at the point person for doing this work. Can you share with the
audience a little bit about the eﬀorts so far?
{BIO 1773143 <GO>}
Sure. I think it's important to understand where we're starting from. I think if you look
at the NFL, collects a tremendous amount of high-quality data. And most of you are
probably familiar with what they share about the play and the game information. But
I think it goes right down to the player level. We have tremendous information on
the equipment that players are wearing. What are the helmet models? What are the
cleats? What are the shoulder pads? We know the player injury and their history. We
know what's happening, how often they practice. We know what they're doing on
ﬁeld. We know the surfaces they run on. So we've got a tremendous database
prepared. And I think on top of all that, one of the most unique resources, if youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-05
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 8 of 13Q - Jeﬀ Millerlook, is the archives of video. So not only do we have the game characterized with
every play where we have multiple views of cameras. Now what we have is every
player actually tracked with multiple views of cameras and angles. And so building
on this, we developed a plan called the Engineering Roadmap. And the goal of that
was really how do we transform. How do we improve the current state of head
protection? How do we accelerate that and do it at a pretty rapid pace? And so what
we did is we put a plan together. It was part of $100 million initiative that the league
funded a couple of years ago.
What we did is we set up 4 basic tasks. The ﬁrst task was, let's understand what's
happening on ﬁeld. Let's characterize the environment when players are getting
injured. So what we did is we took video. We took the Next Gen Stats that you just
saw. We did something called model-based image matching. And we really
characterized who is getting injured, how they were getting impacted, what they
were being impacted by. Then from an engineering basis, what we did is we've said,
"What are the forces? What are the motions involved when players are injured?" So
once we have that information, we characterize the on-ﬁeld. Then the next step is
how do we share that. How do we share that with people that can actually make
better helmets, better protective equipment? And so what we did is we took that
information. We brought it into a laboratory setting. And that laboratory setting
meant we had to recreate that on-ﬁeld environment using impactors and crash test
dummies that manufacturers could then take in their laboratory and design to. So
essentially, designing with this equipment let you reﬂect the on-ﬁeld environment.
And I think if you look at the state of aﬀairs of design right now, it's no longer a world
where you take a prototype and you test it experimentally. So another work stream
we did was let's bring this to a computational environment. Let's use ﬁnite elements.
Let's recreate that environment that we studied on ﬁeld in a virtual space. And so
we're at a point now where we understand what's happening on ﬁeld. We have the
tools, both experimental and computational. The next step is how do we incentivize
and motivate the development of these transformational helmets.
And so last month, a group of us had a symposium, where we kicked oﬀ a $3 million
NFL helmet challenge. We really want to motivate and incentivize manufacturers,
entrepreneurs. We brought all of them together with the nation's leading additive
manufacturers' 3D printing.
And so we're hopeful over the next 18 months that we get to a transformational, a
revolutionary element that is better substantially than anything that's on ﬁeld right
now. And so that's essentially where we are with the Engineering Roadmap.
{BIO 22261500 <GO>}
And one element that I had not anticipated when we started this work was the
collection of the diﬀerent data sets, not just the head impacts on ﬁeld but gameplay
data, the equipment that players were wearing, the frequency of those impacts, the
speeds that the players we're traveling, the angles that they hit one another and
such. And some of that work, which has been very laborious over the last couple ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-05

Q - Jeﬀ Miller
A - Matt Woodyears looking at upwards of 700 or 800 concussions on ﬁeld, allowed us -- some of
us who are looking at this to identify trends in the data and to do so manually.
And Jeﬀ, if you want to just spend 30 seconds talking about some of the outcomes
of that real quickly.
{BIO 1773143 <GO>}
Sure. I think Jeﬀ mentioned we can identify trends and opportunities. And so while
the road map was sort of a long-term plan, what we said is are there sort of oﬀ ramps
that we can implement right now and make changes to the game. So one of them
would be, I think, an educational opportunity where we tested helmets on an annual
basis. And we saw some that performed better than others. They were our top-
performing group. And I think what we were able to do is, through an educational
program with the players and teams understanding what we had for on-ﬁeld data,
we were able to take the players that were 41% in top-performing helmets in 2017
and moved to 99% of players in top-performing helmets this year.
Another example might be a rule change that we worked on. Historically, if you look,
the kickoﬀ returns has some of the highest injury rates. So what we did is we looked
at video. We looked at Next Gen Stats. We did something called a clustering analysis,
where we said, "What is it on kickoﬀs that makes that such a dangerous play?" We
shared that with special teams coaches. We shared that with the Competition
Committee. And what they were able to do was come up with the rules to change
that play, such that they could keep all the excitement but remove those riskiest
scenarios. I think Jeﬀ mentioned the tedious nature. We've looked at over 100,000
helmet impacts manually. And so one of the challenges now is how do we scale that.
How do we accelerate? I think that's one of the reasons why we're so excited about
the AWS partnership. How do we leverage their suite of tools? How do we leverage
what they're doing in AI and machine learning to help us drive innovation at a faster
pace more eﬃciently and more broadly?
{BIO 22261500 <GO>}
So Matt, let's turn to you. I think we can all agree that looking at 100,000 head
impacts on ﬁlm is a little bit crazy. And then probably suggest that anybody who is
doing it, that there has to be a better way.
{BIO 18000850 <GO>}
Quickly overwhelming.
{BIO 22261500 <GO>}
Quickly overwhelming. Let's talk to you about -- from your approach, what do you
see when you hear about the data and the work that we've done so far and what the
possibilities are?
{BIO 18000850 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-05
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 10 of 13Q - Jeﬀ Miller
Q - Jeﬀ CrandallSure. I mean, I think, ﬁrst and foremost, the thing that I've been impressed most with
from our partnership so far and the material work that we've done so far is just the
level of drive and innovation inside the NFL. Working on these biomechanical
models, a willingness to explore and wonder through this kind of exploratory world
together, I think we've done some great work. And we'll continue to do more going
forward.
From a machine learning perspective, machine learning, it all starts with the data.
And the data of the NFL is generating the ground truth data that we've already got
access to, the video troves. All of this information, it's just -- it's a raw material from
which we can just continue to extract meaning insight into the game like we've been
doing with Next Gen Stats. And then start to take that even further, as we start to
integrate and move towards improving player health and safety.
And so whilst it's tempting to focus on machine learning, machine learning is just the
frosting on the top. It's the 20%. And the 80% is all about the data. It's how you store
it. And so one of the ﬁrst things we've been working on is creating a data lake, which
puts all of that data together in a single place, which is -- has the right access
controls and right governance and is available to the sort of computation, which
allows you to explore it.
Then you can get into machine learning. And if you're doing it wrong, machine
learning is -- it's like driving around with your lights oﬀ at night without a map. It's --
you just -- you can go anywhere that you want. And you can explore. But you can
often take a wrong turn. And you can end up in a dead end. And what we've been
trying to do with services like SageMaker, particularly the new announcements that
we've made this week with things like SageMaker Studio and our debugging and
proﬁling capabilities, model monitoring and autopilot that allows you to create
models automatically, we're giving the NFL the map. And we're turning on the lights
to our car. And that means that we can look around corners. And as a group, with
AWS and our machine learning solutions lab and the experts in the NFL, we can start
to plot a course towards a safer game. And we're going to do that with the data that
we've collected. We're going to do it using the computer vision models and the
predictive models that we're going to build with SageMaker.
{BIO 22261500 <GO>}
Jeﬀ, one of the endpoints of the map that Matt was talking about that we've
conceived of is the Digital Athlete platform, which the previous panel talked about
brieﬂy. And the opportunities that, that provides in ways that I don't think have
existed before to better understand how humans perform and behave. And
potentially how to avoid injuries or ﬁnd other trends in data based on that platform
that we could potentially build together during the course of this partnership. Can
you give your perspective on that for a minute?
{BIO 1773143 <GO>}
Sure. I think if you look, the NFL provides a sort of unique opportunity to look at
human motion, forces and injury among a population of the world's most elite
athletes. And so our challenge is how do we protect those athletes. And so thisFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-05

A - Matt Wood
Q - Jeﬀ Millerconcept of a Digital Athlete that you've heard, the basic idea is that we will take a
virtual representation of this population of athletes. And we will be able to simulate
potential changes to the game across a wide spectrum of scenarios, both that we
currently envision and those that come up in the future. This will heavily rely on the
tools that Dr. Wood just mentioned, machine learning, computer vision, AI. And
ultimately, what we'll be able to do is we'll be able to identify injury risk scenarios.
We'll be able to predict injury risk scenarios. And we'll be able to ﬁnd innovations
that will make the game safer for our athletes while maintaining the high-quality of
play within the game. And so I think it's not really an overstatement to say that we
believe this will revolutionize the way in which we do injury prevention, player
rehabilitation and play a recovery in the NFL.
{BIO 22261500 <GO>}
And Matt, we, obviously, focus myopically sometimes on football. Your job is to take
a much broader look over at the horizon and about how tools like this that could be
developed together could have applications.
{BIO 18000850 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 22261500 <GO>}
What do you think about when you conceive of the Digital Athlete?
{BIO 18000850 <GO>}
Sure. I mean, it is hard to overstate the potential of a digital twin when you're
applying that to people. Exactly as we're doing with the Digital Athlete, the
opportunity to create and simulate and then ask what if in diﬀerent situations without
putting real humans at risk and being able to do that hundreds of millions of times
and get accurate results from it, it's an incredibly inventive, a broadly applicable
technology. And I'm so excited that we get to build it together. It has opportunities
across things like workplace safety. It has opportunity like architecture and building
design, defense. But perhaps the one I'm most interested in is applying it more
broadly to just health care. Once we have biomechanical information, which can be
combined with health care information, you can start to do just wonderful things and
start to develop more and more precise models for treatment of all matter -- all
manner of diseases.
The general trend of medicine moving from a broad collection where you treat
patients in groups and segments to a position where you can treat individuals with
very, very precise treatments, it leads some far better outcomes for the patients. And
it is materially more eﬃcient for a health care system. So if you are looking to
improve the eﬃciency of health care and provide healthier people, this is a fantastic
technology.

innovative companies ever to partner with them, to talk about the Digital Athlete and
Digital Athlete platform and all that, that portends over the next few years.
Jeﬀ, as we think about this journey and what comes next, looking around corners,
what else could we potentially be talking about a couple of years from now, if we -- if
AWS bothered to invite us back to re:Invent for an encore performance?

You're welcome back, by the way. Invitation is open.

I think the ﬁrst thing we need to do is let those video reviewers out of their dark
rooms that have watched 100,000 impacts.
{BIO 22261500 <GO>}
That's true. That's true.
{BIO 1773143 <GO>}
But I think, if you look at it, I mean, we realize our limitations right now. We
mentioned the amount of data that's available to the NFL. And I think we're
struggling to look at this number of databases and number of resources. And what
we do is the way we do it now is we come up with hypothesis. And we hypothesis
test. But we realize our limitation. So what we're really looking forward to is with the
Digital Athlete platform, identifying patterns, identifying trends, identifying
opportunities that we're not even aware of now. What's the unknown? So I think
we're very excited to embark on that.
{BIO 18000850 <GO>}
Absolutely. Yes. That exploration is going to be a long-term partnership. That
exploration and doing it quickly is going to be disproportionately important. It's a
very exciting to do it with you.
{BIO 22261500 <GO>}
Well as we wrap up this discussion, let me thank everybody for being here and
listening to us.
As you can tell, we're incredibly excited about the journey that we're going to start
here with AWS. As I mentioned, if we're invited back, we will welcome that
opportunity and give everybody a marker along the way, as we try to create things
that haven't been created yet for the betterment of football and beyond that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-05

Page 13 of 13And one thing that we've pledged to do with the NFL is be incredibly transparent, as
we've gone down this journey around improving the health and safety of our sport in
doing so with world-class partners like AWS. So it is our responsibility to continue to
do that. And we will.
