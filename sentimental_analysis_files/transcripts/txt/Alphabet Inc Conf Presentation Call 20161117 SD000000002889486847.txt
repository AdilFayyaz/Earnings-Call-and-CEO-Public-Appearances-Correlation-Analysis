From travel search, to ads, to gas, hotel booking, these giant forays into travel have
made the power to stoke more industry speculation and trepidation than any other.
Please welcome Google's Vice President of Travel, Oliver Heckmann.
Hi. everybody. I'm here to talk about what Google is doing in 2016. But to set the
stage let's ﬁrst watch a quick video.
video playing [ph]
Users are on their smartphone all the time, whether they are experiencing those
short moments, whether it's the ones that you just saw in the video, or mundane
ones, for example, when you are queuing in the supermarket, or during a
commercial break on TV, or at home, at dinner, at least when my wife is not watching,
or even so nobody admits that when people take a bathroom break. So keep this in
mind. I want to give you now a preview of what we are doing for 2016.
Let's start just by looking at some actual user behavior. We did a research study with
a third-party research agency and an opted-in panel of users who shared their
complete Internet behavior with us for the purposes of that study. And in the two-
month study, we observed almost 40,000 digital moments like searching, people
looking at websites, consuming online video or using apps. What's remarkable is
that 87% of those digital moments were actually happening on a mobile device.
Let's zoom in and look at one of the users, Amy, here. We analyzed her moments in a
bit more detail. You see some recurring pattern around dating and you see theseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-17

Page 2 of 12short. But intense bursts of activity before Black Friday and before purchasing an
HDTV. What's interesting for us here in this room is looking at her travel behavior and
Amy was actually researching a trip to Disney World. And what's very remarkable
here is that this is very clearly a high consideration activity for her. She had actually
started researching this trip before the study began and two months of study, 419
diﬀerent digital moments of her trying to plan this trip and she was not ﬁnished by
the time the study ended two months later. And the behavior that we are seeing here
with Amy is a behavior that we see generally happen across the whole Internet.
We just publicly released numbers last month. In October, Google's mobile search
traﬃc across everything globally has surpassed the amount of search traﬃc that we
are seeing on desktop. And if we zoom in and look only at the travel-speciﬁc queries
on Google, we see a similar pattern. It is still continuing to grow massively fast on
mobile with a more than 50% growth of mobile queries on Google in the travel
space in the last year.
At the same time as the number of sessions increased, they actually become shorter
and shorter. That's why we call them moments. And users are willing to convert on
mobile. We have seen an almost doubling of mobile conversion rates in the travel
space in the last year. The conversion needs to be frictionless enough for a user to
convert on mobile. So what we are seeing is there are more queries and more visits
happening on mobile. But they are shorter and users are willing to convert.
So our conclusion is travel planning is increasingly happening on mobile. But it's
fractured and split across many more sessions. But shorter ones in diﬀerent points in
time. And we have been saying that for actually quite a long time now at Google. In
this new world of mobile traﬃc and fractured moments, just providing (inaudible)
links no longer is going to cut it for our users. Google is becoming a powerful
assistant for our users. We have to provide answers to our users at the moment they
need them. We need to provide them with the data that they are looking for and
then send them to the right partner for the user to convert. And this is the path that
we are on and we've made some great progress on that this year. So I am going to
talk about that next, give a quick update on ﬂights and hotels. And then I'm going to
show you a new product that we have been developing this year.
So let's have a look at Google Flights. First of all, I have to say I love Google Flights.
It's an awesome product and I'm not alone in that opinion. We are increasingly
getting very, very positive feedback, whether it's from the press or our partners and
of course, from our users and even Steve Hafner yesterday mentioned how it is
kicking ass. So we are very proud of the product.
What we did this year on Google Flights is we launched a new more beautiful and
even faster seamlessly integrated experience in search and we've made a lot of
improvements behind the scenes in the back end and we've launched new partners.
Furthermore -- and that's for someone coming from Europe, I'm proud of that
feature -- we are now also showing you, in the Google Flights search results, trains, at
least in those countries where taking a train is a viable alternative to jumping on a
plane. And that is saving the user an extra query to ﬁnd a train connection.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-17
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 3 of 12And this is along the same lines of one of the other features that our users love
about the product and it's the Tips feature. We've done a lot of improvements in the
last year on the Tips feature. What we are doing for Tips in Google Flights search, as
the user is searching for a connection, we actually proactively run a number of
searches in the background. We check nearby dates automatically. We check
alternative airports. We check for you immediately whether an upgrade into business
or ﬁrst class would be quite cheap and if we ﬁnd anything interesting for you, we
proactively show that to the user, saving the user having to do a number of searches
looking at the alternative space or looking up some complicated information in a big
table, which is not very convenient to do, especially on a mobile phone.
Traﬃc keeps massively increasing and we are pretty proud of the fact that we have
managed to send three times the number of referrals, the number of clicks to our
partners in this space. And along similar lines, our hotel product has been continuing
to grow. More and more users are using hotel search on Google and, as a result of
that, more and more users are seeing the hotel ads that we embed in hotel search.
Similarly as for Flights, we've launched a new beautiful experience that's seamlessly
integrated into search and that's making very useful use of Google Maps. Right now,
we are working on a number of other features, among them increasing the number
of reviews [ph] that are available for hotels. Furthermore, we've grown the number of
partners that are using hotel search and we've been talking to many of you partners
and we have been listening to your feedback. One of the most requested features in
the hotel space has been an alternative pricing model for hotel ads. Traditionally, we
run hotel ads using the normal search ad pricing model of CPC. But that's not how
many people in the Street are thinking. So we've launched this year for qualiﬁed
partners a new commission pricing model that can be used as an alternative to CPC.
We've almost quadrupled the number of links, the number of clicks that we are
sending to our partners and it's key to our continued success in this space that we
are building products that are proﬁtable for our partners. And one of our partners is
La Quinta. And as you can see from this quote from Ted, the traﬃc that we are
sending with hotel ads to La Quinta his converting at twice the rate than their other
mobile traﬃc. We've been working with La Quinta for quite a while now on helping
them through the shift of user behavior to mobile and it is clearly paying oﬀ.
This year, you will probably also have seen us talk more about Google Book -- Book
on Google for ﬂights and hotels and I know that some of you are asking themselves
is Google slowly becoming an OTA. And as the person who is responsible for the
product strategy of Google in travel, I can tell you this is not the case. We are not
becoming an OTA.
As you have seen earlier, we are closely analyzing user behavior and in this new
world of mobile and short fractured moments, every piece of friction in the
transaction process is costing people transactions. So we are actually, with Book on
Google, collaborating with our partners to make this conversion process as smooth
as possible with the goal of driving conversion rates up.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-17
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 12It works the following way. A user searches for a ﬂight or a hotel on Google and
when he has selected his ﬂight, instead of sending the user oﬀ to a third-party
website, we are actually sending the user to a page that is hosted by Google. So it's
in the Google domain. But it is partner-branded. It will say purchase this ﬂight from
Lufthansa. For many users, this is very convenient because we are in the Google
domain. You are probably already locked into your Google account because you just
searched on Google and we can access the address information that the user has
and the credit card information they might have on ﬁle because they are regularly
making purchases in the place, or for other reasons. And so it's much as likely that
the user has to go through a sign-up or login or even worse, password recovery
process on a third-party website.
Behind the scenes what we are doing is we are passing on the user information and
the credit card information via APIs directly to our partner and the partner is the
merchant of record. The partner owns the customer relationship and the partner is
the one who is sending their own conﬁrmation email to the user and who are then
directly also handling all follow-up questions, post-booking questions and so on. So
the partner is in full ownership of the traveler relationship.
This is an optional feature. It's available both for ﬂights and for hotels. It helps
converting users, especially in these short moments, on mobile. I should also
mention that Book on Google for hotels is not coupled to using commission pricing.
These are two independent features. You can use one, you can use both, or you can
use none of them. We have been seeing great success here and as a result, with a
number of partners both on ﬂights and hotels and as a result of that success, you
might have seen Lufthansa's press announcement from two weeks ago. Lufthansa is
now working with us with Book on Google. We've done this integration with them
leveraging the fantastic services oﬀered by peakwork and we are looking forward to
integrating many more partners in the ﬂights and hotel space.
So now I announced earlier that I am going to show you a new product. Let me set
the stage for that ﬁrst. So as you all know, travel planning is so much more than just
ﬁnding a ﬂight or a hotel. It's a long process as we have seen. It can take multiple
months. It can be quite cumbersome and we see that especially early on in the travel
process, many of our users have a lot of ﬂexibility around the destination. But also
around the diﬀerent dates that they could travel. Our goal with this product that you
are going to see in a second is to make the logistics of planning simpler so that
people can spend more time in the early phases dreaming about the destination.
So let me invite Derek Coatney, Google Product Manager, to the stage. He is
bringing his phone because we are doing a live demo. We launched this product
that you are going to see ﬁrst in October this year. So it is fresh out and it's available
in English only right now. And let's have a look.
So since my wife and I moved to the US a few months ago, my wife keeps
mentioning that she is missing Europe. So I'm thinking maybe I should just, as a gift,
invite her to a trip to Europe. So let's explore Europe vacations on Google search.
First thing is -- that's the risk of a live demo. Also shows that it's hard to type on aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-17
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 12mobile phone. Let's switch to the slides. That's the risk when you are doing a live
demo. So you might actually want to follow the demo on your own phone. The idea
is you search for Europe vacations and you see the new destination experience that
looks like this in Google search. You have to search in English for now to see this.
Sorry for the hiccup.
So I'm exploring Europe vacations in Google search, getting this and the ﬁrst thing I
do is I -- my wife is an architect. So to have a successful vacation, I want to look at
sites, at destinations that are known for their architecture. That's a pretty easy bet to
win with my wife. So let's do that. Florence intrigues me. Let me have a closer look at
that. I can use beautiful imagery to get a feeling for the place. I can read through
editorial descriptions to understand this a bit better. I can browse and swipe through
the top sites in Florence to get a bit of a feeling what we would be ending up doing
there. I get quick logistical information informing me about the expected costs of
traveling there. I can see where Florence actually is in Italy, important for people
from the US. And I'm getting weather information for example to see whether
weather is actually going to be good enough early next year.
There is also something that you see that's the popularity data there. What we've
done here is we've actually analyzed real user behavior, real traveler behavior,
leveraging Google location history and we are computing a signal of how popular is
this destination through the course of the year.
Furthermore, we want people to dream about the destination, get a feeling for it so
the beautiful images -- beautiful videos here that you can watch in line [ph]. And
actually if you are doing this later on your phone, this video here, the New York
Times video, is really amazing. Anyhow, at the bottom, I can click through and
explore other similar destinations and continue dreaming about the diﬀerent Europe
destinations that we want to go through. So this is live on Google even though it just
didn't work on our phone. This is live on Google. We just launched this fresh about a
month ago.
What we are going to do next is we are going to show you where we are taking this
product. So you are seeing a preview of this now. So this is a demo; this is not live.
The ﬁrst thing you notice is that we have added, or we will be adding price
information to this product. You will be seeing ﬂight and hotel prices here. We are
also recommending you a time period where it is particularly cheap to travel to this
destination and that's because many people are actually ﬂexible with their dates.
When I talk about prices here, it's important to clarify we are actually exposing fresh
and bookable prices here. So we are using, actually at the time the user is querying,
we are looking at all the actually available ﬂights and hotels using the Google speed
and accuracy. And this allows us to build some really powerful ﬁlters that support the
ﬂexibility that we see that people typically have if they are leisure travelers in the
early phases of their travel planning.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-17
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 12So let's assume I want to go on that trip with my wife and I want to go sometime in
January. Like many people, I'm actually pretty ﬂexible on when to take that week of
vacation oﬀ. Traditionally, I would have to do a lot of diﬀerent searches throughout
the diﬀerent possible one-week intervals in January where I could actually go and
that's a lot of work and bad user experience, even more so if you are trying to do
that from your mobile phone.
So what we do instead is the following. We actually look through all the Europe
destinations and for each destination, we look up all the sliding window of seven
days -- if I want to travel for seven days -- of date combinations in January and for
each of those combinations, we look up actually what's a cheap ﬂight and a hotel
available for that date. We do that for all the destinations; we add this up in each
destination. We ﬁgure out what's the best, meaning the cheapest, week to go to that
destination. We expose that. We rank all the destinations and we do all of that at sub-
second speed. So here you are seeing that and you will actually notice that we are
recommending if you go to Barcelona a diﬀerent week than Munich in this case.
So as many travelers, I'm a bit budget-constrained. So I want to go with my wife. So
it's two of us and let's not spend more than $2,500 and you see immediately the
results are updating. Munich dropped out; it's too expensive to go there. What I can
do now is I can look at Barcelona, Dublin and so on using the same experience that
we showed you earlier and inform myself about those destinations. Let's just assume
I'm doing that and I settle down on Barcelona. Looks interesting. The weather in
Spain in January is good enough for this to be a worthwhile trip. I want to get a bit of
a better feeling how does such a trip to Barcelona look like.
I can do that with the Plan a Trip feature that we are launching and if you go there,
the ﬁrst thing you'll notice is the price graph that we are showing. That's showing you
the actually available ﬂights and hotel prices that we've pre-computed for you in
lightning speed using all the diﬀerent date combinations in January reaching into
February. So that gives you a good trade-oﬀ for traveling earlier or later, how much
more expensive or cheaper that's going to be.
I can also now explore a couple of options. Let's say this is a present for my wife. So
maybe we should use a nonstop ﬂight. Let's do that and a good hotel is probably a
good idea too. So let's do four stars or better. And you see immediately all the
results are updating and we've looked at four-star hotels that are actually still
available to book across all the dates that we are looking at.
Let's also explore, if we would stay a bit longer, how much more expensive that's
going to be. Let's look at extending the stay to 10 days. And again, you see the
information is updating superfast. If I'm scrolling further down, I get more detailed
information about the ﬂights and hotels. We are actually pulling the cheapest and,
using our algorithms, the best ﬂight for you. In this example, because we are
traveling from here to Barcelona, there is only one nonstop ﬂight, thus we only see
one nonstop ﬂight. If we are clicking through, we can seamlessly move over into
Google Flight search and in Flight search leverage the full power of this awesomeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-17

is similar.
So you have seen a preview, an early preview of a new destination experience that
we have built in Google that is optimized for those short mobile moments where
people are snacking for destination content. We are summarizing logistical
information for them and we are especially powerful in helping people explore when
they are ﬂexible in the destination that they went to go to or/and when they are
ﬂexible in the exact date that they could travel to the destination.
That gets me to the end of my talk. I want to wrap up. Our goal here at Google is to
work with you, the travel industry, on providing solutions that connect our users with
exactly what they are looking for in these short micro moments. And in many cases
this is connecting them to the products and services that you built and the more
delightful and the more useful we can make the travel experience for the users, the
more we all win in the long run. Thank you for your attention.
Thank you, Oliver. Let's get our talk-backers up on stage -- Rod Cuthbert, Rome2rio
and Elizabeth Harz, ADARA.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 17292189 <GO>}
Oliver. Good morning. You talked a bit about pulling together all of these disparate
assets that Google has to delight the consumer and in moments leveraging the
diﬀerent tools from hotels to ﬂights to Zagat. Can you talk a bit about the
monetization strategy? You touched on the commission model on the hotel front. But
as you pull all of these together, talk a little bit about how you work with the
conﬂicting interest sometimes between the media model and more of a commission
channel model?
So with the new product, the new destination experience that we showed, this is an
early product for us still. So we are still ﬂexible on the exact monetization model for
that product. We tend to focus on the user ﬁrst and worry about monetization
second. But it is including ﬂights and hotels and it's actually leveraging the products
that we have for ﬂights and hotels. So our existing monetization models for ﬂights
and hotels continue to work. But I think it's also obvious if you watch closely that
there are new opportunities coming from that product, for example, in the package
space. These are early thoughts for us. We want to ﬁrst get this right for the user and
then worry about the monetization. But I think there are exciting opportunities.

A - Elizabeth Harz
A - Oliver HeckmannI imagine with your YouTube and shopping experience coming over to the travel
vertical, pulling all these assets together is a big ambition of yours. Can you talk a
little bit more about that? Today was a little peek into where you are headed. But
there are many assets that you didn't lean into as much in that demo.
Yes. So I only mentioned a subset of the things that we are doing given there was
limited time and I wanted to have enough time to show you the demo and, as
Elizabeth mentioned, I've been moving over to the travel space a year ago and I was
working on YouTube before -- something I generally feel, by the way, that we are not
fully leveraging -- you guys are not fully leveraging in the travel industry is actually
the insane power that YouTube has. The amount of content that is there is actually
mind-boggling. Every single hotel that I have stayed since I've moved over and work
on travel has actually multiple YouTube videos available and there are surprisingly
few ads for hotels shown in the context of these videos. So there are clear
opportunities there.
{BIO 17292189 <GO>}
So as a consumer, I certainly see how my United ﬂight data goes from Google Mail to
my calendar and I would just love to get Google's perspective on data strategy -- the
collection, ownership, privacy. Many of those questions come up when you
experience that kind of data movement.
Yes, privacy is actually a topic that's important for us and as you know or might not
know, there is something that's called the Google Dashboard that is creating
transparency over the data that we have and the diﬀerent services that Google has to
the user. And it's using pretty clear language and it's giving the user full control and
ownership of the data. And we feel that that's an important thing to do and as the
user is in control and ownership of the data, he is more willing to have that data be
used for us to create some delightful experiences. If the user is not opting out of
those services, what we can do is we can, from the email receipt in his inbox, for
example, that's a new version of Gmail, we can show you your travel information
more structured so you don't have to -- you are landing in Paris; you are on roaming;
you need to ﬁnd your hotel and then the faster we can actually get you to that
information, the more delightful and the less stressful your travel experience is going
to be.
{BIO 17292189 <GO>}
But as you can imagine, from the supplier side and your partner side, there are some
issues that are raised around that. Just thoughts for those in the audience that may
think of that more as their data and how that is used on the platform?
Yes. What we are doing and I showed this earlier when we said Book on Google,
what we want to do here is we might actually share the user information with the
supplier so that the supplier has the full information they would get if that userFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-17

A - Oliver Heckmannwould go directly to their page. The goal here is really to decrease the friction and
oﬀer -- the user will have less friction in the actual purchase process. But he will have
the same experience because I'm buying the ticket from Lufthansa and Lufthansa has
my email address and I'm getting the same email from Lufthansa that I would be
getting if I would go to their page, create an account there, sign up manually on my
mobile phone, enter all my address information and so on. That would be more
friction. But it will lead to the same outcome.
{BIO 17292189 <GO>}
I have more questions but, Rod, you can't be quiet this long; you are going to --.
{BIO 4102280 <GO>}
Right. You mustn't hog the ﬂoor. I've been waiting for a long time to get on the
couch with you, Oliver. I feel, on behalf of at least a portion of the industry, that we
need to talk about our relationship. I think a lot of us felt that we were in a
committed, exclusive relationship and now with the stuﬀ that you've been doing with
ﬂights and hotels and what we saw today, man, it looks like you are playing the ﬁeld.
I guess a lot of us are thinking how is this relationship going to play out now. Are you
going to be the sort of partner -- because we felt we had this great partnership -- are
you going to be the sort of partner that is committed to making it work and is open
and wants to talk about it and ﬁnd a way to make it work?
That's why I'm here, yes.
{BIO 17292189 <GO>}
Don't interrupt your partner.
{BIO 4102280 <GO>}
Okay, that sounds good. Because we wouldn't want you to be the sort of partner that
just said, well, that's how it is; deal with it. As Douglas so succinctly put it yesterday in
his intro, he said maybe Google is biting the hand that feeds it. Is that a discussion
that you have inside Google?
First, generally, biting the hand that feeds you is not a good business strategy. And
that's not what we are doing. Very clear we are not becoming an OTA. Google has
actually been in the travel space since the beginning of Google. From the ﬁrst day
that we launched, users came to Google and asked us questions around traveling.
And it's not just ﬂights and hotels. They have all kinds of questions that actually only
Google and other search engines are answering them. Are there poisonous animals
on Hawaii? Until which months can my pregnant wife still ﬂy?? Are there good
hospitals close by? Where can I buy camping equipment after I land in Honolulu? Do
I need a visa for entering Russia with a German passport? There are all kinds of
questions. (inaudible) travel planning just means looking up a ﬂight and a hotel and
clicking on the book links.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-17

That's all well and good. But the industry that you see here before you and I think
Phocuswright really demonstrates what a considerable industry it is and a lot of fun
too, the Amadeus party last night, I just want to say well done to the Amadeus team.
Actually, on that topic, let me add something. I have worked on YouTube for almost
nine years. I've been the creator person there so I've been working with the music
industry, with Hollywood and with all the YouTube stars. So I have seen a lot of crazy
parties in my past nine years. But I have to say you guys beat the music industry in
partying and I didn't expect that.
{BIO 17292189 <GO>}
Oliver, we have a question from the audience. (multiple speakers).
{BIO 4102280 <GO>}
What I wanted to say was, it's all very well that you've been answering all those
questions. But the industry that you see here before you, a large part of it was built
by intermediaries, people like Expedia and Booking.com and TripAdvisor and Viator
and Rome2rio and all sorts of other people. They are here today. They have spent an
enormous amount of money with you and when we look at the things you are doing,
we wonder about our place in your view of the future. It doesn't seem as though we
have a place. We see you thinking about you and the consumer and we wonder
where we are in that. And it's like a lot of people in the industry see Google as an
existential threat, a clear-and-present danger to their business.
Yes. We are partnering with all of you. The world is changing and that was the
common theme across most of the talks yesterday and the day before. The travel
industry -- but the same is true for the broader industry that Google is in -- is in a
constant state of change and there is a constant amount of disruption going on. Like
a few years ago, who would've thought that Uber would disrupt the transportation
business or Airbnb would disrupt the hotel business the way that they have done it.
So actually probably the next disruption is someone sitting on that side of the stage.
And for Google as the broader search business that we are in as a tech company, we
are living in a world that has these kind of similar disruptions that are aﬀecting us on
a day-to-day basis. And user behavior today is diﬀerent. People have moved to
shorter and shorter moments. They are on their mobile phone all the time. They have
diﬀerent expectations on what we need to provide them and if we at Google don't
move and provide them the answers as quickly as possible as they are looking for it,
then they will stop using Google and they will be using something else. (multiple

Page 11 of 12A - Oliver Heckmann
A - Unidentiﬁed SpeakerI'm Travis Katz from a company called Gogobot and I wanted to talk about the user.
So one of the founding principles of Google is put the user ﬁrst and all else will
follow and you talked about your goal with travel is to provide users with exactly
what they are looking for in the answers. But one of the core tenets of our economic
system is what users really want is choice and what's happening with Google is we
are seeing what you're doing is the travel product, which is beautiful by the way --
congratulations on all your work -- you are not giving users anymore choice of where
they get those answers from and a lot of people think that you are abusing your
monopoly in search to drive your things [ph].
So my question for you is, if the product is so good and if you really are providing
users the answers that they are looking for, why are you forcing your results to go
ﬁrst in the search results as opposed to letting the core Google algorithm rank them
against other competitive sites?
We are not putting -- I'm not sure if you meant the hotel or the ﬂight product or both
of them. We are not putting anything up -- the ranking of our services in Google
search is strictly following what's good for the user and we measure all kind of
metrics for that. So we are not putting for example the hotel search results ﬁrst if we
are not actually scientiﬁcally proving using all kind of metrics that that's the best
thing for the user looking at short clicks, long clicks and all kind of other stuﬀ, side-
by-side comparisons, panels, retention and all kind of other metrics.
The product is much better. The world has changed. If I am searching for a hotel, to
stick with that example, 10 blue links are no longer going to cut it. And now uses are
also not searching for hotels in New York or in Florida, in Miami. The user is not
looking for another place where he can search for hotels. The user is trying to ﬁnd
hotels in Miami and our experience is showing you directly much better than 10 blue
links where are on the map are the diﬀerent hotels; what are the prices? This is fresh
