Good morning. I'm Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. It's my privilege and
pleasure to welcome you today to the Walmart presentation here, our 39th Annual
Institutional Investors Conference here in Orlando. With us today from Walmart,
we've got Brett Biggs, EVP and CFO; Steve Schmitt, Vice President of IR and soon to
be CFO of Walmart -- of Sam's Club. Also with us from the company, we've got
Stefano Rosso, CFO of Chile; Kary Brunner from the IR team; and Melanie Belford,
who's with Sam's Club in Finance. Brett, without further ado, I'm going to let you start
and then we'll get the presentation.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Budd. Appreciate you having me here in the ﬁrst (inaudible) March
(inaudible) and everybody will agree with that as well. So thanks for having us. This is
always one of the best conferences, we really appreciate you having us here. I'm
going to start this morning -- we always start with this slide, which is our (inaudible)
to make sure that we let you know that I may make forward-looking statements this
morning. So please review all the materials we have on our website for (inaudible).
This is a slide I'd like to start with. And if I think about us on a stage, this is us on a
stage. And everything that we do and everything we talk about goes from -- so as
you think about us as a company, this is how we think about ourselves. It starts with
who we are, what's our DNA, who we are as a company, taking care of associates,
taking care of our customers -- everything we do, doing the best we can, striving to
be excellent -- thank you for getting the volume adjusted. And the bottom, it's why
we do what we do. Who do we do this for? So it's for customers, for our associates,
for our communities and, more importantly, for our shareholders and our investors
that have been great investors for our company. And in the middle, what is it that we
do and how we do it? So you've heard Doug talk a lot about making every day easier
for busy families. And as we talk about an executive team, decisions that we make,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-06
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 2 of 10that's where we start, how do we make lives easier for our customers. And I'll go
through a few things that we're doing in that regard.
We're continuing to change how this company works. We're becoming a much more
digital company, using technology more than we ever have, both on the customer
side as well as on the back side. I like the discipline that we have today. I'll talk a little
bit more about it. We've always been a fairly disciplined company but we're getting
better and better from that standpoint. It's going to continue to fuel the business and
our ability to grow long term. Then we want to be the most trusted retailer. This is
very important for us from a community standpoint, from an investor standpoint and
with our customers as well.
Here we go. It's a little bit of a slow feed on the slide change. As we make decisions
as a company, the ﬁnancial framework is really important. We laid this out a little over
a year ago for investors to help you think about how you should think about us as a
company. We've always talked about -- we started with growth, which is really
important for us as a company. And strong growth but we added the word eﬃcient.
And I'll talk in a minute how we are growing in a more eﬃcient way than we were in
the past. So we're growing sales more on comp and with e-commerce versus
building new stores. And you'll see that in the graph that I'll show in just a minute.
From a discipline standpoint, I said I like where we're going from a cost standpoint.
I'll talk about that a little more in a minute. Working capital has been a huge
improvement over the last couple of years for the company and it's fueling our
ability to grow more eﬃciently. And as we spend capital, we want to spend every
dollar strategically in the right way and putting that against the things that are most
important for our company, as you would have expect.
There we go. So start the year, we're coming in with really good momentum. We had
a nice year in FY '18, made good progress overall, a lot of progress on a number of
fronts and the momentum's good coming into the year. For the ﬁrst time this year,
revenue surpassed in FY '18 $500 billion. So we're starting to become a pretty big
company, which is helpful. You're able to do a lot of good things as you become a
big company. From a comp standpoint, U.S. comps at 2.1%. If you see on the right,
the Walmart U.S. comps, really progressing as we went throughout the year, a 2.6%
comp in the Fourth Quarter. Some of it's e-commerce, some of that's in stores. But
we like that number. It's a really important number. And also, the traﬃc increases that
you're seeing are really important. So a 1.6% traﬃc increase in the Fourth Quarter.
U.S. e-commerce sales are 44%. I'll talk about that a bit more in a minute. Our comp,
as you know, was lower in the Fourth Quarter and I'll speak to that a bit. Sam's Club
continues to have really good momentum. Actually, we have our year beginning
meeting right now here in Orlando, where all our team is together and good
momentum at Sam's Club. I like what John and team are doing there.
International continues to be a good story. Ten of 11 markets with positive comps. We
have our CFO from Chile here. Chile had a great year this last year. EPS increased
2.3%. If you pull out all the adjustments that we had in the last year -- in last year and
the year before that, we did leverage expenses for the year and we leveraged moreFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-06
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 10in the last half of the year as we did in the ﬁrst half of the year. So I like the progress
we're making on expenses. And I never want to go away without talking about that
operating cash ﬂow number of $28.3 billion this last year. And so if you look at the
last two years, almost $60 billion of operating cash ﬂow. And as a company, it just
gives us a ton of options about how we win long term.
So let's go through each one of the things in the ﬁnancial framework and I talk ﬁrst
about strong, eﬃcient growth. And from a total sales perspective, if you look at FY
'18, way more than half of our growth is coming from comps and e-commerce
growth. If you have had gone back 2 or three years ago, you would've seen much
more than half of our sales coming from new store growth. So this allows us to be
much more eﬃcient as a company going forward from a return and an expense
standpoint. So we're really proud of the progress we've made with this.
From an operating discipline standpoint, we've talked about a number of times on
the left, SG&A as a % of sales is not where we want it to be. We've made intentional
investments in e-commerce and wages and other things that have taken our SG&A
from 19% to 21%. And these are reported numbers that you see here on the left. But
we started to bend the curve in this last year and it's what we said we wanted to do
and we've been able to start bending that curve and you can see we expect that to
continue. So we've made good progress, particularly in Walmart U.S. stores and in
international from a leverage perspective when we leverage for the year. Walmart's
never lost its EDLC culture but it hasn't been as intense as it has been in the past.
And if you're in the company now versus a year ago, you would feel that intensity
again versus EDLC. And so I really am proud of what we're doing. And we're making
progress on things like goods not for resale, shared services and places where, with
our scale, we can make a big impact as we go forward.
Now we did take some of that, as you would have seen. And we made some
conscious decisions to invest further in FY '19. And that's going to oﬀset some of the
savings that you would've seen from a leverage standpoint.
As tax reform started developing at the end of last year, we stepped back to the
team and said, are there things that we think we should do to accelerate
investments, some initiatives that we had underway, pricing, wages, technology, e-
commerce, supply chain? And we decided, yes, this was an opportunity for us to go
ahead and continue to accelerate some initiatives and continue to put our foot down
on the pedal as it relates to our aggressiveness as we continue to compete and want
to win longer term. And so you would've seen the associate investment that we
announced in January. We're going to continue to be thoughtful but aggressive from
a pricing standpoint. That's a big part of our DNA and we're going to continue to win
from a price standpoint. And we're going to continue to invest in the future whether
it's technology, e-commerce. There are so many things going on now in supply chain
that we're going to take advantage of technology and what we can do there as well.
But we are going to focus on investing to win in the long term. We understand short-
term and long-term expectations for shareholders. But we want to win long term.
And as we've been giving guidance over the last year or 2, we've said there may beFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-06
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 10periods of time where we decide to invest. And this is a period of time where we
said we want to invest further in our business.
So from a capital allocation standpoint, obviously, we get a lot of questions. You have
a lot of interest in how we allocate capital. Nothing has changed in how we think
about capital. So we start with we want to invest in the business. And so we start in
that upper right-hand corner with CapEx. And this last year, CapEx was about $10
billion. That's one of the lowest amounts we've had in quite a while. And so I think
we're doing a better job of being really thoughtful with every dollar of capital. Again,
we've always been disciplined but I think our discipline continues to improve around
capital.
Dividends, you would've seen that we just increased it for the 45th consecutive year.
We're very committed to our dividend and continuing to increase that in the future.
On share repurchases, we announced a $20 billion share repurchase program last
year, last October, that we said we would utilize over about a couple of years. We still
believe that'll be the case. And so we're committed to our company and we believe
our company continues to be a good value from a share repurchase standpoint. And
we continue to make choices. We've made a lot more of these in the last couple of
years. And even this last quarter, you saw us rightsize the Sam's Club ﬂeet. We
decided to close the ﬁrst part of e-commerce business in Brazil. Earlier in the year,
we sold Suburbia, which is a great business. And Walmex. But not part of our core.
We've been talking about realigning the U.S. pipeline. So there's a number of things
that we continue to do as a company and take decisions that allow us to continue to
be focused where we need to focus long term.
So I'll spend a couple of minutes on Walmart U.S. e-commerce. This is a chart that we
would have showed in October where we said we'd end up with about $11.5 billion
of sales for the year, which is pretty close to where we ended up -- actually almost
right on where we ended up for the year and where we reiterated a couple of weeks
ago our expectation of 40% growth for this current year. And we expect that -- the
growth rate to go from their levels it was in the Fourth Quarter and move up as the
year goes along. We'll be comping things like 2-day free shipping in the First
Quarter. But we expect that to move up through the year and be about 40% for the
full year.
So how do we do that? We talked about the Fourth Quarter and we were at 23% in
the Fourth Quarter. And there were a number of things related to that. We did plan
down our quarter. And we did that from the standpoint that we did some things in
the Fourth Quarter the prior year that were more promotional than we thought we
needed to be in this year's Fourth Quarter. And so we made some decisions around
that. We still came in a little lower than we wanted to and had planned to. But we did
plan for that to be down. But there's a number of things, as we go into the year, that
are still very true about this business and I'll start in the upper right -- actually in the
center with nailing the fundamentals. We're still fairly new. As an e-commerce
company, there's things that we're always continually doing better. And you've heard
Marc Lore talk about our customer value index or CVI. And it's really those 5 things
in the upper right-hand corner of have it, ﬁnd it, display it, price it and deliver it, justFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-06
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 10be really good at the fundamentals of e-commerce. And we're getting better and
better at that every day and we track it meticulously. So there -- part of our growth is
going to come from just continuing to get better at what we do on a day-to-day
basis. We continue to expand the brand. Jet.com was an important part of that
extension of the brand. If you've seen our advertising lately, if you saw it during the
Oscars, much more about omni-channel. That omni-customer is incredibly important
to our business. And so we're continuing to focus on e-commerce, the stores. But
more importantly, how do we get that shopper to shop both.
Store No. 8 is helping us think about the future and we have a group of people that,
for the most part, they're thinking three years out, ﬁve years out, 10 years out. What
are the things that we can do in the future to make the customer experience better?
And what can we do from a partnership standpoint, things like we did with Google,
that can accelerate some of the things that we want to do longer term? And on the
left. So play oﬀense, that's really -- that's who we are. That's how we win long term is
these things right here. So when we acquired Jet, smart cart was a really interesting
part of that business. And that's something that we'll continue to use Jet, of course.
But you'll see pieces of that work its way into walmart.com over time.
On the experience side, Online Grocery has been a tremendous success. We had
1,100 stores this last year and we expect to have about a little over 2,000 as we come
out of this current year. The really important part of what we do, our customers love
this and it continues to get us more top of mind with that customer. We're going to
continue to look for ways to utilize our stores and our e-commerce teams together
and our businesses together because we believe long term that's where we win as a
company, is getting those 2 things in sync. We talked about in our release that we've
been testing grocery delivery. There are some things that we want to accelerate as
we go throughout the year with grocery delivery that we think can be another leg of
growth for the company.
So let me go and talk just a little bit about our guidance. You would've seen all of
this. But make just a couple of comments. So net sales growth of 1.5% to 2%, of
course, that compares to what we said in last October of around 3%. The major
diﬀerence there is Sam's Club and the club closures and the decision to pull out of
tobacco in some of our clubs. And that's the diﬀerence. But a comparative number,
the 3% we said earlier.
U.S. comp sales of at least 2%. You've seen those kind of growth rates in the third
and the Fourth Quarter. And we expect that to continue as we go throughout the
year. Really good momentum at Sam's Club. Walmart International, 3% on that large
of a base. Obviously, within the country, there's a wide range of how you get to that
3% but a good healthy number. And operating income, we have gotten a lot of
questions on operating income. And so when we talked about, it was a range of
4.3% to 4.4%, again driven by the catalyst of tax reform. So it's down a little bit from
where we'd be last year. And we said versus operating income, down a low single-
digit percentage in dollars from where we were last year. But again, tax reform is a
catalyst of why we decided to continue to invest in the business. And so that's theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-06
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 10Q - Beryl Bugatch
A - Brett M. Biggsdecision we made and why operating income, we wanted to give you that guidance.
So you can have a sense of where we think we'll be for the year.
But from an EPS perspective, projecting to grow 7% to 13%, which is an incredibly
healthy number given all the things that we're doing, the investment that we're
trying to make. But still be able to grow earnings at a rate of 7% to 13%, we feel really
good about as a company.
So let me close out and almost close out where I started, which is I like how we
exited '18. I like how we're entering '19. There's a lot of things that we can still do to
drive more growth, to continue to be more eﬃcient from a cost standpoint. There's
initiatives going all the time and we're working on this every day. There's trade-oﬀs
we need to make as a business. And as an executive team, you would imagine we
spend a lot of time thinking about what those trade-oﬀs are, where do we put our
dollars, what are things that we decide to stop doing. But we want to win long term
and I said earlier we understand the expectations, both short term, midterm, long
term, of our investors and we have the same expectations of ourselves. There are
times where we're going to make -- take opportunities to invest. We felt like this was
a time to do that. But I am every bit as optimistic as I've ever been about this
company. And when you look at the assets that we have in place, both ﬁnancially as
well as the businesses that we have and the levers that we have to pull, pulling all
this together in a way that wins with that omni-channel is critical and I believe we're
one of the few companies that has the chance to do that.
So Budd, I'll turn it over to questions.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
A couple of things the investors are, obviously, very, very mindful of, is the
improvement in Walmart U.S. and the supercenters over the last couple of years. Can
you maybe go and give us a little bit more color of what some of the initiatives that
have really been driving that? And how did that momentum really continue over the
next couple of years?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. The supercenter business continues to be really strong. You've seen it with the
traﬃc and with the comp. And Greg Foran and that team just continue to do a great
job. They had their year beginning meeting just a couple of weeks ago that I was
able to attend. And as you would expect, it's a combination of so many things and
things that they've been doing, some of which just get better. So inventory, down
almost three years in a row now and the stocks are better. That makes the store more
eﬃcient. Some of that's driven by technology. More and more use of self-checkout
on the front end, our customers love that. So as we remodel stores, we have more
and more self-checkout. Customers like that, makes the store more eﬃcient at the
same time. Major focus on fresh. Over the past 3 or four years, we've put a lot of time
and energy into the fresh supply chain. We've taken almost three days out of thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-06
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 10Q - Beryl Bugatch
A - Brett M. Biggs
Q - Beryl Bugatchfresh supply chain, which is a big deal in your home when that produce is still good
three days later than it was before. But the way we're merchandising, the way we're
training, a lot of good changes in the fresh business. And the last one I mentioned is
private label, continue to make great strides in private level. You saw some recent
announcements about some private label apparel brands. One of the things that's
hit me the last two years at the year beginning meeting is the amount of work that's
going on around private label. The packaging is better, the pricing is sharp, really
good products, good feedback from customers. We're going to continue to be a
house of brands, we always have been, always will. But that private label in the future
is going to play a really important part of what we're doing. So I'm excited to see the
growth in that.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
And one of the other critical factors that's been involved and certainly important for
the share price performance has been, in fact, the growth of e-commerce. It's been
great. It was great for the ﬁrst couple of quarters of 2017 and then in (2000). Then in
the Fourth Quarter was a bit less than what we were expecting and what I think The
Street was expecting and less than the 40%, the 23%. Talk about some of the
operational issues that may have impacted that. I know you talked about being a
little bit less promotional. Maybe you can give us some color as to where that was.
Then how do we get some comfort that you will get back to that 40%? And when will
you get back to the 40% growth in e-comm?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. So the operational challenges that I mentioned were more around fulﬁllment.
And so as you start -- you always have this challenge. As you start pulling more
seasonal inventory into a fulﬁllment center, where you have everyday goods, you can
have some challenges with that. We had a few more challenges in the Fourth Quarter
than we would have expected. And that really were -- those were the operational
challenges in the Fourth Quarter. So even though we planned down, we ended up a
bit below where we wanted to be from a plan standpoint. Where we want to go this
year, it's really what I talked about just a minute ago is part of it is just getting better
every day, nailing the fundamentals. We have room to go to be where we want to be
just from a fundamental standpoint. The site redesign, the site redesign that you'll
start seeing pieces of it throughout the year. You saw a piece of it just a couple of
weeks ago with what we're doing with home. We're getting really good reviews from
customers on what we did around home. So a vertical piece of the site. But we
continue to make the site more usable, more appealing to customers. Some of the
acquisitions we've done over the past year or so continue to elevate that Walmart
brand. So we'll never lose a core customer but continue to elevate the brand. When
you elevate the brand, you get more brands. And so continuing to elevate that
experience, all of that is part of why we get comfortable with the guidance we've
given. Now in the First Quarter, I'd say we're up against 2-day free shipping. So we
anticipate that the number, being above where we were in the Fourth Quarter but
continuing to grow as we go throughout the year, we're not going to give quarter-to-
quarter guidance. But for the year, it will be about 40%.

Q - Beryl Bugatch
A - Brett M. Biggs
Q - Beryl Bugatch
A - Brett M. BiggsThere's been a lot of commentary in the media and the investment about the tight
trucking market and Walmart's a major force in the trucking market. Can you talk a
little bit about that sizable ﬂeet that you operate, how that's being impacted by what
we're hearing?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It's a good time to have your own ﬂeet for a lot of reasons. To have the drivers that
we have and the long-tenured associates in that area is so important. Transportation
costs were up a little bit we talked about in the Fourth Quarter. Some of that was fuel
prices are a little bit higher than they were last year, 10% to 12% higher than they
were last year. As you sell more, you move more. And so your transportation costs
can go up a little bit from that perspective as well. We do use some third parties. But
the price pressure that you're reading about and seeing would have less of an
impact on us than it would, I think, some others.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Okay, okay. And the site redesign, we've seen a little bit of that so far. When will that
be complete? Will it be complete all this year?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Probably site redesign will never be complete. We're always going to be working on
the site. But there'll be noticeable things that you see throughout the year.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Okay. Another thing that's been in the media pretty much recently was the actions
taken at Sam's Club and the strategic resizing of that ﬂeet. Can you talk a little bit
about what John's done there, what the prospects are for Sam's Club and maybe
even the move to have totally Member's Mark as a -- as your private brand?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. John and team and there was work already underway. But John and team really
accelerated a number of things around Sam's. And they've gotten more clear about
who that member is that they want to service. It's a broad range. But giving that
member an elevated experience, both from a membership standpoint, getting
membership simpler. So getting the 2 types of memberships is really important. The
merchandising -- I was at a Sam's Club last yesterday, the merchandising was great.
Great pricing on home security and mesh networks and all the things that you want,
right, when you walk in the club. So I think the merchandising has gotten better,
membership's gotten simpler, plus memberships now with free shipping on e-
commerce orders. So they've elevated what you should expect from that
membership. As they looked at the clubs that they wanted to shut, some of that was
around ﬁnancial performance, it always is. But also around ensuring that we have
clubs in the locations that we want to ensure that we serve that member that we're
wanting to serve. Member's Mark now just having, for the most part, one private
label. You'll remember a time, Budd, when it was 10, 12 diﬀerent types of private label
really getting that narrowed in to that one is also an important point for our member
there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-06

Okay. Financially, one of the areas of really good performance has been working
capital performance, particularly payables as a percentage of inventory and looking
at days payables. Where are we on that cycle? Is there any room to go further on
that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think there's always room on working capital. If Greg Foran was here, he would tell
you he goes in stores and he still see places to get inventory in better shape, even
keeping stocks where they should be. And we've made a lot of progress, Budd, in
the last three years. Where we see that kind of improvement that we've seen in the
last three years, hard to say. But we're continuing to work on it. When you're driving
the kind of comps that we are in the U.S., you -- we're driving a lot of growth for
suppliers. And so we want to ensure that we're getting the best deal that we can
given the volume that we're driving.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Okay. And I guess the last question I'll ask before the breakout is operating margin.
You've given some sort of guidance this -- for now of this year. How do we look at
that going forward over the next couple of years? Where do we get -- do we see
operating margin growth over the next several years?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
So we've only given guidance for the one year because of the investments that we
wanted to make this year. We understand returns. There's diﬀerent ways to get to
improved returns. Obviously, operating income going up is one of those. So we're
aware of that and always want to balance that, along with how we win long term.
And I think there's going to be years where it moves a little bit this way, it moves a
little bit this way. But on balance kind of being where we've -- in a range kind of
where we've been, we said that in October and we decided to take it down a little bit
more because of the investments we're making. So we're not going to give guidance
out more than a year. But understand the challenge that creates from a returns
perspective for investors.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Okay. Well thank you very much. And we'll continue this at the breakout.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
