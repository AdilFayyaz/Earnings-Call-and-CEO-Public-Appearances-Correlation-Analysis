Presentation
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Good morning. Welcome. My name is Brent Thill. I run the software research initiative
at UBS. We've had a busy past couple days. We have got another busy day today.
We are extremely pleased to have Julie Larson Green from Microsoft with us. Julie
has spent over the last two decades at Microsoft helping build the foundation of
what has become obviously one of the biggest software companies in the world.
She now leads the Devices and Studios Group, responsible for all the hardware
development, including Xbox, Surface. And accessories. She also led the product
planning, design and delivery of Windows 7, Windows 8. And Windows 8.1. So a
pretty incredible background. Started her career as a developer and is now
responsible, again, for leading a lot of these new initiatives.
As my IR role I'm taking today, during this presentation Julie may make forward-
looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about
future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions
that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results can materially diﬀer.
Microsoft does not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
With that, thanks for coming, Julie.
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
Thanks for having me.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
I guess maybe walk through in your newly deﬁned role what you're doing, the
strategy. And how we should think about the devices strategy as a whole coming
together in the next couple years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-21

Sure. As Steve Ballmer outlined in our July reorganization, it's we are coming
together as a One Microsoft around devices and services as our strategy. So my role
is to bring together all the device projects that were going on inside of Microsoft
and turn it into a family of devices that help people get things done that they wanted
to get done; share with family and be wherever they want to be.
So whether they're mobile or in their living room or at a desk, that they can get
access to the things they care about, the people they care about wherever they are.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
So you have a big role.
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
It's fun.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
And reestablishing -- I think Microsoft has been known for the enterprise side of the
house. On the consumer side it's been a work in progress, if you will. With you think
you can have the biggest impact going forward terms of taking picking a lane to go
after?
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
When I started at Microsoft about 20 years ago I started in developer tools. So it's
basically the bottom layer of the stack with developers that create applications for
our platforms. I moved into Internet Explorer and I helped create the SharePoint
team.
Then I went to Oﬃce and redeﬁned productivity with Oﬃce Ribbon. And I went to
Windows and reinvented the platform. Now my job is to reinvent how we think about
device products and how those things come together.
So Microsoft has been in hardware for a really long time. Our ﬁrst hardware product
was called SoftCard. It was -- it brought basic programming to the Apple II. So we've
always been willing to do hardware when it has furthered the state of the art in
technology.
With the mouse in 1983 and now where we are putting a big push into being there
with the devices that are going to help people in their lives. And it's very exciting.
And it's really fun for me because I'm focused on the design of the end product,
which has always kind of been my thing that I like to think about; the delivery of the
device, what it looks like when you open it up and what it's like when you take it outFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-21

Julie Larson-Greenof the box, what your ﬁrst experience is and what your experiences over time. And
then that perfect role for that.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
What do you think the biggest opportunity is? I think a lot of our clients look at
mobility and say this is probably your biggest opportunity. You know, Surface is
interesting. But when you look at the number of mobile phones that are out there,
this is clearly your biggest, probably, challenge and biggest opportunity.
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
Deﬁnitely. I think mobility is going to continue to change. Mobility today people
think about a cell phone or a tablet. But there's what we kind of call ubiquitous
computing or things that are going to be in devices in your home, on your body. So
it's going to continue to evolve.
It's a very exciting time to kind of have this services strategy where you can get
access to all the data and information that you care about; the people, the
documents, your entertainment, all the things in your life from whatever is most
convenient to you at the time. So looking at the family of devices, mobility is a huge
part of how people live and work and interact today. So we will be there with those
devices.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
You are facing some formidable competitors in the space. Some of the analogies of
kind of being multiple laps behind in a car race. How do you eﬀectively step on the
gas and catch up with some of the others that are out there and disrupt year multiple
devices that are in my pocket -- BlackBerry, iPhone -- how do you get that experience
into my family?
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
I think that was the genesis for the restructuring of the Company, because we have
all the elements. We have talented hardware engineers. We have great platform for
building applications on top of those devices -- application platform that scales from
mobile devices to giant large-screen devices to your living room. We have the
services that back those things up and we are uniquely positioned to bring all those
things together.
So by structuring around one strategy for the Company rather than made up of
individual business groups with the best of intentions but their own P&L concerns,
we've will be able to focus the resources of the Company in a new direction. I think it
will help us move faster. Of course the acquisition of Nokia helps, as well, to give us
the engineering muscle and the muscle in inventory management and
manufacturing to scale quickly.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-21

The other thing our clients have asked about is just the ecosystem that's working
with you. Many of the software participants in the Valley have spoke about we need
Microsoft to get to a certain % of market share before we can really start to commit
dollars; one small business company that says we've got to see them over 10% share
before we can take them very seriously. From your perspective, how are you
planning that ecosystem back to kind of help you in delivering this message?
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
Sure. Again, that restructuring helps, because now we have one operating system
group so you can target all of the devices in -- no matter if it's a phone, a tablet, PC,
an Xbox -- which launches today, by the way, tonight at midnight. You can target all
of those things as a developer. So it helps build the number of people that you can
reach or the number of customers that you can get access to.
It also makes it easier for you to play across a set a platforms or set of devices with
one platform. We are doing well in some markets. So it's kind of a chicken and egg
thing.
You have to have the apps to get people to want to be on your platform. You have to
have people on your platform to want to get -- people who want to get the apps. It
can be a slow start.
Even Android wasn't fast. It took 18 months or so before they had critical mass. And
so we feel like we are on track. We just got Instagram on Windows Phone yesterday.
And so we are starting to see the players coming. We have YouTube on Xbox One.
We are starting to see the momentum building.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
You mentioned Xbox One. I will be in line tomorrow at the local Windows store.
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
Tonight, at midnight?
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
I won't be there at midnight tonight. But the last major console was eight years ago.
How do you think about what's diﬀerent with One?
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
Sure. There's a number of diﬀerent -- I mean the world is a lot diﬀerent than eight
years ago. We are moving entertainment beyond just gaming into encompassingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-21
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 17Brent Thill
Julie Larson-Greenmore of what you do in your home.
And so with Xbox One we start a new generation of entertainment console that is
more than just hard-core gamers. So you will be able to interact in a natural way with
your voice, with gesture. You will be able to say Xbox on to turn your TV on and start
watching TV. Say Xbox ESPN to take you to the channel immediately.
So it's really going to change the way you think about interacting with your TV. So
you're not grabbing those remotes and trying to ﬁnd what button to push. You can
just speak naturally to the device. And it's also just a great showcase of what
Microsoft has to oﬀer.
It brings together Skype -- you can do Skype calls on your big screen. That really
changes how interactive it is for your family. So you can call loved ones far away and
have your whole family sitting around and see the person. It really brings -- when in a
business you think of videoconferencing, because there's a lot of similarities to it. But
it brings it to the home.
Of course, you can also videoconference with your Xbox. Maybe it will be showing
up in the boardroom, as well. But there is SkyDrive integration. It's really the best of
Microsoft, across all of our devices. You start to see the vision that we have for how
these things connect together.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
A lot of questions as it relates to you're not going to be alone with a new box. You
had Sony come a little earlier with a slightly lower price point. One of the questions
we get is, when you look across the specs, they look fairly similar. So why am I going
to pay hundred dollars more for One versus Sony? Maybe you can walk through why
the delta in the price point.
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
Sure. You're going to pay a little more for the better experience. I mean, they have a
great gaming platform and it's centered around gaming. So we are extending you
into the living room with your TV and entertainment. We are extending you with very
high quality voice and gesture recognition.
The Xbox -- some of our Xbox games, we have a ﬁtness game that can tell your pulse
when you are in front of the device working out. It will show you the muscles that are
being used, tell you whether you are using your muscles eﬃciently or not. And tell
you your pulse just from seeing your face.
So there's all kinds of very cool innovation in there that will really change the way
you think about it. It's not just sitting on the couch with a controller and playing a
game; it's so much more than that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-21

When you think about --
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
Although my 13-year-old son sits on the couch with the controller all the time.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
When you think about the kids -- at least my three kids -- and the way that they are
interacting now they are taking my wife's iPhone and my iPhone out of my pocket
and they are downloading 15 apps in the next thing you know all these apps
downloaded. So the way the younger generation is consuming entertainment has
changed. How do you participate in that type of environment going forward?
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
Sure. So -- well, I have a 13-year-old at home who loves gaming. I get texts from him. I
know when he says, quotes love you, mom, it's followed by can I get for $0.99. So it's
a very big part of how kids are growing up today, is growing up with technology.
More than just gaming, they are also growing up with writing with a pen on glass,
which is something that we didn't grow up with. So it feels diﬀerent to us and it feels
more natural to them. I think with Surface, our touch keyboards -- the one that is not
mechanical keys. But uses all touch. So a touch cover, there's a diﬀerent experience
that they have because they don't have the preconception of what it was like to type
on physical keys.
So seeing what kids do with the technology today without the past in their head has
been really fascinating. Helping them with -- that's why Surface has been a great
device, because it can help you get your homework done. It has oﬃce and all those
things on it.
But it also has all the entertainment and movie watching and games and things. And
Smart Glass to connect to your Xbox in ways that you can really get your whole life
done, even if you're a child. It's been fun to watch how diﬀerently they grow up on
what they're doing.
My favorite feature on Xbox is actually a very little known feature. On my Windows
Phone I can see when my son is playing or not. And if he supposed to be doing
homework, I can send him a message from my phone to the Xbox -- because he
won't answer his phone when is playing -- but he sees a message come up. Mom:
get oﬀ the Xbox. Do your homework.

{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
I'm working on that one.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
I'd like that feature for my kids.
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
That's a good feature to add. You're done now.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Microsoft Game Studios has been a pretty important component in driving Xbox
demand. There's no Halo or Gears of War, these big massive titles right at launch.
Can you walk through how that plays out over time? What currently right now are the
titles that you're most excited about?
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
Sure. So we have several new titles. We have a redesigned Forza -- Forza 5. It's
beautiful; it's got cars that you can drive that you would probably never be able to
see in person that are just spectacular, just gorgeous.
We have Ryse, which is a new game that takes what you can do with graphics to a
really new level. It looks so realistic and the way the grass moves. And the
shadowing. And the wind blowing and the water is just a super realistic experience.
But there's lots of exciting games coming. Those are two of the big ones that are out
and I've been playing and learning and having fun with.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Maybe turning to Surface now, you've learned a lot, I think, from your initial launch
and you've gotten a lot of feedback from clients. From your perspective what are the
next things you'd like to do with Surface? What are the most important milestones
you hope to pass for the next year?
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
Sure. So Surface has been a fun project. Really, when we created it we created it to
be a stage for Windows 8, to be the representation of the experience that we were
trying to create. The combination of powerful productivity where you plug in theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-21
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 17Brent Thill
Julie Larson-Greenkeyboard. But also the simplicity of a tablet when you don't. And touch interactive
interaction is a ﬁrst-class way of interacting with the device.
We've learned a lot both in the operating system and the changes we made in 8.1 to
respond to customer feedback to make that experience smoother. And we've also
learned on the hardware -- longer battery life, lighter weight. But we also are
continuing to innovate in thinking about the docking station or that touch ﬁrst
keyboard, or some of the things that we are doing that are unique.
So on the touch cover you can swipe -- on Windows 8 you can swipe from the sides.
You can use the keyboard now to swipe as well, or run your ﬁnger along the top of
the keys to erase words on the Word documents. So really, working on scenarios in
eﬃciency.
But more so going forward Surface is a stage for all of Microsoft, not just for
Windows 8. So it brings together the best that Microsoft has to oﬀer with Skype, with
SkyDrive, with all the things that Microsoft does -- powered by Bing and Bing search.
So it brings a full value of Microsoft into one device.
I think there's diﬀerent sizes, diﬀerent price points, new hardware technologies and
opportunities. There's all kinds of things that we are working on.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
As you've expanded the hardware product line, there's been the natural question of
tension with your other partners that are providing a lot of the alternative interfaces
that you can buy. Just maybe walk through why you chose to embark down that
path. And how you're managing the tension of the channel obviously wanting to be
part of your ecosystem. But you have had to make some moves that are --
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
Sure. We love what our OEMs are doing. I mean they are providing all kinds of
diﬀerent sizes and price points and colors and shapes. And all kinds of innovation
into the market.
What we learned was when you're developing an operating system, the end-to-end
of the hardware to the software, we felt we could do a good job of spurring software
innovation by innovating in the hardware. And spurring hardware innovation by
innovating in the software and owning that end-to-end stack. Then making that
available to OEMs to be able to go in and do things with.
We thought we would learn a lot about the challenges that they go through, the cost
structure that they have to build into and deploy devices, that we could automate
and do things in our system to make that easier for them going forward. And we also
-- when you're developing operating systems like Windows 8, there was no hardwareFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-21
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 17Brent Thill
Julie Larson-Greenout there that did the things that we wanted it to do. There was no -- actually, when
we started planning, there wasn't even the iPad.
We had the idea of a tablet of a certain size and with edges -- 10-ﬁnger touch and
edges that went all the way to the edge that you can swipe from the sides. But that
wasn't any device like that. So we prototyped and innovated in those areas and then
brought that to the ecosystem. So we think it helps to build more capability across
the ecosystem to have us think about the whole stack.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
And maybe that plays into the Nokia question about what can you do with Nokia as
part of your team. I mean, you had a close relationship already. A lot of our clients
have asked, well, you could have just continued down this partnership route. Why --?
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
Right. It's actually about removing the seams in the experience. So the Nokia camera
is amazing. But it sits on top of the operating system. So it doesn't integrate in, in the
experience, the way you expect.
You have multiple camera apps, you have multiple storage places, you have multiple
ways to upload. So being able to remove those seams and talk more freely about the
future direction of what's the operating system and what they are thinking to bring
that into the experience.
We just announced today the Dragon Time app, which takes their -- it's a kids game,
it's designed to sit back with your phone or with your tablet and kids play a game.
The game takes advantage of all the geospatial information that Nokia has and will
give you, in the game, real-time weather, traﬃc routing and things like that to make
the game more interesting.
So if it's raining outside it shows that it's raining in the game. If there's a traﬃc jam in
trying to get to the capital because this traﬃc jam when mom is driving traﬃc, it will
show you that in the game. So those are things that are above the operating system
today and things that we can bring down into the operating system to make
available to all apps, not just apps on top of Nokia. So there's that. But a big part of it
as well is just amazing quality of the engineering team that they have there, the
capabilities that they bring to bear the we can put across all of our devices: camera
technology, audio technology, imaging technology -- just diﬀerent things that they
have, as well as supply chain, inventory management and all the parts that they do
so well.
Even things like I've had questions about the music experience. So Nokia has a new
music experience, we have a music experience. It turns out we are not in all the same
countries. That really helps us bring a more worldwide focus to the things that we are
doing with the distribution channels they have and just the way that they think about
delivering their products.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-21

You have arguably one of the most important roles in Microsoft now. Given the
transition with Steve's departure, there are a lot of questions about your autonomy
and your ability to plan the roadmaps about having the CEO to sign oﬀ on it. Can
you just help us understand -- maybe it's a misperception. But your ability to lead
your team without --.
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
Sure. Having the strategy really helps as we work together as a management team.
And so is not as dependent on one decider, I guess I would call it, as it is a group
eﬀort for us to work together and plan the roadmap and the direction. And the high-
value activities that we want to deliver the customers on the devices that we think
people need and want.
So that hasn't slowed us down at all. We are working hard on the future direction and
roadmap in working across Chilu's organization, Satya's organization, talking about
how to add more Enterprise capabilities to the device.
Is there hardware things we can do in our devices that would make it easier to
Enterprise? How do we lower the barrier for BYOD devices in the Enterprise? Then,
of course, working with Terry Meissen in the operating system team to provide the
capabilities that we need to make those devices shine.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
You know Windows better than anyone. And so there's a lot of questions from our
clients. You know, the grizzly bears say the Windows business is trending to zero. The
bulls will say it's going to be an integral part of the system forever.
Can you just update us on your view on where Windows goes as the core, or less.
And how to think of it? We had our IT panel before this and one of the statements
that they had made was they felt you were due for a resurrection, that you had so
many great assets that you could bring to bear that, with Azure, there's actually a lot
of things that our ﬁrm is doing now that we couldn't potentially do before.
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
I like that analyst. Yes, I agree with that. I think we do have a lot of things to bring to
bear.
I think we've been working on becoming more modern in our thinking, both in the
cloud infrastructure and how you access that to build applications and run your
business. And in the operating system itself in thinking about how Windows can
scale from a small device to large device, up to a server. And the power that givesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-21

Brent Thilldevelopers and IT professionals to manage those devices and to give information
out to people in their business no matter where they are.
So I think there will always be -- for a long time -- for my lifetime there will be a
desktop computer where people are doing precision movements with a mouse,
which are highly tuned towards productivity and typing, as well as maybe something
on your wrist or something on your head or something in your pocket that you will
want to interact and see your emails, your notiﬁcations. Get access to corporate data
that you need to do your job, as well as interact with friends and family. So yes, I
think we are very poised.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
One of the other big questions I get is just the traditional decline of the PC. But your
role in the cloud, I think you're doing a lot more behind the scenes than maybe
people understand.
You kind of mentioned this with all these diﬀerent devices, I would assume there's
got to be meaning in how they connect and there is a way that I think the cloud plays
a role on that. So if maybe you could just put into context across what you're doing
and what the Company's doing and how the cloud is bringing this to life?
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
Sure. I mean, deﬁnitely we believe in the power of the device and that there are
things that the device can do. So thin client computing isn't going to be everything.
This always thinks you want to do locally, or you can do better running locally.
But having your data and information stored remotely so you can access it from
anywhere is deﬁnitely a big -- a trend industrywide. But deﬁnitely something that
we've been working on for quite a long time. So I think tablets just opened up -- it
does replace some PCs. But it also opens up an opportunity for people as an
additional device for them to go in and use their phone as an additional device.
We are working on a world where we can make it easy for you to have many diﬀerent
devices in your life. So signing in with your Live ID on a new device gives you back
everything that you had on your old device. So the cost of switching two devices is
lower, adding additional ones doesn't take as much setup time. So we are really
focused on making devices and services integrated in your life, in however you want
them integrated in.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
The pressure that you kind of face in mobile, there's a lot of questions on can they
ever get back in? You guys came into the entertainment market with basically
nothing and got to number one. So you have passed milestones that you can point
to where you really came around and did a great job.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-21

Julie Larson-GreenI guess when you look at mobile and the experience that you can create there, what
do you think is going to be really important to get you going again? A lot of the
feedback we get is, does this just need a rebranding? Why do you -- if go to the x-
phone or some type of rebranding versus away from the Windows Phone, you kick
around a lot of diﬀerent scenarios; I'm curious what you think is --
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
I think there's a number of diﬀerent things. One of them is we are seeing momentum
in mobile outside the United States, in places like Italy where Windows Phone is 20%
market share.
So there's business model things as well, where unsubsidized markets we do better
in than subsidized markets like the US. So there's that -- there's thinking about
business models.
But there's also thinking around where -- what kinds of devices are about the future.
So is not just about phones and PCs. You know, phones are being costed down and
disposable. There is an inﬂection point coming that's something else beyond
phones and tablets.
Of course, they're critically important for us to continue working on. And we believe
we have plans -- part of the power is bringing those things together and being able
to transition from one to the other, for having your phone know you when you walk
up to your PC and having good things happen, or walking into your living room and
having your calendar show up if you wanted to, on your Xbox. Just permeating
technology through your life and making it available to you wherever you are.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
It sounds like you've got a library of really good ideas but we're going to have to
wait and hear about more of these.
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
I'm just getting started. I mean, we have a lot of exciting things coming. Even next
year you'll start to see some really exciting things.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Maybe when you think about the power of kind of a one single sign on across all, in
one common platform, it would seem to make it easier for everyone's consumer life.
It would also make it easier for the developers to have one common platform. Is that
the idea that we are going to see?

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantYes. That's deﬁnitely the idea. Also you want to make it easy for the enterprise. Make
sure that the enterprise has a way to sign on and an easy way for them to separate
corporate data from personal data, as well.
So there's deﬁnitely a lot of thinking about -- I usually tell my team, people that have
devices in order to buy them, they probably have a job. So we need to think about
the full breadth of their workday, because their workday doesn't stop when they go
home. And their home life doesn't stop when they go to work.
So how can we bridge those things. And also respect the needs of the Corporation
to keep tabs on the data and the information that they are letting their employees
walk out the door with?
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
So the vision of having one phone in your pocket is alive?
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
It is deﬁnitely alive. Yes. Although we don't mind if you have three or four. Have a 6-
inch one when you are traveling on the train and you are using public transit so you
can see more and do more. Then when you are out in the evening and you only have
your suit or your evening dress, you have a small one that slips in your pocket. You
can buy more than one.

I just got back from a trip from Finland and now I have a 1520, 1820, a 925. It's fun.
Questions And Answers
There was a time long ago when some of us used Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect. And
you know, for some reason, probably DOS, the water hit the rock and it went left.
And that was the way the world went. It went to Oﬃce, basically.
Now, in device, the world -- fast-forward and Apple has this huge, entrenched
ecosystem. When you are competing, particularly in device, how are you going to
change the culture from -- you were the beneﬁciary and you were the river that was
going. And you had the cash ﬂow and everything like that, to being the outsider
looking in? How are you going to overcome that diﬃculty?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-21

I would say through hardware innovation. My ﬁrst job was writing an import ﬁlter for
WordPerfect. Actually, my very ﬁrst job was doing support at the University on
WordPerfect and Lotus Symphony, in the lab. Then, my ﬁrst real paid job import
ﬁlters for WordPerfect to Page Maker. So I know that world pretty well.
What happened was there was in inﬂection -- a user interface inﬂection with the
mouse -- and WordPerfect didn't keep up with that. They didn't go and embrace the
mouse. So again, with Apple there was an inﬂection point with tablets, or with
phones with touch.
So we had mobile phones -- smart phones before that. But they were based in the
key -- like BlackBerry as well. There was a keypad and it was trying to -- and a stylus. It
was trying to use concepts of Windows on a smaller device.
So they came in with a bunch of technology to come together in size, weight, power.
But the real invention was touch. And that changed and created the new revolution,
which is just why in Windows 8 we became touch ﬁrst in our thinking, to try to -- we
knew touch would be was going to be a big deal. We added it in Windows 7 but we
really exploited it in Windows 8 to rethink that experience.
There will be another inﬂection point and it's going to come from the hardware input
model. So that's why you've seen us doing things with connect, with gesture. You
have seen us doing things with voice, because there is one coming. All of the things
have to come together.
We were ﬁrst with tablets, you could say. But the technology wasn't actually there to
make it a mobile thing that you would carry around. The idea of a tablet, being able
to take notes, take it with you, was stuck on a 5-pound luggable. And now it's in a
sleek, thin little piece.
So all those elements have to come together. And we believe it comes from an input
model or user experience inﬂection point with the hardware, which is why we are in
devices and why I'm really excited about my job.
What about all the apps and the iOS ecosystem? How do you overcome that?
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
You enable a new kind of app. They were very successful in creating a curated set of
applications that took what most people were trying to do on the web and made it
valuable to do it on the device. And created a model for them to get paid and get all
those things.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-21

A - Julie Larson-GreenThere will be another one of those coming, is my belief. You already start to see
some of it. I think connecting apps to each other, because so many things are
special-purpose, you will start to see new ways for apps to integrate across.
I think there is a lot that's going to come from the web and smart information about
you and where -- your location. So sensors are going to become a big part of how
you think about things. Some of the things we have been talking about is, you see all
these ﬁtness devices that people wear on their wrists and they do some interesting
things.
What's the extension of that? What are the sensors and things we can build that help
you in your daily life? From telling you that you didn't quite do your push-up as far
down as you really thought you could go; to letting you know that it's time to take --
your heart rate is too high and you must be stressed out. Take a big, deep breath --
to letting you know when your bus is running late at the bus stop and -- your bus is
running late.
So there's lots of things we can do by bringing those things together in a new way of
thinking about how people interact with technology. I don't think -- just as the mouse
was an invention, touch was an invention, there will be the next new way to interact.
And that's why we have been focusing on natural user interface for a while -- working
on that.
Could we come a bit back to the Surface? It could be said that the launch of a dual
track last year, RT and Windows 8, was somewhat confusing for the supply chain and
the consumer.
Do you think it's still a viable route here for that dual track to continue as you've
done a refresh this year? Or do you actually think we need a proper reboot of RT,
from the start? I guess the answering question to that is, exactly what has RT
achieved, from your standpoint?
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
Sure. Windows RT -- I think there are clearly -- when you look out in the industry,
there is clearly a need for a simpliﬁed consumer electronics experience on devices.
So you look at iPad in particular and it's a turnkey, closed system. It doesn't degrade
over time, it doesn't get viruses.
It's not as ﬂexible. You can't do as much with it. But it's just more seamless
experience, even though more simpliﬁed.
Windows can do anything you want it to do. You can write all the way to the metal.
You can add things into your startup group that will aﬀect your battery life long-term.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-21

A - Julie Larson-GreenThere are cool powerful scenarios. But they come with a cost in mobility. So
Windows on ARM, or Windows RT, was our ﬁrst go at creating that more closed
turnkey experience. So where it doesn't have all the ﬂexibility of Windows. But it has
the power of Oﬃce and then all of the new style applications.
So you could give it to your kid and he's not going to load it up with a bunch of
toolbars accidentally, out of Internet Explorer. And then come to you later, saying
why am I getting all these pop-ups? It just isn't capable of doing that, by design.
So the goal was to deliver two kinds of experiences into the market: the full power of
your Windows PC and the simplicity of a tablet experience that can also be
productive. That was the goal.
There may be not enough -- I think we didn't explain that super well. I think we didn't
diﬀerentiate the devices super well. They looked similar, using them is similar. It just
didn't do everything you expected Windows to do.
So there's been a lot of talk about, should it have been a rebranding? Should we not
have called it Windows? How should we have made it more diﬀerentiated?
I think over time you will see us continue to diﬀerentiate it more. We have the
Windows Phone OS, we have Windows RT. And we have full Windows. We are not
going to have three.
We do think there is a world where there is a more mobile operating system that
doesn't have the risk the battery life or the risk to security. But it also comes with a
cost of ﬂexibility. So we believe in that vision and that direction and we are
continuing down that path.
When you started your presentation you used quote, unquote One Microsoft. That's
a new concept, right?
And I know every division had their own P&L. It's very diﬃcult. It seems like they all
had their ego. To work together as One Microsoft, quote, unquote, I believe you
guys have the capability to all these things you want to do.
But I'm not sure how long it would take you to get to break down these walls to
collaborate to One Microsoft. Can you tell me how your thoughts on that would be?
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
Sure. So we were all part of coming up with the strategy. We've been talking for a
long time -- when I ran the Windows organization, my job was to really get other
groups inside of Microsoft to bet on the platform.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-21

A - Julie Larson-GreenWe had Bing build apps for us. We had Xbox team build music and video. That
became the default music and video experience for Windows. We had Oﬃce
building One Note on our new experience.
So it's not completely foreign to us, to kind of work cross-group. But the incentives in
how you worked -- we had diﬀerent ship cycles, we had diﬀerent P&L goals. There
was no mal-intent, it was just we were busy with our own things.
Now we are busy with one thing. We are busy with bringing together the experience
for customers at a Microsoft level. So we have operationalized it in a completely
diﬀerent way.
We are working together on plans. Each team is going oﬀ and working on -- we have
a shared vision, shared roadmap. We have individual teams going oﬀ and working
on cross-team scenarios. We meet weekly, as a SLT leadership team to checkpoint
where we are at and where we want to go. And what challenges we have.
We have product leadership oﬀsite where we are working cross-company scenarios.
That's all new for us. So really it can't be just in a -- say we are going to be One
Microsoft and then divide into these diﬀerent functional teams.
You have to actually put in the ecosystem, or the things in place that will make it real;
the new lines of communication, new lines of accountability, new lines of -- new ways
of decision-making. And we are doing all of that.
