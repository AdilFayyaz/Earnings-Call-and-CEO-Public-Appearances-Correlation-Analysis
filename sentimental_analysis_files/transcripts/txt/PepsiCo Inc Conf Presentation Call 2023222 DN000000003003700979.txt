Presentation
Hi, again. Now, it gives me great honor and pleasure to introduce PepsiCo, one of
the largest global consumer package good company with more than $86 billion in
net revenue. And their senior management team lead by Mr. Ramon Laguarta,
Chairman and CEO; and Mr. Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and CFO.
Ramon and Hugh have nearly 60 years of good buying [ph] experience at PepsiCO,
and has been in numerous roles that stand across the company, including general
management, sales, operations and ﬁnance. Following Ramon's elevation to the CEO
role in the fall of 2018, the company began to undertake a bold agenda to
meaningfully accelerate topline growth. That involved numerous investment
decisions and actions that have led to strong performance we have witnessed in
recent years.
With that in mind, Ramon will now take you through the decisions and actions in
more detail, and the company's priorities moving forward. Ramon, I will now turn it
over to you.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you, James. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for hosting
us. It's great to be back together after so many years of being virtually. So before IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 2 of 16get -- we get started, I'd like to please read our cautionary statements, and we will
get going.
Okay. So I thought we would focus our time on three things: one is, a bit of a
refresher who we are. We've grown a lot in the last few years. I'll give you a good
sense from the category point-of-view from geography where we stand. I'll spend
most of the time taking through -- you through the -- how we're accelerating our
performance in the last few years based on a few decisions that we made. And at the
same time, how we're transforming the company end-to-end to become sustainable
for the future. And then we'll spend the balance of the time talking about the future,
how we think we can continue to take a lot of growth from the market and continue
to create value for our shareholders.
Before we -- I get started, I'd like to take one minute to thank all our teams around
the world, our highly experienced local management team, especially our front-line
that have done an amazing job over the last four years and navigating what it has
been, obviously, very complex realities and with COVID and everything else.
Now, who are we? As Jim mentioned, we are one of the largest food and beverage
companies in the world. We have closed '22 with $86 billion in net revenue and a bit
more than $12 billion in operating proﬁt in '22. As you see our brands, we have a
portfolio of beautiful brands that consumers love, buy very regularly around the
world, some of them billion-dollar plus brand, some of them with smaller but
growing very fast. And I put here winning with net positive as this is the strategy
we've been following for the last few years and it continues to be North Star of our
company.
Now when you look at the two categories that we play on: convenient foods and
beverages, both very large categories complementary in a good sense on the
consumer side, on the customer side on a lot of occasions. Our business is 58%
convenient foods, so almost $50 billion of convenient food, and about 42% in
beverages, $36 billion.
On foods, we're the leading player in convenient foods with a very focused on
savory snacks about expanding to other micro snacks occasions. And on beverages,
we're the number two globally with pockets of leadership in many markets, and
pockets of being a challenging -- a challenging player in some other markets. We
play across most of the other LRB categories, especially here in the US from other
European markets. But there's clearly a lot of opportunities for us to expand further
into other LRB occasions.
Now from the geography point-of-view, we are a very large North America business,
$49 billion in the US, the rest being Canada, 61% being in North America, 39% being
international, about $34 billion of very large international business that is growing
very fast. 31% of our business is in developing and emerging markets. So $27 billion
when you put it against some of the other companies in the food space, clearly, a
very large D&E market portfolio. Now you have the breakdown between the diﬀerentFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 16operating divisions. So Frito-Lay 27%, PBNA 30% and then pretty big in Europe, Latin
America and growing very fast in what we call AMESA, the Middle-East and Southern
Asia and then APAC, our China business and Asia business.
Now what happened to us in the last few years? If you recall, last time we were here
live, we presented to you, that was early '19. We presented to you a new strategy for
the company trying to move from being a good company to being a great company,
pivoting to growth, putting growth at the center of our strategy, how would create
value for all of you regularly.
There were a few key pillars of that strategy, becoming a faster company,
accelerating our investments are becoming much more consumer-centric. Being a
stronger company, elevating eﬃciency as part of our strategy, holistic cost
management and elevating talent and empowering our operations globally to be
much more owners of their decision end-to-end in the marketplace. And then
becoming a better company, elevating people and planet to the center of how we
compete our brands compete in the marketplace, create value for consumers and
customers and communities, with the objective of continuing to deliver consistently
on our long-term algorithm of four to six organic revenue growth and high single-
digit operating EPS.
Now, let me take you through each one of these pillars. So we got to unpack [ph] a
bit more what's happened. The ﬁrst decision we made was to increase our A&M and
increase our CapEx in a very substantial way because we thought the company was
under-invested in their brand, under-invested in their capital. As you see there, 24%
increase in A&M over the last four years. Now our A&M is $5.2 billion, mostly against
our large global brands, but also investing in building new smaller brands that ﬁll the
portfolio in new cohorts or new spaces are obviously coming up in our categories.
We're being very diligent on improving the ROI on our brands, making sure they're
working. A&M is much -- it's getting larger every year against non-working A&M. And
all the eﬃciency metrics that you can expect from a company like ours under A&M.
On the other hand, we increased our net capital investment substantially as well
against three key areas: one, investing in capacity and debottlenecking [ph] our
bottleneck -- our supply-chain. Second, digital investments, make sure that we
become a more intelligent company, more precise, more agile, more forward-
thinking. And the third one, making sure that our go-to-market, you get even more
capillarity to become more extensive as we're trying to get our products in front of
consumers.
Now, the results so far have been pretty good. The business has reacted pretty well
to the investments that you can see the 2022 average growth for the company has
been 9.4%. On the top line, 8% on EPS. Obviously, we have COVID between those
years. So excluding the COVID cost, 11%. So way above our long-term range. Five
consecutive quarters of double-digit top line growth in the last ﬁve quarters and
pretty, two years of double-digit EPS. So very good response of the business to the
investments we've made. And this has been pretty broad as well. So has been in the
US, so big acceleration of our US business going from what was a around a 2% netFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 4 of 16revenue growth for the 2016-2018 timeframe to 7.3% the last three years -- four years
actually. And the same internationally. So the D&A business growing from 7.4% to
11%, while the international business growing from 6% to 9%. And also, both in our
convenient foods and in our beverage business acceleration that is obviously across
most of the geographies that I showed earlier.
Now, as I said earlier, we decided to invest behind our core global brands.
Obviously, it was a ﬁne-tuning their position in improving their packaging, improving
their portfolio under the brand and then increasing the investment behind those
brands that we thought had a -- they had a whole lot of runway. If you see the growth
of some of our global brands is quite positive. So Gatorade grew 13% in the last two
years, Doritos 11%, Cheetos 11%, Lays 9%, et cetera. So a big growth from our global
brands. And as I said earlier, smaller brands that I'll show later that also growing very
nicely along the big global brands.
Portfolio transformation has been critical for those brands to grow at the pace that
they're growing. And I'm showing here three pillars, how we think about our
innovation. Centrally to our portfolio transformation is positive choices, making sure
that our portfolio evolves with the consumer around what we call positive choices in
beverages. That means putting zero sugar at the center of the portfolio
transformation and investing a lot disproportionately our A&M behind zero sugar.
You see here Gatorade, you see here Mountain Dew, Pepsi, obviously, and
innovating in non-sugar brands like Life Water, brands like Propel, brands like Bubly
also driving positive growth for the category.
And in Foods, we're working on the sodium reduction, fat transformation, but also
new substrates, multi-grain in SunChips, Rice and Peas like Oﬀ The Eaten Path,
(inaudible) and emphasizing a couple of cooking methods like baking or popping
that are healthier for consumers. The same we're extending our brands into new
spaces. So for example, if you take the beverage category, we are premiumizing
coﬀee with cold brew, we're premiumizing colas with Nitro. We are moving brands
like Gatorade into caﬀeine or energy plus hydration. We fast it. We are entering gaps
in our portfolio, like we did with Starry, and we are complementing our energy
portfolio with brands like CELSIUS that obviously compliment very well our coﬀee,
our Rockstar or some of our other Energy choices.
The same way the snacks, we move into new substrates like black beans, rice, starra
[ph] in plantains, so diﬀerent ingredients that make our portfolio choices where
consumers much more broader. And then, we're leveraging packaging a lot to oﬀer
new occasions for consumers. I have some examples here, how we're playing, saw
their stream very strategically to move consumers to personalizing their drinks at
home. We're moving into powders and tablets with Gatorade make sure that
consumers also make their choices, make their drinks without plastic, avoiding CO2
emissions with transformation -- with transportation.
And also in the snack business, we're moving into solutions like multi-packs where
we leverage the variety of our portfolio to with consumer choice. It's been a huge
success for us. We have launched Minis, a portable canister for some of our bigFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 5 of 16brands, that's also been very successful. And we're moving into closer to food
solutions with things like walking tacos where consumers can kind of add
ingredients to our tortilla chips or some other products and create their own mini
meals. So clearly, portfolio at the center of how our brands have been very
successful.
We've been investing a lot on e-commerce, making sure that our consumers can ﬁnd
our products in multiple ways. I'll give you some examples of how SodaStream is
obviously using direct-to-consumer in a big way. gatorade.com, how we can -- our
consumers can have -- can be tested on what is their hydration needs and then
adopt their portfolio, powder or other solutions, and they can order obviously their
equipment from that. Or Snacks for You [ph], a platform that we have where
consumers can choose their ideal multi-pack based on whatever family composition
is, whatever their preferences are.
So clearly, investing in e-commerce, beyond e-commerce into D2C. And the same
[ph] away from home, an area where we're growing very fast. We're creating
solutions for our retailers to connect with us and order in a very unique way. We're
investing a lot in food trucks and more giving consumers the opportunity to buy our
products beyond a bag in a much more holistic food experience. And the same with
unattended retail where we have -- we're placing much more equipment in -- for
opportunities for the consumer to buy our products. The net consequence of this is
our net revenue in these channels are growing double digit and accelerating as we
go.
Now that was how much faster -- our faster pillar. If I move to the second pillar was
stronger. Stronger, we wanted to create a company where we elevated eﬃciency at
the center of the strategy, thinking about holistic cost management end-to-end --
looking at cost end-to-end and elevating that in the way we create funding for
investment. We wanted to digitalize the company, make sure we come more agile,
more precise, leaner. And also, we wanted to evolve the culture of the company to
make sure that we empower our people in the ﬁeld to make decisions that are much
more relevant to what is the local context. Those three pillars, I would unpack a little
bit.
In terms of the holistic management, as you can imagine, we've been working on this
for many years now. But we've accelerated the agenda on where do we do the work
and how do we -- how many times across the company we do the work. So we've
invested a lot in global business solutions, and we're trying to minimize the
duplications and maximize the power of doing things once in the company. That's
working very well for us.
We had a very, I would say, multiple technology systems across the company and
systems that were not connected between themselves. We're narrowing that. We're
harmonizing systems across the company, making sure that our people can make
decisions real time in a much more connected way. We're leveraging automation as
much as we can with labor shortages around the world. We keep automating our
packing, our loading, unloading and that is creating a lot of productivity for us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 16And the same with our routes, as we're trying to optimize the way we get to many,
many more points of sale, we're optimizing with intelligence the way our people get
to the store, what they do in the store, how they do it with much more information.
And that's also giving us a lot of productivity. The net result of all this, we've been
delivering above $1 billion of productivity every year for the last four years, and we
continue the journey as we have to continue investing in the business.
Now on the digital side, I want to spend a lot of time on this, but you can imagine
we've invested a lot in AI, we've invested a lot of Internet of Things, automation, et
cetera, to drive the output. I would maybe go deeper on what I think is one of the
most important competitive advantages of our company is the fact that we get to the
point of sale ourselves. And we've been investing in technology and information for
our salesmen to optimize the portfolio with precision store-by-store. So we can read
who lives around that store, who buys in that store, and our salesmen have that
information to optimize the planogram on that particular store to maximize the
throughput. And that has been a pretty powerful tool. I think we have -- we're only
scratching the surface. The more information we get, the more eﬃcient our go-to-
market system work, the more eﬃcient our people are in the point of sale. And you
can read some other areas, obviously, where we're leveraging technology, we're
leveraging information to continue to drive the business forward.
Now this is an important one. Sometimes the soft side doesn't get so much attention.
But I think it's critical in a company global like us, in the environment that we've lived
in the last four years, empowering our local teams and giving them the information,
the compensation, the whole system so they can make the best decisions for that
market given the conditions of the marketplace has been critical for us to elevate our
performance. This is something we started at the beginning of the transformation.
We reorganized, we empowered our people, we delayered. And that's making --
that's made us a much more agile company, much more local, although connected
to a global kind of priorities, but very empowered company.
At the same time, we're elevating diversity. And not only how many male or female
or black people or hispanic people, much more beyond that. And you can see that in
our values, the PepsiCo way. We've elevated voicing opinions fearlessly and raising
the bar on talent diversity of two of the core values of the company. And how do we
maximize really the potential of each one of our associates when they come to work,
we value their diversity and make sure that, that diversity it is reﬂected in the output
of the company. At the same time, as you see in our values, acting as owners,
focused on getting things done, we're trying to become a faster company, much
more empowered when our employees take risks and maximize value for us long
term.
Now this is a passion of mine and a passion of the company. We think that we can
create advantage for our brands, for our people, for our consumers, elevating pep+.
Pep+ is the framework where we put the planet and people at the center of our
brands, at the center of our supply chain, at the center of how we do procurement.
We do agriculture. You can see some of the examples here. But we think that -- and
we will continue to double down on this because we think that PepsiCo will be aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 7 of 16much more durable, better performing company if we continue to invest in these
three pillars of sustainable value chain, positive agriculture and positive choices.
Okay. So that's the past. Now how are we thinking about the future? This is probably
the most important chart that you guys want to think about the potential for growth
of this company. We operate in two beautiful categories, global growing,
accelerating very fast with good economic conditions and performing very well in
diﬃcult economic conditions. So we are fortunate to be playing in two beautiful
categories, global convenient foods and global beverages. These categories are
large, $500 billion, $600 billion and growing nicely, 5%, 5%, driven by population
growth, even by urbanization by a lot of the trends that we're all familiar with.
We have right to win in both categories, but we're still very small in both categories.
If you think about our share of the global convenient foods business, it's only 8%.
And the same in the global beverage business. Clearly, the opportunity to leverage
the growth of the categories and becoming more competitive within the
marketplace, taking occasions into our portfolio in those two large categories is an
amazing opportunity. It is in the US, it is in developed markets and it is in developing
and emerging markets, where, obviously, as you can imagine, that is even a much
bigger opportunity.
Now we want to stick to our strategy, what we have been doing over the last four
years, making sure that we create more smiles every day with every sip and every
bite, make sure that we become a faster, even stronger and even better company,
pep+ at the center. And we live our values, the ones that I was sharing with you
earlier, across our 300,000 people organization.
Now a bit more kind of narrow, how we're going to take that into the diﬀerent large
businesses? So in the US, PepsiCo Foods North America, we think that we have a
huge opportunity to broaden their portfolio, not only to continue to gain occasions
in existing categories but probably expand it even more into macro snacks and
capturing some of that opportunity. And at the same time, moving our portfolio
closer to food, being part of meals, either on kind of the food trucks that I was
showing to you earlier or being part of recipes and how people cook. And there is a
huge opportunity for us to move into those spaces. We'll continue to make our
portfolio stronger around positive choices. We'll continue to reduce sodium. We'll
continue to go into a new substrates, improve the fat, go into new cooking methods,
could be baking, could be popping, it could be other alternative ways.
And we continue to make Frito-Lay and our Quaker business stronger and what is
the number one competitive advantage, which is supply chain and go-to-market.
And that business is extremely powerful in the reach, in the execution capabilities.
We'll continue to invest in capacity. We'll continue to invest in making our go-to-
market stronger, making it more intelligent, more agile, covering away from home,
covering retail, covering e-commerce, direct to consumers. So that's Frito-Lay. We
think that business can continue to grow in a very accelerated pace, still the share of
macro snacks is small, and we can capture a lot of occasions.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 8 of 16The second big business for us in North America, obviously, the beverage business.
We want to compete to win in the marketplace with the portfolio transformation
we've been making, especially around the energy portfolio. We think we can win in
the marketplace. Our sports nutrition business is stronger than ever. Our coﬀee
business, very strong. Our tea business is very strong. Our water business, very
strong. Our energy business, with the inclusion of CELSIUS is very strong, and we are
performing very well with Pepsi and we will do a pretty good job with Mountain Dew.
So clearly, we can win in the marketplace. We'll continue to put zero at the center,
we'll continue to put functionality at the center, we'll continue to put packaging
transformation at the center of how we evolve. We'll optimize our productivity, we
modernize the company and we are conﬁdent that we can continue to improve the
proﬁtability as we've been saying regularly during our investor calls.
Now, the big opportunity for this company is international. International is a huge
opportunity for PepsiCo. When you think about our right to win in the food business
across the world, it is strong and we're continuing to put new layers of advantage to
our businesses in emerging and developing markets, make sure that we -- especially
our savory snack business becomes a very powerful business, proﬁtable and
scalable. The same with LRB. We think that there is huge growth in LRB as more
consumers are moving into commercial beverages around the world. We play very
strong in many markets around the world. We'll continue to invest selectively. We
don't want to go -- we have a strong right to win in some markets and we have low
right to win in some other markets. So we're playing smarter in beverages than we
are in food where we think we can win almost in any geography in the world. But this
is the biggest opportunity. We already have a $34 billion business. We will scale this
business up in the coming years.
Now on the portfolio. I've covered earlier, we're going to continue to put zero and
positive choices at the center of the portfolio transformation. In the food business,
we have the popping technology, the baking technology. We continue to reduce
sodium, the same way as we've done a pretty good job, I think, in changing the
beverage portfolio from full sugar to zero sugar and asking the consumer to make
very little sacriﬁce to go from a very refreshing full sugar beverage to a zero full
sugar beverage -- zero beverage.
We're doing the same in snacks. We're reducing sodium with very little sacriﬁce in
terms of taste for the consumer. The consumer can hardly notice that we're reducing
sodium. And that is the strategy. And that is -- we are -- in some countries, we are way
below the WHO sodium standards already. And consumers haven't even noticed.
They continue to be in love with our products. So this is a strategy we'll continue as
we go forward.
In terms of new occasions, you see there a couple. We believe that the sports
nutrition business has a huge potential for us, right. And it's Gatorade but it's some
other brands like Propel, Muscle Milk, Evolve, some others, we're putting that
together. We're adding personalization. We're adding science to that portfolio. We
put in liquids and solids, we're putting pre-game, during game, after game. We'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 9 of 16giving the consumer a whole set of solutions so that we're empowering this
consumer to -- as consumers think about wellness, very sensible to their lives, we're
going to be there providing them solutions. And you see here some of the alcohol
opportunities that we have. We're tested on learnings. The truth is that we're tested
on learnings, but we have much more learnings now than we had a year ago on how
we can scale this business in the US and potentially internationally.
When you think about the food business, the -- clearly, multipack is a huge idea for
us, but we're starting to learn more about mixing savory with sweets in our
multipacks. And this giving us a huge lift in our performance. We're using the Quaker
portfolio at this point, but I'm sure we can have partnerships or other ways to give
the consumer solutions with savory and sweet that will enhance the number of
occasions that our products can play. You see here a concept that we have in the US,
but we have created in Mexico, which is called Tosticentro, centro is kind of --
imagine like a food truck concept, where consumers go and they can choose
diﬀerent ingredients to create a meal with our products. So we think that there's a
very easy move from our products into meals, quick meals, convenient meals and
giving the consumer the empowerment to add ingredients, in this case, more
tomatoes and it's peppers and some other ingredients to make a meal. We call it
Tosticentros.
And I put here positive culinary. We want to move our products, as I said earlier,
more into meals, being accompaniment to a meal, but also being part of the recipe
of the meal. And more and more, we're experimenting how Lays can substitute
potatoes in many dishes around the world, how Doritos can be part of how you
make a pizza. So clearly, there is a lot of opportunities for us to move into that space
and create additional locations for our food business.
And then packaging, I won't repeat it, but we believe in powders, we believe in
tablets, we believe in concentrate that through SodaStream, each one of you can
create your preferred carbonation levels, ﬂavor levels, whatever you want, we
empower you to do it. And by the way, we save a lot of transportation, we save a lot
of plastic and we do a good thing for the world.
And the same as you look at our snacks business, we're focusing on canisters.
Canister will be an option for our consumers. You saw minis, some other options
we're taking -- we're testing in Europe. Functional packaging in some of our Quaker
products. We have heat and eat already solutions that are much more functional, or
obviously compostable and bio-degradable packaging solutions that we're testing
around the world.
Now I'll talk about pep+. We believe in pep+ being a clear area of diﬀerentiation for
us. It's not an ESG kind of concept. It is we want to put this at the center of how we
grow the company, how we create advantage with our brands, with our portfolio,
with our supply chain. And so I think when I talk to my associates, this is a passion
point of all my people. When I try to recruit people, this is a passion point for a lot of
people. I attract better people if I do that. I talk to consumers, they do -- customers,
for sure, communities, this is critical for us to continue to be welcomed in theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 10 of 16communities around the world, water conservation and some other things, especially
as you look at emerging and developing markets. So this is central to us.
Now, let's talk about a topic that is very relevant, obviously. How do we deploy
capital to capture these opportunities that I was sharing with you? Now, our priority
number one, and we've been consistent with this as we were talking to you in our
investor calls, is investing appropriately in our business. We think this business has so
much ground for growth that we need to continue to invest in capacity, digitalization,
optimization and creating new layers of advantage for our business. The second one
is very important, and we give it a lot of priority for us, is dividends. Make sure that
our investors get bigger and better dividends every year. And we have increased
now our dividends for 51 consecutive years, which is pretty powerful. We will
continue to tweak our portfolio. So as we -- that we will divest and we will invest in
new brands or opportunities that continue to put our portfolio against the high
growth spaces in our categories. And obviously, we will continue to do share
repurchases as we go along.
Now, our capital, familiar with in between 5.5% to 6% in the last four years. Few areas
of investment, clearly growth. Growth has been priority for us, manufacturing
capacity, warehousing, supply chain de-bottling go-to-market. We've been investing
a lot in IT, as I mentioned earlier, productivity, but also growth and intelligence. And
then we've been investing in sustainability. We expect our capital to be around these
levels for the next couple of years and then go down as we start already kind of
capturing the value of our investments in IT especially, and we don't have to invest
so much in the further years.
Now dividends, as I said, is priority for us to make sure that our investors keep
getting more dividend every year. We just announced a 10% dividend growth for '23.
We'll continue the journey as we go forward. And share repurchases varies
depending on the -- what is left, like basically after we made what are the priority
decisions for the business with our intention to continue to have a business that is
sustainable, that continues to win in the marketplace, grow at the top end of our
category. We continue to elevate productivity, make sure that we continue to expand
the margins in a sustainable way, make sure that there's room for investment and
room for a sustainable business performance. So we are talking about a 4% to 6%
net revenue, we're talking about 20 51 consecutive
To 30 bps of margin expansion every year and EPS of around high single-digit. I
know we've did it in the last couple of years, but we continue to think that we can
continuously deliver high single-digit every year with a dividend of about 2.5% --
2.5% to 3%, depending on the stock price. So this is the way we're thinking of our
business.
Hopefully, you guys walk away convinced that we can continue this journey. We have
a momentum. We're -- we feel strong about our brands. We feel strong about our
growth opportunities and how we're building a more capable company, how we're
building our talent, how we're building a long-term sustainability around our brands
and our business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-22

Questions And Answers
Is the mic on? Okay. Great. Let's go to Dara and we'll come around the audience.
{BIO 3017577 <GO>}
You talked about the huge growth opportunity internationally. Can you dial down a
bit more on the snacks opportunity and D&E markets, how do you develop per
capita consumption at the consumer level going forward? Maybe give us a little bit
of a review on how that development has trended over the last few years. But also, as
you think about your portfolio, you generally have the brands you need. Are you in
the product categories you need? Or might there be areas to ﬁll in from an M&A
standpoint as you look out over the next ﬁve years here?
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
I think we have a pretty good playbook on how we build the category internationally,
emerging markets. It starts with agro. In agro already, we create a big competitive
advantage. We have, I think, working class -- world-class capabilities in potato
farming and corn farming and some others. That gives us already a pillar of
advantage. We add to that the branding, we add to that the go-to-market, and we
can create pretty powerful businesses internationally.
Now the journey we've been in is kind of gaining scale across the diﬀerent markets. I
would say ﬁve years ago, we had a lot of businesses in the $100 million range. Those
businesses now are $200 million and to go into $300 million. At that point, those
businesses have a lot of scale and it can be very proﬁtable already. Now we have the
playbook, how we take Lays, Doritos, Cheetos, those three brands, across diﬀerent
age groups and portfolio.
Now in some markets, we leverage third-party products to give scale to our go-to-
market, especially in the early development stages of the business. Could that be an
opportunity? Why not? But right now, we've been able to build those businesses
with scale, proﬁtability without the need of third-party products.
Okay. Kevin?
{BIO 16423871 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Ramon, I wanted to pivot to the power of one,
and it's been a little while, I think, since we've talked about that, probably more than
a decade, I think since there's been a real push from the public markets and for
good reason because the results have been particularly good, certainly in the past
few years. Maybe just an update there on the power of one, the biggest synergies ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-22

Q - Andrea Teixeirahaving the portfolios together and whether there's still more work to be done in that
area? Thanks.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Yeah. It's a great question and one that we're, I would say, testing and learning more
and more every year. I think the consumer complementarity is becoming more and
more obvious. And as we learn -- like take the latest Super Bowl. We were able to
create combined locations and combined purchasing moments for our brands in a
way that we haven't done in the past. And customers keep coming to us, like help us
create those bundles that increase the basket size and increase the purchase
incident. So that is clear.
Now we're in developing emerging markets, we have proven the go-to-market scale
as well. right. So there, if you think about warehousing, if you think about go-to-
market, logistics and channel advantage, we put in the portfolio together, gives us
scale that other companies don't have. So that's clear. In developing markets, large
scale like the US, less obvious how you capture the value of a combined go-to-
market, especially on the logistics side. But we can capture a lot of value on the
selling side.
So if you take any channel, putting our two businesses together as a selling unit to
the retailer makes a lot of sense. We have that with all the top retailers in the US. That
gives us a tremendous advantage in terms of moving our conversations from very
tactical to super strategic. We are number one supplier to most of the retailers in the
US. That gives us a seat at the table in terms of sharing data, joining infrastructure,
talking ﬁve years out versus just next quarter. So that is proven.
Now we're testing and learning in smaller format what is the value that we can create
by combining selling of the two organizations, the same in foodservice, the same in
e-commerce, the same in direct-to-consumer. And we have pretty good learnings
that I think give us a lot of optimism how we can, on the selling side, combine the
two businesses. Logistically, it's complex in the US, even the velocity and the scale of
the business. Obviously, the G&A and everything else, there's obviously a lot of
synergies, right, IT systems or back oﬃce, et cetera. Yeah.
Okay. Andrea. Thank you. And then, well, go-around.
{BIO 1941397 <GO>}
Thank you for taking my questions. Andrea Teixeira from J.P. Morgan. So I wanted to
go back to the IT investments that you showed case. In particular, I believe recently
North America, the rollout of SAP will be next year and the following year. If you can
give us an example of how we should be thinking of the other divisions that have
implemented, how is the go-to-market improve? I mean, you're obviously excellent
with your speed to market. So I was curious more how to think about it, is more like
integrating the speed to market or perhaps synergies, how we should be thinking of
the revenue synergies and the cost synergies as we go forward?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-22

Q - Robert Ottenstein
A - Ramon L. Laguarta{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Yeah. Thanks, Andrea, I'll handle that one. You have to think of SAP as sort of the
foundational piece of all those, right. It's fundamentally a transaction system. And
we're all going through the upgrade as SAP is moving to the cloud, moving to
S/4HANA. I expect if they're not talking about it, most of our peers are probably
doing the same thing because it needs to be done by the end of the decade.
Once you have that foundational system in place, it forces a couple of things.
Number one, it gives you synergy in terms of the internal G&A that you have.
Number two, what you get out of it is more harmonized data, which allows you to
build platforms and products on top of it. So some of the things that Ramon referred
to in his presentation around precision selling, being able to take granular data store
by store and get real insight as to what's happening inside that store, and
therefore,use AI and use projection tools to say, okay, this is the product assortment
we need in there. That's sort of one good example.
Another is now take that assortment, back it up into the supply chain. As you
become more predictive with what's going to happen in the store, you can produce
much more eﬃciently so you'll get revenue or inventory synergies out of that. And in
addition to that, you just have less waste because you're not scaling out as much
product. You basically keep your product more fresh and current. So that piece
works eﬀectively as well.
Beyond that, there's a whole variety of other things in terms of the way you run the
logistics network to sort of be more eﬃcient in the way you're moving product
around. So, I mean, we could go on probably for the next 20 minutes on that, but
just a couple of quick examples to sort of give you a sense for there's a ton of power
once you get the data right and SAP is the thing that forces you to get the data right.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Yes. And if you connect that to the question earlier about power of one option is
clearly as we have the two businesses in the US and all the company and the same
systems, then we can -- we have many more options on how we do power of one.
Hey, Robert, let's go to you.
{BIO 1498660 <GO>}
Robert Ottenstein, Evercore ISI. Ramon, very big picture question. As things
normalize, is this a new normal or return to the old normal? And maybe just focusing
on the US, the consumer and also retailers and how they look at the category and
suppliers? Thank you.

Page 14 of 16A - Hugh F. Johnston
Q - Bonnie Herzog
A - Hugh F. JohnstonYeah. I guess you're referring to inﬂation or just in general how consumers are
behaving? Yeah, I think there's some secular trends that I think COVID has
accelerated and maybe this new inﬂation will accelerate even more, which is people
are eating their 2,000 calories or whatever in the day in a much more unstructured
way. That continues to be the case. And as people are spending more time at home,
those calories are becoming more of a home-based unstructured. And we see more
snacking occasions during the day, and we see more cooking both happening at
home, actually more entertainment at home, so socializing at home.
So those are trends that are happening that we think will beneﬁt our categories. I
think there is a short term on inﬂation. And obviously, consumers will have to
strategize short term what they do with their more limited budgets, and we're seeing
our categories actually not being impacted so much now because people are
prioritizing food over discretionary. And within food categories like ours where
private label has less of penetration there, we're being prioritized by consumers.
People like our brands and people enjoy our products.
So -- but I think long term, and we think in our case it's going to be a couple of years,
we're going to go back to levels of inﬂation that are closer to the 2%. I don't think
we're going there this year. We think that we will continue to have higher inﬂation
this year and potentially in '24 as well.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Okay. Jim, I think we'll take our last question from Bonnie, and then we'll move to the
breakout.
{BIO 1840179 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you. You still have a goal to achieve the mid-teen margins in PBNA.
So maybe highlight a few of the building blocks or initiatives that you're going to be
implementing to accomplish this goal and maybe realistic timing. And then in the
context of that, how do you plan to balance or prioritize market share and then
proﬁtability, speciﬁcally for your CSD business? Thanks.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
I'll answer the ﬁrst and take the second. Yeah, Bonnie, not much has changed versus
what we've talked about in the past. And just as a reminder, we increased margins by
40 bps in PBNA last year and I think a roughly similar number the previous year. A
couple of factors go into that. Number one, net revenue management obviously
gives us an opportunity to enhance margins, smart packaging, getting the right
assortment in place, driving single serve, obviously, gives us a good margin uplift as
well.
On the cost side, as we're sort of digitalizing and modernizing the supply chain, S&D
has opportunity and manufacturing has some opportunity as well, and we'll get
good chunks of basis points out of the cost structure there. In addition to that, right
now, we're in the middle of SAP in North America and in particular in PBNA this year.
As those costs start to wind down, just the project cost of implementing all of that,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 15 of 16A - Ramon L. Laguarta
A - Unidentiﬁed Speakerthere's a good chunk of margin that can be added to that as well. And that's also an
enabler to shifting more work into our global business services operation, which
means we're not just going to save on the lack of IT investment costs, but we'll also
save on the people cost over time. So those are the biggest chunks. Time frame,
we've talked about '25, something like that. We're shooting for that. We'll see how
quickly we get there, but I don't think it's seven or eight years out. I think it's still a
handful of years.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
In terms of the how we're thinking about it, Bonnie, is we're tasking the business to
grow LRB share, including third-party brands. So that is the way we're measuring the
performance of our business. So we want our business to continue to improve
margin every year, I'm talking PBNA, and their share measurement is LRB including
brands like CELSIUS, for example, right. So that's how we're thinking about our
competitive performance.
So yes, CSDs are relevant. They are very relevant. There are still a very high growth.
We have obviously beautiful brands and they're pretty proﬁtable parts of the
portfolio. But we want the business to look at sports nutrition, coﬀee, energy, water
and everything else because that's where consumers are going, and we don't want
to focus so much on CSDs then we miss what is the bigger picture, where the
consumer is heading. And where we have actually much higher right to win in terms
of our market share performance, right.
So that's how you should be thinking about improving our full LRB share, including
third-party brands that we have in our tracks and then improving margins every year
with the intention that Hugh was saying, that we get to these mid-teens levels as
soon as possible. But obviously, the two are very important. Otherwise, we would be
sacriﬁcing the long term for the short term. But we don't want, we don't do that. I
mean, the company is much broader than just PBNA, and we have the luxury if you
want, of making choices and still delivering very good performance for our
shareholders on an annual basis, right.
So we're actually going to move over to the breakout room a little bit early. We have
a special presentation. I have our next session, featuring Bill Morris.
