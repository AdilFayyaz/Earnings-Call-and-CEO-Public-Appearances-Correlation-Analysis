All right. It's my theme music. We're very excited to have PepsiCo here with us today.
And Vivek Sankaran, President and Chief Operating Oﬃcer of Frito-Lay North
America. Joining Vivek is also VP of Investor Relations, Jamie Caulﬁeld. In an era
where many food and beverage companies are dealing with a host of disruptions,
Frito just powers on. So we look forward to hearing more about plans to keep up
that momentum. Vivek, I'll turn it to you.

Page 2 of 16Thank you, Bryan. Good afternoon, everyone. Let me just give you a little feel for
what we're going to do today. I'm going to take 2 or 3 minutes giving you some
context. And then maybe spend 15 minutes or so talking about the Frito-Lay
business, the Frito-Lay ﬂywheel, if I can call it that. Then, Jamie and I are here to take
questions. And we hope we can spend 15 minutes taking questions, all right?
So the safe harbor statement, please take note of it.
Let me start with just a little bit of context here. In 2017, Frito-Lay contributed 1/4 of
PepsiCo's total net revenues and 42% of its operating proﬁt. This was consistent with
our contribution in 2016. And we are pleased to play a role. And a big role, in driving
PepsiCo's growth and proﬁtability.
I would say Frito-Lay is in a good place. We have a great portfolio of brands, great
relationships with consumers and customers, an incredibly eﬀective supply chain
and DSD workforce and robust cost management. We have delivered what we
believe are top-tier results in our industry. On average, over the past three years,
we've delivered 3% net revenue growth, 6% proﬁt growth and have been the #1
dollar growth contributor to the food and beverage market. In fact, our growth
contribution has exceeded all our competitors combined over the same period. We
continue to gain market share -- it's a big focus for us. And gained 37 basis points of
macro snacks share in 2017 versus the prior year, in the total macro snacks segment
of about $100 billion.
We are also proud of the fact that in the latest Kantar Retail PoweRanking study, our
retail partners voted PepsiCo at the top of the manufacturer list for the second
straight year. Our ability to leverage the scale and breadth of our North American
business has been pivotal in driving this success. And please note that there are a
number of categories on the right, where we were ranked #1.
I'll give you a few examples of how we at PepsiCo bring to life -- bring this to life with
retail partners. First, through our demand accelerator, which we formed in 2015. We
provide a singular PepsiCo approach to shopper insights, shopper marketing,
combining data across categories to drive total basket size and penetration.
Second, through our PepsiCo customer teams, we manage relationships with our
largest customers across all our categories to oﬀer a seamless approach to working
with us.
And third, we actively cross-promote products to create Better Together consumer
solutions. Our most recent example was the successful launch of Doritos Blaze and
Dew Ice at Super Bowl, 2 products designed from the ground up to complement
each other.
Our customers value the capabilities we've assembled over the last few years across
many fronts: consumer insights, digital marketing, supply chain and e-commerce, to
just name a few.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-21
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 16Our momentum is very strong. Over the last three years, we've gained 48 basis
points of share in the salty category while delivering 30 consecutive periods of share
gain in savory. This has been fueled by a strong and broad portfolio of core brands
and products as well as some fabulous innovation. My favorite on this page on the
top left there is Poppables. We worked on that for three years to get it just right. It's a
3D-shaped chip. It's light and airy in texture. And in essence, it extends the eating
enjoyment for the same amount of calories. But that is a lot of our core innovation
that you see on that page. When I talk about the Frito ﬂywheel earlier, it's pretty
straightforward. You've seen this before. This is not a new framework. We just get
better at each of these 4. And we connect each of these 4: brand building,
innovation, execution and productivity. And I'll just talk to -- spend some time on
each of these 4.
Brands. We have some of the most recognized brands in the world, including
Doritos, Cheetos and Lay's. In fact, the top 7 brands in salty are Frito-Lay brands. And
we generate almost 90% of our total revenue from brands with either the #1 or #2
market share positions in their respective subcategories.
We also have a phenomenal marketing team that is consistently creating new and
innovative ways to connect with our customers and our consumers and keep them
engaged with iconic advertising campaigns. We're going to take a look at a Super
Bowl spot in just a minute, where you've got a chance to see Peter Dinklage and
Morgan Freeman battle it out, okay? Beyond just being creative, this was the ﬁrst
commercial with 2 big brands, back-to-back in a 60-second spot. And you should
know that 2 -- and the way this works for us, 2 weeks before the launch, we started
sending out digital -- we started digital campaign with teaser ads. It ﬁrst showed
Peter and Morgan in diﬀerent -- in a duel or at least connecting like you saw earlier.
Then we introduced the musicians.
And what's very important is that we tied all of this to what -- to in-store execution
and what we call just seamless media-to-shelf execution. Can you play the Doritos
Blaze commercial, please?
(presentation)
What do you think? All right, all right. Another thing I want to highlight is we're just
launching, as we speak, what we call the Lay's Smile campaign. This is, in addition to
just getting consumers to ﬁnd their own smile. And so these bags are going to have
various smiles. It's a program that started out in Asia. And that's rolled around
diﬀerent parts of the world with us. Each of the -- we're also going to -- they're going
to donate to Operation Smile with each purchase. So this program is just launching.
Another very, very creative program on a core brand to continue to create
excitement in the category and to continue to get placement in our retail stores.
The next piece I'll talk about is our innovation. We continue to invigorate our core
brands with new and exciting forms and ﬂavors. I mentioned Lay's Poppables earlier.
But we have other great examples. On the left on the top, you see Cheetos Paws,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-21
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 4 of 16which just brings the mischievous nature of Cheetos, the brand positioning of
Cheetos, to new fun forms.
Beyond ﬂavor and form, we are innovating across categories. For example, we
extended the bold ﬂavor and crunch of Doritos into the nuts category with the
launch of Doritos Crunch Nuts. You see that at the bottom in that tall bag there,
Doritos Crunch Nuts. These are roasted peanuts wrapped in crunchy Doritos nacho
cheese or cool ranch ﬂavored shells. And they are ﬂavorful but also convenient.
And for the launch, we introduced and developed a new packaging, which got the
iconic triangular shape of Doritos. But more importantly, it's sturdy. It's something
that's convenient for you to just eat while you're driving or something. But also can
be closed and resealed and put in your backpack, right? And we see platforms like
this coming along that provide diﬀerent functionality through packaging.
Finally, we're also launching entire new brands. For example, you can expect to see
later this year a brand called Red Rock Deli. It's the product on the right, the red and
the blue bag, red curry, coconut, tamale and pink salt. Red Rock is a brand we are
importing from our Australia business. It's been a big hit in Australia. It's probably
the best potato chip ever made with an amazing crunch and artisanal ﬂavors. And it's
made in what we call a continuous kettle process, something we are bringing for the
ﬁrst time into the U.S. We expect this one to be a big hit, too.
I mentioned earlier the notion of media to shelf. And I want to give you an example
of how this plays out with our innovation and plays out with our DSD system in
diﬀerent ways. On the one end, for a large brand like Doritos Blaze, we went broad
and fast and achieved 95% ACV within 3 weeks of the launch before Super Bowl.
And in contrast, when it comes to a brand like Red Rock Deli, you're going to see an
extremely targeted launch. We are targeting speciﬁc markets and even speciﬁc
stores based on our understanding of the target consumer and where they shop. So
it's DSD system that can go from -- go to an extreme scale or be extremely targeted.
We're also growing our Better For You portfolio. And for example, Smartfood, the
products you see on the top there. It's the #1 ready-to-eat popcorn brand in the
country and has posted double-digit growth for 3 straight years. Consumers we
know continue to seek (inaudible) packs that have clean credentials, including USDA
Organic, non-GMO and no artiﬁcials.
Our Simply portfolio capitalizes on this trend by providing consumers with the
brands their families love and the credentials they're looking for. Not surprisingly,
Simply has been a top performer over the last few years. And we see it as a major
growth driver. Simply is the bag on the bottom, the second from the left, the Simply
Cheetos.
We also launched a brand called Oﬀ the Eaten Path. We incubated this brand over
many years and then launched it in Q1 2017 in retail and in e-commerce. Oﬀ the
Eaten Path delivers uncompromised nutrition. All products in the portfolio are madeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-21
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 5 of 16with real vegetables, no artiﬁcial ﬂavors, no preservatives and are non-GMO. The
current portfolio consists of pop veggie crisps, hummus crisps and sweet potato
crisps. And we have a robust pipeline of future innovation behind this brand. And we
expect this to be another strong growth driver for us.
Finally, we retained our commitment to transform our portfolio. On the right of the
page, you see our commitments that we made publicly to reduce sodium, reducing
sat fat, increasing positive nutrition. Over the last decade, we've removed 12,000
tons of saturated fat, removing highly unhealthy oils, taken 409 tons of sodium out of
our portfolio and increased the number of products we have that oﬀer positive
nutrition, like Oﬀ the Eaten Path and SunChips Veggie Harvest.
The third priority is execution. The heart and soul of Frito-Lay's is our world-class
sales frontline organization, nearly 20,000 of us who make over 500,000 service
calls and reach nearly 300,000 retail stores every week. While the scale of our
system is obvious, it is the reach, consistent quality of service, the precision of
assortments, the synchronization with our marketing programs, the often tailored
retail theater that you see in stores and the positive impact to the retailer's P&L and
cash ﬂow that makes the ultimate diﬀerence.
Despite our capabilities today, we believe we have another S-curve of performance
with advances in technology in DSD. With the data we are collecting and that digital
capabilities we are enabling for the frontline, we believe we can further improve how
we plan our business, segment customers and stores and integrate in-store and
online, enable on-device activation so that our consumers can ﬁnd the right Frito-Lay
product at the right time in the right store.
For example, we are vastly improving our ordering algorithms to automatically
generate the perfect order for that store based on sales histories, counter trends and
inventories. We are investing in closed loop technologies that allow managers to
assign speciﬁc tasks and close the loop on timeliness and quality of execution. We
are deploying new label models that allow for more specialization of tasks yet to
ensure integration across those tasks, further improving execution and reducing
costs.
Now a word on emerging channels. We can't do this without talking about e-
commerce. We know that consumer habits are changing, the retail landscape is
changing. And we are dedicated to -- dedicated accelerating our growth beyond our
traditional retail. In our away-from-home business, we have developed a unique
portfolio for K-12 schools, which includes products that have whole grains, are
gluten-free and reduced fat. We've also introduced a healthy vending solution called
Hello Goodness, which can be placed in schools or oﬃces and leverages the total of
PepsiCo Better For You portfolio, ranging from oven-baked Lay's and Sabra hummus
to Quaker bars and Naked Juice.
Now let me turn to e-commerce. We as PepsiCo have about $1 billion business in
annualized retail sales globally. And we are growing faster than the category. WeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-21
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 16started investing in this channel three years ago by bringing in talent from the
outside. I want you to think tech company like talent. And putting our best and
brightest with them and giving them the support as a leadership to break all internal
rules they need to so that they can go fast and be agile.
Our business is robust with both our brick-and-mortar e-commerce partners and
with our pure-play partners. Though as you know, that line is blurring fast. We do the
basics well such as search, content, digital marketing, tweaking our supply chain to
sell our everyday portfolio on this channel, things you saw earlier. But we're also
pushing the envelope in many ways.
We have been most pleased about how e-commerce has helped our overall brand
building. This is true with our co-brands, where we've been able to do programs with
brands like Cheetos. Chester on the Dresser is something you see on the right.
Those are part of our marketing campaigns. We sell them on e-commerce channels.
It's opening up new doors like that for us.
Speciﬁc to Frito-Lay, e-commerce has been especially relevant for our Better For You
portfolio, several of them over-indexed online and have high subscription rates.
We've also leveraged e-commerce to drive into new spaces, new occasions. As an
example, early in our e-commerce journey, one of our insights was that folks were
using e-commerce to send care packages to college students, military personnel
and as fuel for road trips, long road trips. Using that insight, the team developed a
set of packages that comprised of assorted Frito-Lay brands, Lay's, Doritos, Funyuns,
nuts, cookies, et cetera. They did this from initial idea to the ﬁrst shopper delivery
within 30 days, which speaks again to the notion of breaking rules so that we can act
fast. Anyway, these snack packs, as we call them, have become some of our best
sellers online.
The other thing that we've proven time and again here is that our portfolio breadth
really works. Shoppers are looking for solutions and the ability to provide
convenient, relevant solutions, like the one highlighted here on this page, has really
struck a chord, both in e-grocery and in our pure-play e-commerce businesses.
Using data and analytics, we have also been able to highlight relevant and
contextual aﬃnities online. So if someone buys a Sabra hummus online, suggesting
that they add Stacy's Pita Chips to that order has been eﬀective. If you think about it,
the friction of having to walk to another part of the aisle -- store and search for an
aﬃnity product is completely gone in commerce. And that's working to our
advantage. Net-net, we're very pleased with our e-commerce and Frito-Lay, in
particular. We doubled the business last year. We'll double it again this year.
Productivity is a very important pillar. This is what funds everything else we do. It
continues to be robust across 4 diﬀerent planks. Within our supply chain, we
continue to reap the beneﬁts of our GES expansion. We've been talking about GES
for a while. It continues to provide us unlock more SKU capacity for us and continuesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-21
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 7 of 16A - Jamie Caulﬁeld
Q - Laurent D. Grandetto allow us to increase our breadth of portfolio. This has generated cost savings, too,
that reinforces and funds the growth in our system.
Expanded SKU capacity will also help oﬀer the right customized portfolio in every
market, especially in diverse urban markets, ultimately in every store.
We're also accelerating our automation agenda across the entire value chain. For
example, we have installed robotic truck loaders and automated picking for
individual small bags, eaches, in some of our facilities to allow fully automated mixed
cases for delivery to small-format stores. This is something we never thought
possible ﬁve years ago. Technology advances. And now we can pick eaches with
robots.
At the same time, we're investing in digital capabilities for our frontline to enable
better execution of custom assortment and displays at a very granular store level. We
have an app called Store Facts on Demand. We can walk into a store and see
immediately detailed trends at the outlet level and the store level for pack, ﬂavor or
brand, all of it, which is updated daily. And as many others are doing, we are also
pushing for automation in all of the back-oﬃce tasks that we have.
We also reap beneﬁts from the sustainability agenda. This not only delivers beneﬁts
for our planet and will reduce energy and waste. But also generates additional cost
savings for the entire organization.
These 4 planks of productivity continue to yield for us. And technology allows us to
continue to push the state-of-the-art in each of these 4.
So let me just close by coming back to our model. These 4 things that I've talked
about, we've talked about before, continue to produce for us. We continue to be
conﬁdent that our growth model will deliver and that in 2018, our customers,
consumers and shareholders will be as pleased with Frito-Lay as they have been in
the past.
Thank you very much. And we'll take questions from any of you. Jamie?
Questions And Answers
{BIO 17051951 <GO>}
Let's start with Laurent.
{BIO 19930531 <GO>}
I'd like to (inaudible) Frito-Lay has been delivering, I mean, more than 3% in organic
growth for the last few years. I mean, now you're well above, I mean, 31% EBIT
margin. So -- and the beverage business needs you and needs your number. So isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-21

Page 8 of 16A - Vivek Sankaran
A - Jamie Caulﬁeld
Q - Dara Warren Mohsenian
A - Vivek Sankaranthat sustainable? I mean, how long do see, I mean, Frito-Lay, I mean, continue to
grow that fast and with that level of margin?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
So we've averaged about 3% over the last three years. And that 3%, we think, is very
sustainable. There is an inherent growth in the marketplace for the population. And
that population supports snacks. So there's a fundamental volume growth in the
business. With strong innovation, I think innovation is essential. With strong
innovation and smart price -- package mixes, you get an additional pricing on top of
that, which is what that 3% is. And so we continue to see that. And as long as we can
keep this category vibrant with the innovation and marketing that you see, we feel
comfortable with that growth trajectory.
{BIO 17051951 <GO>}
So Dara?
{BIO 3017577 <GO>}
So just following up on the margin side, obviously, your level of margins at 31% here
is sort of the envy of almost all the CPG companies here today. So as you look going
forward, can you talk a little bit about what the key building blocks are that drive
further margin expansion, how high a level do you think you can get to? Or are you
getting to a point where you're reaching sort of the ceiling on the margins? And
there's been some investor concern recently that you've needed to sort of lean on
Frito-Lay North America proﬁt, given some of the beverage weakness. So can you
talk a little bit about the level of investment behind the business over the last few
quarters also?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
Okay. So ﬁrst on the margin point, I'll tell you how we think about it, Dara. We are --
there are 2 things we are maniacally focused on, right, which I think are enduring.
One is you always want to focus on ﬁnding a way to get better price per pound. And
that comes based on innovation, excitement with the category. In our category,
you're also ﬁnding people going for smaller bag sizes. And so the mix helps on that
front, too. So better price per pound. The other thing we maniacally focus on is cost
per pound, right? And every year, if you look out ﬁve years ago, you go, Boy, there's
going to be a limit to that. But every so many years, technologies come around. And
I'll give you this example. And I talked about eaches picking. We have people going
up and down a bay, picking a bag of Lay's and a bag of Doritos and a bag of
Smartfood, putting it in a box and ﬁlling up that box because one particular c-store
needed a particular assortment. Rather than sending cases, we pick eaches. That was
manual labor. Now we ﬁgured out a way to automate that with a robot, okay? We
didn't imagine that ﬁve years ago. So technology always keeps giving you new
avenues to get that kind of productivity and cost per margin -- cost per pound. And
as long as we can keep these 2 engines going, the notion of expansion continues.
Now I recognize it cannot go on forever. But as of now, we continue to see
opportunities on both of those fronts. And we're not -- to your other point, no, FritoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-21

much because of pressure or lack of pressure from another business.
{BIO 17051951 <GO>}
Brett. We'll just come across upon here and I'll get to the next row.
{BIO 17398526 <GO>}
As we sit back and hear all the companies here talk about categories that used to be
healthy, that used to deliver growth and no longer there, how do guys stay in front of
the curve in terms of making sure that your portfolio meets where the consumer is
going to be in ﬁve years so that you're not one playing from behind? Then just what
are your thoughts -- as center store continues to decelerate, we're seeing more and
more people wanting into get to the snacks business.
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
Can you say that part again?
{BIO 17398526 <GO>}
As the center store decelerates, more and more food companies are getting into
snacks because that's where the growth is, either organic innovation or M&A. So
what's your view on that and your ability to stay competitive?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
Yes, okay. Just remind me what your ﬁrst question was, the ﬁrst part of it? Sorry, Brett.
{BIO 17398526 <GO>}
So the ﬁrst question was just on how do you guys stay in front of the consumer -- stay
in front of the curve?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
Got it, got it. Yes. Look, we are -- wow, I've been at Frito since 2011. And about 2011,
we started focusing maniacally on consumers, okay. And what consumers care for.
And one of the decisions we made is rather than predict where consumers are going
to go, we're going to give consumers choice. And so you can go to a store today
and you can get an organic Dorito and you can get a regular Dorito and you can get
a Doritos Blaze, if you want, right? We started -- we give consumers choice. And
when you give consumers choice, you start seeing which ones resonate. And so we
are always thinking -- and our portfolio is always two years ahead. So early last year,
we knew what we're launching in 2019. So we try to stay ahead and just keep giving
consumers choice. And rather than trying to predict, rather than trying to hold
ourselves in one area or another. And second, with others trying to get into snacks, I
hope all of you see that as a very positive thing for the category we're at, okay, that
others want to put money into this category. And I think it will be good for the
consumer. I think it will just make us even better competitors. So I think it's a good
thing for the category.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-21

Right. So maybe just a related question to that. One of the -- one good thing that's
been consistent about the food companies that are now kind of getting into this
snacks business is they feel they're going to bring capabilities to the snack world that
maybe these existing businesses didn't have. So as you think about Campbell's it's
going to have a big snack business now. Hershey's is ramping into savory snacks.
Kellogg, right, has talked about being a snacking company. How do you sort of
evaluate the competition now and maybe what are potential competitor threats? Do
you do any sort of internal, sort of looking at how the competitors are changing and
how you might have to adapt to that?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
Bryan (sic) (Brett), we are always looking at the competitive environment. We're
always looking at how that might change, how -- what diﬀerent alternatives others
might take and paths they may take. But the one thing that we are -- we have got
better and better at is reacting, right? So if you go back 7, eight years, people used
to use this notion of ankle biters, right. And there were a lot of snacks coming in that
would take away pieces of share. And that was, I think, a bit of a wake-up call for us.
And so now we've become much smarter at seeing what's happening in the
marketplace, reacting very quickly. But also being smart that some of these things
are just fads. They come and go. Knowing which ones are sticking and which ones
are not sticking and then reacting very quickly. Popcorn would be one such an
example, if you display the math over several years. So that's how we play. We --
again, we are -- our philosophy is, we don't -- we can't predict everything. But we can
prepare for everything. And that's what we do.
{BIO 17051951 <GO>}
Okay. Ali?
{BIO 15328592 <GO>}
So 2 questions. One is just back on just margin. So I understand that you think that
it's good for the category that others are coming into it. But you have a very kind of
juicy margin target for others to get to. And actually, they're all either acquiring
things or investing in the category. So I guess, I'm surprised that you're not a little bit
more concerned that everybody has seen snacking as an opportunity and they're
now aggressively going after it with your margins being so high. So that's the ﬁrst
question. I'll come back with the second one.
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
I'm sorry if you're reading that I'm not concerned. Of course, I'm concerned when
others get into the marketplace. But we've competed with all of these players
before. So nobody here is new, right? We have a good sense for how to play in this
market. We have a good sense for the things that people do when they get into the
business early. We often ﬁnd that those things are not sustainable, right? And we
continue to focus on 2 things. We know -- we think we know more than anybody
what goes through a consumer's mind when they think about snacks. We try to stayFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-21

Q - Lauren Rae Liebermanahead on innovation. We try to stay ahead on execution. And all of those, we still
have a lot of others things that we haven't yet brought to the market, right, in terms
of capabilities. That's why I mentioned I think we have another S-curve of
performance left. And we'll just have to see.
{BIO 15328592 <GO>}
Then the other one is on NAV. So I guess, (inaudible) not a lot of representation for
NAV for some reason. But on the last conference call, Hugh made a point around the
pricing discussion that, gosh, Pepsi beverage just isn't selling as much as we like on
regular price and really selling a lot of velocity on promo, not that we're promoting
more. It's just a lot more is sold on promo than is sold on regular. And that has gone
a lot of play in the industry. So a lot of people are asking, "Gosh, that's worrisome,
what does that mean?" How do you know that the incremental investment you're
making and the investment that you're increasing going forward is going to be
enough to ﬁx that or at least improve that challenge that the brand is facing, right?
We're not selling stuﬀ on regular price and we're only selling on promo. But that
suggests that there's brand damage that has been done.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Fair enough. So this goes back to the comments we made in Q3. And when it comes
to a few of the key core brands, Pepsi, DEW, to a lesser extent, Gatorade have its own
issues in the Third Quarter. We allocated M&A -- or not the M&A, A&M away from
those brands into some of these next-generation brands. And basically think of it as
just our relative share of voice versus our key competitors. It went down a lot. We
know what the brands do when we're closer to parity on the share of voice when it
comes to media. And so that's the gap we're trying to close. Now there's no
guarantee that ﬁxes it. But we have plenty of past experience that in looking at these
metrics, that it does tend to improve brand health and then that it translates to better
full revenue performance in the market.

So you're talking about you've been at Fritos since 2011, right? And since that time,
you (made) what is consumer choice, let's give them choice, let's give them choice.
But the challenge to that, of course, is how do you give them choice but still invest in
your big core brands while you do small, right? So you've done an increasingly good
job of doing that. And even with today, you mentioned the nuanced strategy of
diﬀerent distribution model for small brands versus big Doritos, like the spicy hot
thing, whatever it's called.

A - Jamie CaulﬁeldIt's really not targeted for me. But I was just curious, one, in how much of that was
really a conscious decision over the last 6 or seven years to ﬁgure out how you
allocate those investment dollars across big, small, new line extension? And to what
degree can that sort of deleverage internally across other parts of the business, for
instance, the North America Beverages, to maybe do a little bit of a better job
balancing that mix of provide choice but not sacriﬁce investment in the big core?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
Yes, I think the key word is patience. And remember, in our brand portfolio, we have
2 types of brands. We have 2 types of choices for consumers when we go into the
Better For You world. One is the core brand carries the name but provides a Better
For You alternative. So it is, say, organic Tostitos. So you go to the nature's market
section of a store. You will ﬁnd a portfolio of our Simply line with brands that are
familiar to you but that provide a diﬀerent set of ingredients, okay? Then, there are
the other ones that are brands like Oﬀ the Eaten Path that we're introducing or Red
Rock Deli that we're introducing. What we have learned to do there is to be surgical
and patient, right? We don't expect that Oﬀ the Eaten Path is going to be a big, big
number any time soon. But we know that it's powerful enough that we can build it
over time. So that's the way we're playing it. And a lot of -- and in some cases, we're
using the DSD system. In some cases, we're not using it. Red Rock Deli, we use the
DSD system. In other cases, we won't use the DSD system. We're playing that also
carefully so that we don't stress any part of our system down as we go forward, right?
And look, we're continuing to learn that in North America. We learned to play that
game steadily and patiently in North America.
{BIO 4832525 <GO>}
And can you help your partners in beverages in learning that?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
We're always working together in North America.
{BIO 17051951 <GO>}
I want to go to Caroline and Vivien and then we'll go back to Nik.
{BIO 22683565 <GO>}
I'm also going to ask about beverages. Because it's just -- it's a little confusing as to
how you can have a spectacular 30-plus years of growth top line, margin expansion
at Frito, all the great productivity work you're doing, which you lay out very, very
clearly in the (pre-pack) and the improvement. And you're not at a granular level
seeing anything. So it seems like they're 2 diﬀerent companies completely. Is there
something structural in beverages? Is it because Coke has a dominant share? Is it the
nature of the product? What is it that makes it so much harder to win deﬁnitively in
beverages on a consistent basis the way you have in snacks?

A - Vivek SankaranI'm going to go back to Vivek's slide that shows that we have the 7 top brands in
salty snacks. When you have the 7 top brands in salty snacks, it's a diﬀerent game.
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
But Caroline, you go back. Frito has had its moments, too, tough days too, right? It's
not always been that. We've gone through our cycle. Just go back 10, 15 years. We've
gone through that cycle, too. I just think that's a combination of those brands, the
steadiness and the execution. And there's -- so I think it's going through a phase
where it's been a little better.
{BIO 22683565 <GO>}
And just to push it a little bit further, though, is it more dependent on a handful of
very big brands -- Pepsi Diet Pepsi? Is that the problem whereas you've got so many
SKUs? Is that part of the issue in snacks? Flexibility you have in snacks?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
What I can tell you in Frito, too, is that if we lose momentum on the core brand, it's
diﬃcult to make the numbers work. And the same issue holds. The same issue holds.
The core brands have to work for the math to work at Frito, too.
{BIO 16513330 <GO>}
To follow up on that theme, it seems like that your innovation plan for 2018 are
perhaps are little bit more weighted to Better For You than we have seen historically.
Giving Pepsi full credit, you guys have been way ahead of the curve on Better For
You across your portfolio. But it does raise a question about the Third Quarter
misstep on beverages, where my understanding was there was a little bit too much
emphasis on low, no cal in beverages, where the consumer was still more inclined to
full calorie. So as you put up together your launch plan on salty snacks with a lot of
new innovation on Better For You, what did you learn from what happened in NAV in
the Third Quarter and how does that inform kind of the balance of emphasis across
your portfolio?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
With the DSD system, one of the -- one of the powerful things about the DSD system,
as I told you, we can get to 95 ACV with the Doritos Blaze in 3 weeks. One of the
powerful things about the DSD system is if I emphasize something else, we have 95
ACV on Simply, okay? And so we've just got to be really careful about what we
emphasize with that frontline and make sure that we are always building what I'd call
the new things around the core portfolio and the perimeter. So that's why you see us
launching the Lay's Smile campaign, right, as a big prominent engine. That's why you
see us launching Doritos Blaze. But you won't see a big commercial like that on Oﬀ
the Eaten Path or on Simply. You will ﬁnd placement of Simply and oﬀ the Eaten Path
that complements it. What we're trying to do there is either attract a diﬀerent
shopper or expand the basket with something. And that's -- that's part of the trick
with the DSD system.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-21

On an un-what, sorry?
{BIO 16513330 <GO>}
On an unpromoted basis post-launch, how should we think about price gaps on
your core versus your Simply line extension?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
It's about 20% to 30% higher on the Simply lines, yes.
{BIO 17051951 <GO>}
Nik?
{BIO 7557463 <GO>}
Vivek, maybe you can help us. When you think longer term about the DSD system
and the rising emergence of click-and-collect and e-commerce, how do you think
about that, just the kind of polarizing? Because obviously, DSD is a very expensive
network to run, (importance) of spot merchandising. But obviously, we're going into
an environment where consumers aren't even walking into the store.
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
Yes, Nik. I always thought of it as a very proﬁtable system to run, okay? Yes.
{BIO 7557463 <GO>}
True.
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
It's true. So these are early days. And one of the things that we are observing, ﬁrst,
you have to take e-commerce and parse it out into 2 types. One is there's the e-
commerce, which is fulﬁlled from a store, okay? Then there's the e-commerce that is
shipped from a location. The ﬁrst thing about our system is recognize that our
product fundamentally doesn't transport well. And because of that, we designed a
big network where we have plants closest to consumption. So our product is already
closer to the home, ﬁrst thing you should note, right? And so when it comes to
something that's picked up from a store, it is the DSD system that is still enabling the
transaction closest to the store. On the part -- on those parts of the business where
you have something going from a DC, from some dot-com or from a dot-com
provider going from a DC, a DSD system is not as valuable. But that today is. And in
our forecast, still a smaller chunk of the total business. I suspect what's going toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-21

Q - Eunjoo Honghappen is you're going to have an integrated system, where people are picking up
from store, delivering from there. And that network is going to combine. So we still
see a lot of promise. And recognize that a huge part of our DSD system's advantage
is to reach those stores that you and I don't talk about. You don't see it in a report. It's
up and down the street. It's a liquor store. It's a gas station that's owned by an
independent. And that's where we make more of our money.
{BIO 17051951 <GO>}
We'll take 2 very quick. So (Amit) and Judy.
Vivek, just a quick question on e-commerce and another one. Is your share
advantage just as large in e-commerce as it is in the brick-and-mortars? Then the
second one, you answered all the tough questions very well. So in your words, what
are some of the things that keep you up at night? Is there anything to worry about
this business at this time?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
Of course. Yes, of course. Well let me answer that ﬁrst. Yes. We worry about the
whole change in the retail environment, clearly. We worry about potential continued
deﬂation in the retail environment, which is why this notion of innovation, price mix,
all of those become so important to ensure you can get the pricing in this retail
environment. We worry about -- as much as I seem to have conveyed that I'm not
concerned, we worry about others getting into our category, right? And we want to
be watchful. And so those are some of the things. I would have said some years ago
that I'm worried about the health and wellness. But I think we have made
tremendous progress. So I feel like we have learned how to play that game and
we've learned how to provide consumers with a choice on a variety of that portfolio.
And you had an e-commerce question, too?
Yes. Your relative share advantage so far.
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
Yes. The relative share advantage. Let me put it this way. It is clearly -- we're surprised
how strong the basket is. The basket tends to be equal to or better when there's a
transaction online in the brick-and-mortar e-tailer space, okay? And the other one, in
the pure-plays, it varies by category. There are some categories -- or product types
where it is signiﬁcantly -- I know some of that is lower. But we're happy about the
ones where it's higher.

Q - Bryan Douglass Spillane
A - Vivek Sankaran
A - Jamie CaulﬁeldSo I guess, my question is just around your desire to maybe expand your portfolio
more broadly to some of the adjacent snacking categories. I know in the past, you
talked about chocolate-covered ruﬄes and really using core brands to go into
adjacent categories. Is that still the strategy? Do you have to develop more new
brands? Can you deploy more of a venture capital model to take investments in
some of the smaller start-ups that are really popping up here and there?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
Judy, we're doing all of that. So we are looking at -- as Indra said in the call, we are
always looking at potential tuck-ins that can expand our portfolio. We are so strong
on -- if you think of 2 bases, the potato chip and the corn, we're so strong. So we're
always looking at ways of getting into other snacks. When you think of chocolate-
covered Lay's, that's more of a novelty, okay? That's nice around Christmas but not
something that you're going to consume enough often. So we're trying to get into
things that can provide other beneﬁts. So this Oﬀ the Eaten Path, the fundamental --
that for us is going to be a platform where we can bring other beneﬁts to you, the
snacks that are -- that might provide you a wonderful eating experience and some
protein, as an example. You'll see more of that coming later this year and next year.
