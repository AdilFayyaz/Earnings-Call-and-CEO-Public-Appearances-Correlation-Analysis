(Audio-Video Presentation) Hi, I'm Mellody Hobson, Chairman of the Board of
Starbucks. And I'm delighted to welcome you to our 2022 Annual Meeting. Today,
on behalf of the Board of Directors, I'd like to discuss some leadership changes that
will unfold in the coming weeks and months.
Succession is always at the top of any board's agenda and the board has been
working to advance our planning since our CEO, Kevin Johnson signaled to us early
last year that he was starting to think about his future and possible retirement. After
steering Starbucks through the diﬃcult pandemic years, Kevin felt the waning of the
global health crisis might be the appropriate bookend to his many years of service,
that day has now come.
A working committee of the board was formed to oversee the search process aided
by Russell Reynolds Associates. The process is ongoing and yielding a strong slate of
potential candidates and we anticipate having the seat ﬁlled by fall.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-16

Page 2 of 29As we take the time needed to select the right future leader, the board has asked
Starbucks founder Howard Schultz to return his Interim CEO starting April 4th, he will
also rejoin the board. On behalf of the entire company, I want to thank Kevin for his
leadership as CEO over the past ﬁve years as well as his prior eight years of service,
ﬁrst as a Board Member and then as President and COO. Kevin and our talented
executive team navigated one of the most diﬃcult periods in modern history. As
many know, we have partners not employees, and the economic certainty provided
to our partners during the early months of the COVID shutdown as well as during
mandatory quarantines upheld our core values and will be an enduring legacy.
During his tenure, Kevin expanded the company's reach through the Global Coﬀee
Alliance with Nestle, which now operates in nearly 80 markets. He also devised and
executed the growth at scale agenda. Both signiﬁcantly increased shareholder value.
Our digital platform is now a key driver of our customer interactions around the
globe. Kevin also established the people positive, planet positive, and proﬁt positive
framework. This initiative is a never-ending eﬀort to create a better world for
Starbucks partners, farmers, customers, and the communities we serve. Kevin will
remain a Starbucks partner and special consultant to the board through September
and we sincerely appreciate his eﬀorts on behalf of all of our stakeholders. You'll
hear more from him in a minute.
In the near term, the board believes Howard Schultz is singularly qualiﬁed to serve as
Interim CEO. In addition to the day-to-day management of the company, Howard will
participate in the CEO search process and help onboard the next leader. Howard is
volunteering his time as renowned CEO, and will receive $1 of compensation.
Howard's love of Starbucks is legendary. We are delighted he answered the board's
call.
As founder, Howard redeﬁned the role and responsibility of a publicly held company
pioneering programs like comprehensive healthcare, stock ownership, and free
college tuition for full and part-time employees. During his years at the company,
Starbucks grew from 11 to more than 28,000 stores in 77 countries and its stock price
surged 21,000% from the time of its 1992 IPO until his retirement in 2018. Howard's
return at this inﬂection point in the world and our own company's history is not back
to the past, but back to the future. As we pilot the aftermath of the pandemic and the
socioeconomic forces impacting the lives of all of our stakeholders, who better to
reinforce our culture than its creator? His eﬀorts will underscore our commitment to
innovating and executing on our core purpose to inspire and nurture the human
spirit one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.
I also want to directly address the matter of unionization. The power of Starbucks
historically has been to learn from every conversation and concern at every level of
the company. We hear the feedback and we are committed to ﬁnding new ways to
enhance and elevate what we call the partner experience. And we truly believe the
company has and can continue to deliver far more in direct partnership with our
people. This company never stands still. The Starbucks of the future will continue in
its tradition of blazing new trails, honing our craft, and learning from our mistakes.
Starbucks has always been a people-focused company guided by our belief thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-16

Page 3 of 29Kevin R. Johnsonwhen we invest in our partners, they create the experience that uplifts our customers,
that will not change. On a personal note, this is my ﬁrst time addressing you as Board
Chair and I'd like to take a moment to express my deep belief in this company's
mission.
Today, demand for Starbucks is strong and growing. Our great coﬀee remains
foundational to so many narratives from ﬁrst dates and job interviews to study
sessions and that much needed break. I strongly believe the relationships built over
our coﬀee make our world better. Although I realize the world is fragile and I'm
acutely aware of the pain all around, I'm proud to know, day in and day out,
Starbucks and our green apron partners are connecting people at a time when we
need it most. Thank you.

Well, thank you, Melody, and welcome to all of you who have joined us for today's
meeting. This is my 14th Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Starbucks has been a gift
in my life and today, in fact, every day, I want to make this about our partners. It is
about all of us and that is why I want to kick oﬀ the ﬁrst part of todays meeting by
recognizing and celebrating Starbucks partners. Keep in mind that all Starbucks
partners are shareholders through our Bean Stock Program, and more importantly,
partners are the heartbeat of Starbucks. Throughout my Starbucks journey, I have
experienced ﬁrst-hand what it means to be a Starbucks partner. How as partners, we
support each other. How as partners, we have a voice in the future of our company.
How as partners, together we create authentic customer experiences in 34,000
stores around the world.
To my Starbucks partners, over the years you have shared with me in round tables,
open forums and store visits, how personal the experience here is for each of you.
You show up each day creating an environment where as partners and as customers.
We all feel that this is my Starbucks, this is your Starbucks, this is our Starbucks. To be
a part of Starbucks is to be a believer. We believe in our Starbucks and we are united
by a mission that goes beyond the pursuit of proﬁt to inspire and nurture the human
spirit, one person, one cup, one neighborhood at a time. We believe in our
Starbucks and we commit each day to our partnership and to one another. We grow,
learn, and evolve together. We show up for one another creating a sense of
belonging, community and opportunity for our future together. Our Starbucks
showed up for one another as partners during the COVID shutdown. When 40
million Americans were out of work, we protected jobs and paid partners even when
they felt unsafe to come to work.
We provided industry-leading COVID beneﬁts throughout the entire pandemic. And
we invested over $1 billion in incremental wages and training hours. We recognized
the lasting impact the pandemic would have on industry and our customers and
acted quickly to accelerate our strategies of trade area transformation and digital
innovation to respond. Our Starbucks is creating opportunity for each other with free
tuition for over 20,000 partners who are currently on their way to a college degree
through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan with Arizona State University. Our
Starbucks is also creating opportunity for over 100,000 coﬀee farmers who areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-16

Page 4 of 29Felicia Nelsonengaged with our farmer support centers growing sustainable coﬀee and improving
the prosperity of their family farms. Our Starbucks is on a journey where each day we
embrace a culture of inclusion, diversity, and equity, and we never stopped caring
for our planet.
Our Starbucks is contributing to a better future through sustainable coﬀee and dairy
practices, building greener stores and shifting toward re-usable cup solutions as we
reduce our waste, water, and carbon footprint. You'll hear more about all of this
today. You see, as believers that this is our Starbucks, we have proven time and time
again we can work together to ﬁnd solutions to any obstacle and any challenge we
face. And while we haven't been perfect, we work each day staying true to our
mission and living our values. As Rossann will share later, we have more work to do
to reduce complexity in our stores and free up more time so you can do what you do
best, create meaningful connections with our customers and communities. I
recognize the evolving backdrop of union discussions continues to present
uncertainty, requires more progress, and is a point on which diﬀerent views exist.
But I want to assure our partners that no matter the outcome, Starbucks fundamental
commitment to its partners will remain. We have always been a people-focused
company dedicated to doing right by our partners and our customers. Staying true
to the vision of our Starbucks is the only true path forward.
What is unfolding in the world around us in many ways is unfathomable. We've
navigated through a global pandemic only to now witness a humanitarian crisis
unfolding in Ukraine, unprovoked attacks on innocent people. It's horriﬁc, it's
devastating and we are so much better than that, as a global society. We need one
another; we need humanity like never before. As our Starbucks journey continues
and as the world brings more challenges that we will navigate, every one of us as
partners can proudly say, this is my Starbucks, this is your Starbucks, this is our
Starbucks.
As believers in this great company, the only way forward is together showing up to
do the right thing, even when it's hard. Now I hope today's program reminds us all
of the partnership that is so uniquely Starbucks. I am a believer in our Starbucks.
Thank you.
I grew up in East Oakland, California, with my grandparents and my mother. One of
the things that really inspired me about my grandfather was he didn't give up. I knew
very early on that I was a leader. A lot of the times in my career I was overlooked or
belittled not only because of the color of my skin, but because I do have a lot of
tattoos. I started to doubt myself and I switched to Starbucks. I started to see what
the company had to oﬀer as far as movement and promotions development, but it
was unclear what they needed from me to advance. I felt like Starbucks just wasn't a
place for me. And then our new district manager came in with a diﬀerent mind-frame
and she walks in with this big ball of energy and she says, what do you do here? IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-16

want to be an ASM.
And within the ﬁrst week of meeting her, we were sitting down going over a
development plan. To get the phone call to say that you are now a store manager
was literally mind blowing. Getting that, okay, to be myself and to lead, that ﬁre re-lit
inside of me. I decided I wanted to be a store manager that leads the way that I
would like to be led. You want people to feel good to work for you and work for the
company. Kristen made me feel heard; she took the time to actually speak me. You
have so many amazing people that work for our company. So where do we ﬁnd that
balance for each other, where we're still holding accountability, but we're genuinely
listening to one another so that we can support each other during this journey?
When you bring others along with you and you support others to get to their goal
too, you feel so much better and you build bonds that are everlasting.
{BIO 18658634 <GO>}
Felicia, thank you for sharing your brave and inspiring story with all of us. I'm so
grateful to be your partner and I want to thank you and thank all our partners who
like Felicia, help us create a company we can all be proud of, one that stands for
humanity and honors our mission to inspire and nurture the human spirit. And that
always, always starts with partners ﬁrst. We faced two incredibly challenging years,
they were hard and sometimes scary and I'm so proud of all we've done these past
two years and how our partners inspired the best ideas to lead through the
pandemic. We did that by actively listening, learning, and working together. As an
example, we still meet almost every week with nearly 9,000 of our managers to talk
about our successes, our concerns, and how we can best support each other.
And that's on top of all the listening sessions, round-table conversations, and one-to-
one discussions we have where we're out visiting markets across the country, where
we stay connected, hear feedback and gather ideas. That connection and those rich
partner conversations have led us through the pandemic and inspired the most
courageous decisions we've ever made. I'm really proud that even when the
business was down and we decided to close stores, we protected jobs and wages
and our partner investments weren't slowed down either. In fact, we accelerated
them. I don't know of any other company that has done more than we have to
support people during the pandemic. We oﬀered partners additional wages to come
to work if they felt safe to do so. We oﬀered paid time for vaccinations and boosters.
We oﬀered self-isolation pay for partners exposed to COVID. And all of this was
above anything that was required. We did this knowing that it was the right thing to
do, this is who we are.
And we also invested in the areas partners have told us are most important to them.
Partners have asked for continued investment in their experience. This past year, we
committed to an additional $1 billion in wages and training. In fact, partner hourly
pay has increased an average of 17% over 18 months, and this summer, starting
wages will range from $15 to $23 an hour. Additionally, this past January we invested
in pay increases for partners with more than two years of service. But it's about more
than just pay and beneﬁts, we're bringing partner ideas to life to make work easierFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-16

shift marketplace app that makes it easy for partners to switch and oﬀer shifts
virtually. Our automated ordering system that saves store time and new handheld
ordering devices.
Partners also inspired and helped design faster and more innovative equipment like
our new Merrychef ovens, our new Mastrena 2 espresso machines and the new
Starbucks cold brewer. And there's so much more to come, more training for new
baristas, expanding our lift-ride program for partners to get to and from work, and
celebrating our college achievement plan where partners receive a 100% tuition
coverage. Today, we honor the over 20,000 partners enrolled across the U.S. We are
just coming out of one of the most complex times of our lives and I'm proud of how
we ﬁgured it out together and service each other, our customers, and our
communities. And we are going to use this exact same approach as we build our
future, the way only Starbucks can. I know we will be the very best Starbucks we can
be because of how we've learned to work so deeply and meaningfully over these
past two years. It is my number one priority, commitment, and promise and I know
we're just getting started together.
It starts with our partners. I became a partner 15 years ago and like a lot of my fellow
partners, I joined Starbucks because I wanted to be part of a great company that is a
positive force in the world. Growing up, I'd always thought that if I wanted to play a
role in changing the world, I needed to pursue non-proﬁt work. Before joining
Starbucks, I was skeptical about the role of a company in society. In the last 15 years, I
have discovered the breadth and depth of the positive impact a committed
company can have around the world. I'm Virginia Tenpenny, Starbucks' Chief Global
Social Impact Oﬃcer, and I'm honored to share more about our continued
commitment to use our scale for good and our bold new ambitions to drive even
more impactful change. Over the last two years, our partners and their communities
have been confronted with a seemingly never-ending wave of unprecedented
challenges.
As we all attempted to navigate through global pandemic, partners downed their
green aprons and took care of each other, their customers, and their neighborhoods.
They did this through signiﬁcant adversity because of their character and resilience.
Our stores became a place of respite and a beacon of light in an otherwise
challenging time. While Sam touched on some of the ways we are supporting
partners here in the U.S., outside the U.S., we have other innovative partner beneﬁts
to help address unique needs in diﬀerent parts of the world. Our apprenticeship and
home-suite loan programs in the UK helps partners tackle the cost of living by
providing interest free loans. In China, we provide a monthly housing subsidy for full-
time Starbucks baristas and shift supervisors.
Around the world, we continue to listen deeply to our partners to understand their
needs and will remain laser focused and ensuring we are constantly working to
enhance every aspect of the green apron experience, this work is never done. OurFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-16

Virginia Bergin Tenpennygreatest impact on society is through our jobs and the experience of the hundreds
of thousands of partners who wear the green apron all over the world.
I love this company so much because you can show up to work every day and be
your true, authentic self, and just be loved and embraced for that. And you can do
that for others and make them feel seen, make them feel welcome, make them feel
safe, during these challenging times that we're all in. My partners have taken
advantage of a lot of Starbucks beneﬁts that have really helped them. We provide
health insurance, medical, dental, vision, 401K, which is also matched. We provide
free counseling sessions through Lyra, we just used our bean stock and Fidelity
beneﬁts to purchase our ﬁrst home. Working at Starbucks over the last 13 years, I've
really grown up as a person and as a leader in this company. And I have had so many
awesome mentors, so many awesome leaders that have taken the time to truly invest
in me and help me prioritize my personal growth in so many ways.
As we enter a new chapter as a global society and better understand the needs of
partners and communities, there is always an opportunity to do more and a new way
to use our scale for good. For us, people positive means impacting all who come
into contact with Starbucks with a goal to ignite mutual thriving across all
communities. Our business depends on this. From our partners to customers,
farmers, suppliers, and those who live in the communities we serve, our aspiration is
to not only touch, but enhance the lives of one billion people, one eighth of the
world's population by 2030. It's a bold aspiration and it starts with being the world's
most welcoming place where everyone feels a sense of belonging. As we build on
our legacy as a people-ﬁrst company, we will focus on and measure the positive
outcomes for the people we touch.
Our aspiration will be supported by speciﬁc commitments, public accountability, and
meaningful actions. Our impact radiates from the inside out and our commitments
start with our partners. Through relevant hiring commitments around the world, we
will remove barriers to opportunity and ensure partners feel a sense of belonging
with their Starbucks family. We will continue to innovate, to provide world-class
beneﬁts for partners everywhere. We will guarantee all partners have tools and
agency to chart their journey to mental and emotional wellbeing and plan to invest
$100 million in emotional and mental support systems for all partners by 2030. We
will pioneer a new industry standard for inclusive store design and share it with
others. These design principles will enhance the store experience for partners and
customers, reinforcing our commitment to the world's most welcoming place.

proud of the 100 military family stores that serve to honor our troops and military
families and connect more Americans with military communities. We have much to
learn from these communities. They are resilient, purpose-driven, and understand
the power of better together. Today, we are proud to announce the expansion of the
community store model with the goal of 1,000 locally relevant stores by 2030.
These stores oﬀer a unique way for Starbucks to celebrate diversity, engage
untapped talent, and uplift communities around the world. Beyond our store walls,
we will strengthen communities by focusing our purchasing power, philanthropic
investments and igniting partnerships to advance social equity and promote
community wellbeing. Late last year we announced a $100 million investment to
promote food security in the U.S., today, we are announcing the global expansion of
our commitment and we'll activate our ecosystem of business partners to strengthen
food security from coﬀee-growing communities to the neighborhoods we serve. On
top of these corporate investments, last year alone, the Starbucks foundation
contributed $20 million in grants to strengthen communities around the world and
we'll continue to expand our global philanthropic ambitions.
This includes a new foundation goal to uplift one million women and girls in coﬀee,
tea, and cocoa growing communities by 2030. We know when we invest in women
and girls; we strengthen the economic vitality of their communities. Additionally, the
foundation will continue to invite our partners to nominate locally relevant causes for
neighborhood grants. By 2030, we'll have grown this program from 3,500
neighborhoods in the U.S. and Canada to 25,000 neighborhoods around the world.
These organizations are nominated by our very own partners. We are joining forces
with our business partners across the globe to serve as champions for our
communities. And we won't stop there, our ambitions are bigger than Starbucks, but
we cannot achieve this alone. To accelerate a positive transition to greater wellbeing
for everyone, we will look beyond ourselves and collaborate across global markets
and industries.
We will engage the world's leading retailers to collaborate, develop, and adopt new
practice that uplift the wellbeing of people in essential retail jobs. Creating a new
model for companies to be engines of wellbeing, all with one mission, to co-create
scalable solutions that shift our systems to promote social equity and enhance
wellbeing, all in service to a more thriving global society. Through these goals,
strategies, and measures, we will hold ourselves accountable to our aspirations and
goals to be a people positive company. Our opportunity and impact starts on the
inside with our partners and radiates out to the communities around the world. We
will ﬁnd the edge of the possible to promote belonging, unleash potential, and
realize mutual thriving for partners, farmers, and communities. While our goal is to
enhance the wellbeing of one billion people who connect with Starbucks in some
way, it starts with one partner, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.

movement, we were able to collectively have a voice and advocate for how we
wanted Starbucks to show up. And as I was hearing the stories of the partners, like
my heart just broke all of their experiences that they had growing up are all of the
same experiences that I had as well. When I think about my journey as a partner, I
think about the fact that the person that you see in front of you today is diﬀerent,
completely diﬀerent from the person that walked in through the doors four-and-a-
half years ago. And I have to attribute a lot of that to the programming and the
conversations that we have as a company, but most importantly, the spaces and
community have in the partner network group. And so I'm really thankful for that.

I love Florence's story because in many ways it reminds me of my journey. Hello, I'm
Dennis Brockman, Starbucks Global Chief Inclusion and Diversity Oﬃcer. And I have
the pleasure of sharing with you our ongoing eﬀorts in creating a Starbucks where
everyone feels welcomed. I was a young man when I ﬁrst became exposed to the
realities of systemic discrimination, segregation, disparities in health, wealth,
housing, and employment were a way of life. The idea that a young black boy could
dream of one day going to college and aspire to be something great existed in my
home with my mother and siblings, in my church, and within my community. But the
dream often stopped there. Like many black, indigenous, and people of color, we're
encouraged to dream big and then we're taught to keep those dreams to ourselves
out of fear that someone might question our desire for more. Our desire for true
freedom and autonomy.
And while we don't have the antidote to dismantle systemic discrimination, we have
the power to make social change through civic engagement, a commitment to our
communities and one another. That starts with our own role in driving to create more
equitable Starbucks. So we're set to continue and build on commitments, aim to
increase diversity and promote inclusion across all of Starbucks. Two years ago, we
announced a 2025 goal to achieve bi-pop representation of at least 30% at all
corporate levels and at least 40% of all retail and manufacturing roles. We took on
this challenge with not only intentionality, but by taking an honest look at ourselves,
then worked together to develop programs and setting expectations. Just last
month, we shared our progress towards that goal, and I am pleased to share we are
well on our way to reaching our milestones and then setting new goals.
At Starbucks, every day partners have demonstrated anything is possible when
guided by our mission to inspire. Our partner networks starting with our LGBTQ
partner aﬃnity group in 1996, our partner-led groups that bring together people with
shared identities and experiences, along with allies to promote a culture of inclusion
and contribute to the success of our partners and our business. Starbucks has 12
partner networks each with unique goals that align with our mission and values. They
are thoughtful advocates and powerful voices to help promote change and
understanding within the organization and beyond. They have a passion and will to
drive change and create space for everyone. These networks are just one way weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 10 of 29Unidentiﬁed Speakercreate inclusion and belonging and one component of Starbucks commitment to
drive real actionable change towards being a more equitable company.
We're also steadfast in holding accountability at the highest levels of the
organization, tying the building of inclusive and diverse team building to our
executive compensation program, building on the success of our inaugural
mentorship program. Our second class has been expanded to include additional
senior leaders and self-identiﬁed bi-pop partners with disability and LGBTQIA+ at
the director and manager level. And the launch of our leadership accelerated
program, focus on empowering partners capacity for self-promotion, advocacy, and
career navigation while increasing diverse representation and the leadership
pipeline at Starbucks. We are well aware we don't always get it right at Starbucks. We
have experienced setbacks in our journey forward to a more inclusive, diverse and
equitable company and our partners are holding us accountable. And it's their
thoughts, feelings, and perspectives that makes us better.
Nothing is more important than continuing to invest in the most diverse workforce in
Starbucks history. The action of our journey continues every day as we work to
advance racial and social equity for our partners and our communities with
intentionality, transparency, and accountability. We all have a role to contribute and
it's with that purpose in mind that we continue to invest in these areas for all
partners. Learning comes by doing and that's what we are committed to. As a 14-year
partner, I've prided it myself in living Starbucks' mission and values. With a clear
approach, real inclusion requires intent. When we do that, we have the power to
refrain and normalize diversity actions that nurture and embrace our cultural
complexities, provide proof that we are committed to real change. For over 50 years,
Starbucks have been led by its mission and values. For eight years, we have held a
perfect score on the disability equality index.
And since 2018, we have maintained 100% pay equity for women and men and
people of all races performing similar work in the U.S. These eﬀorts extend around
the world through intentionality, transparency and accountability we will continue to
make substantial change on behalf of all of our partners to ensure Starbucks is the
brand of choice and being the most diverse, inclusive, equitable, and accessible
company. I am proud of how this company has evolved and I'm even prouder of our
partner's commitment to our journey.
Starbucks is working on going zero waste. It's really a signiﬁcant thing, especially to
the generation that's working in Starbucks right now.
I don't think a lot of people know, for every bag of beans sold, it helps plant a new
tree. We really help connect with farmers globally in reinvigorating their areas, and
what they're doing. I genuinely feel like I'm working for a company that does care.
And the initiatives such as moving towards paper straws, moving towards eliminating
unnecessary plastics, moving towards sustainable packaging and things like that are
wonderful initiatives.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-16

{BIO 17845948 <GO>}
Hello, Starbucks partners and shareholders, I'm Brady Brewer, a 20-year partner. I
have the honor of serving as Chief Marketing Oﬃcer. For us at Starbucks, helping to
create a sustainable future for our planet is both the right thing to do and mission
critical to our continued success as a business. Which is why, as Kevin shared earlier,
in 2020, we introduced our bold multi-decade aspiration to give more than we take
from the planet starting with a 50% reduction in our carbon, water, and waste
footprints by 2030. Over the past two years we've made meaningful progress
towards those goals with coﬀee farmers, our suppliers, our licensees, and our
partners with a focus on testing and innovating and learning to create bold and
scalable sustainability solutions, all for the betterment of people, coﬀee and the
planet.
In fact, I'm here at our Tryer Center with partners who are passionate about
anticipating and creating game changing innovation making day-to-day life easier
for fellow partners and creating experiences that customers love. Our partners,
customers, and the communities we serve expect us to lead and for many years, our
partners have taken action to encourage Starbucks planet positive aspirations. Our
greener apron program is one example. In 2017, our partners worked with Arizona
State University to create the Starbucks Global Academy Greener Apron Course to
develop environmentally-minded leaders at every level of the company. Let's hear
from Sina [ph] one of our greener apron partners.
I came to Starbucks because I heard of the Starbucks college achievement plan and I
wanted to pursue a long-term goal of mine of continuing a higher education and
studying sustainability. I learned about the greener apron program and I was so
excited to learn more about Starbucks sustainability initiatives. Afterwards, I wanted
to go and implement these in my store. Some of these were rolling out food share
ahead of launch, implementing grounds for your garden at my store and
encouraging my partners and my customers to use reusable cups. During my senior
year of ASU, I had the opportunity to join a fellowship with the global sustainability
team at Starbucks.
My project was to develop a sustainability activation for store partners. I created
earth bingo, which was a challenge that was sent to all U.S. company operated stores
with small actions that they can take in their store and their community that created
big changes. All of this led to be accepting a permanent role on the global
sustainability team. This means I now support the greener apron program in bringing
sustainability to partners around the world.

Page 12 of 29Michelle BurnsPartners like Sina, who are bringing our mission and values to life every day in their
stores are why I'm proud to be a Starbucks partner. More than 15,000 partners have
completed the greener apron course since it launched and it's one of the many ways
we'll continue to engage partners and customers on the sustainability journey
together. As the world's largest retailer of specialty coﬀee, we embrace our
responsibility to care for the planet knowing that we will need a long-term supply of
the world's ﬁnest coﬀee. And with that responsibility comes the fundamental need to
support the people that care for coﬀee at every stage of its journey, from farm to
customer. To share more about how Starbucks is investing in sustainability to ensure
the best outcomes for coﬀee farmers and the land, I'd like to hand it over to Michelle
Burns, who leads Starbucks Global coﬀee, tea, and Cocoa tea.
{BIO 20642917 <GO>}
Thank you, Brady. Hello, coﬀee is and always has been at the core of our business.
I'm here today where I start most of my mornings in one of our stores where our
partners complete the last ten feet of our coﬀee's journey. But today I'd like to talk
about where that journey begins from seed to cup, the ﬁrst ten feet at the farms.
Now, from the beginning, we've been committed to sourcing coﬀee responsibly for
the betterment of both people and the planet. And that's why almost two decades
ago, we set out to design our ethical sourcing program to promote transparent,
proﬁtable, and sustainable coﬀee growing practices while also protecting the
wellbeing of coﬀee farmers and workers, their families, and their communities. We
call this our coﬀee and farmer equity program or C.A.F.E. Practices. The reality is it
has never been more challenging to be a coﬀee farmer.
Conditions like climate change, drought, market volatility, increasing costs and socio-
political factors have all put the future of coﬀee at risk. Last year, we announced
ambitious goals to reduce green coﬀee's impact on the environment, focused on
reducing our carbon and water footprint, and we've been hard at work ever since.
One example where we are very focused is fertilizer, it is one of the biggest
contributors to carbon emissions on farms. In fact, it makes up over one-third of the
carbon emissions in our entire green coﬀee supply chain. To help farmers minimize
its use, we're implementing various tools and technology to collect soil samples and
gather data to inform custom plants. Now, with these plans, farmers will be able to
make more informed decisions around soil health and management; ultimately
helping them increase productivity and quality, save costs, and importantly, reduce
their carbon footprint.
To date, we've collected data that provides guidance to impact more than 100,000
of the 400,000 coﬀee farms we source from today. This is meaningful and rapid
progress toward our ambitions and our holistic approach to caring for people and
planet. In addition to our environmental work, we continue to build on our people
positive foundation by helping farmers and their communities improve their social
and ﬁnancial wellbeing, knowing that these are critical factors to their future success.
Now I'd love to share with you an example of all of this work coming together. Let
me take you to Narino, a breathtakingly beautiful remote coﬀee community in the
Hills of Columbia, where my team and I have been working with local farmers on anFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-16

Michelle Burnsincredible new initiative. Here, alongside our farmer support center partners and our
coﬀee suppliers, we've launched a holistic sustainable ﬁve-year coﬀee program.
We're aﬀectionately calling it Granos de Esperanza or grains of hope. Take a look.
In Colombia, coﬀee is produced where you see exuberant nature that we need to
protect before it's gone. I am the project manager of Granos de Esperanza, the
project is focused on the new generation of coﬀee growers of Narino. So we're
working with young people and women that are in the coﬀee business, and we are
helping them to increase their productivity, but also learning with them how to
produce coﬀee more sustainably.
Okay, so we are going to show you guys what we have been working on.
We are building the proper infrastructure for them to adopt the technologies that we
are implementing in the program. We are trying to consume less water in the coﬀee
processing; we are training our farmers on best management, nutrition, on
measuring the environmental impact that we are having on the farms. And we are
trying to register and monitor every change that we see, so we can show people
positive impacts of having a sustainable production.

{BIO 20642917 <GO>}
This is my, your and our Starbucks and seeing this work come to life gives all of us
hope for the future of coﬀee and those who grow it. I'm proud to support coﬀee
farmers alongside our partners in every store around the world who bring the
Starbucks experience to life in the last ten feet every day. As we all know, the world is
complex. Supply chain challenges and inﬂation remain headline news around the
world. Coﬀee prices have risen dramatically over the past year and the impacts of
climate are evident. More people are drinking coﬀee, and we know the demand for
high-quality sustainable coﬀee will continue. We plan to be here for decades to
come. For us at Starbucks, we will continue to invest in farmers and their
communities and work to identify new and innovative solutions to improve the lives
and livelihoods of farmers everywhere. In fact, this commitment to innovation
touches on every part of our supply chain, including tea, cocoa, and dairy.
And with that, I'd now like to introduce my partner, Michael Kobori, our Chief
Sustainability Oﬃcer, to share more about our work to support the long-term health
of the dairy industry. Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-16

Thank you, Michelle. Dairy is an essential part of some of Starbucks most beloved
handcrafted beverages. From the very ﬁrst, our latte to my favorite, the vanilla sweet
cream cold brew. More than half of our handcrafted beverages are made with dairy,
which makes Starbucks a large purchaser of dairy in the United States. At the same
time, nearly a quarter of our carbon emissions come from dairy. We know we need
to look at ways to test learn and be part of the solution to reduce dairy emission, so
we can become a resource positive company. Let's hear ﬁrsthand from our partner,
Nicole, to learn how her team is supporting the long-term health of the dairy
industry.
Within our sustainable dairy program, we are now working with dairies building a
program to address sustainability on dairy farms that can move towards zero
emissions. It's possible and that's what Starbucks is doing with our dairy supply to
get to that goal. What's going on under this big bubble is methane gas production.
So the manure in there has a lot of diﬀerent microbes, one of those is methanogens
and they produce methane. When we let that release to the environment, it has a
greenhouse gas eﬀect. So instead, this lagoon cover, also known as an anaerobic
digester is capturing all the methane that's produced from the manure. What people
really don't understand is how many amazing things are happening on dairies and
how forward thinking they are, the innovations that are happening here to make
things more sustainable.
{BIO 16364008 <GO>}
Nicole, thank you so much. As a company that works with and relies on the farming
community every day, I'm so proud of the work that you and your team are doing to
help drive solutions that support both people and our planet to achieve our bold
aspirations. We need to not only work with our suppliers, but across the entire dairy
industry and with all who touch Starbucks. That's why we joined the U.S. dairy net-
zero initiative with a commitment to spending $10 million to work with the industry to
research and test new approaches including more sustainable cow feed, manure
management and on-farm energy eﬃciency. In addition, we're partnering with the
nature conservancy to help reﬁne and scale our sustainable dairy standards. And
we're taking our eﬀorts global where we're working with our dairy suppliers in
Europe to pilot sustainable dairy with farmers in the UK.
Our shared goal is to make sustainable practices and technologies more accessible
and aﬀordable to dairy farmers all around the world so our customers can feel good
about their choices with every sip.
{BIO 17845948 <GO>}

Page 15 of 29our stores. With more than 34,000 store locations across 84 markets, this is where it
all connects. Around the world, our customers are drawn in by our unique and
beautiful designs, warm atmosphere, perfectly crafted coﬀee, and welcoming
partners. Each one of our stores requires an array of materials, water, and electricity
to provide the Starbucks experience. And these resources are ﬁnite. We see an
opportunity to do much better in our use of these resources. The innovation we're
developing right now aims to minimize our impact in a way that drives the future of
green retail for the world. To drive change across the retail industry, we've created a
set of practices called the Starbucks Greener Stores Framework.
These principles are available for free to the world and establish a new benchmark,
an environmentally responsible retail for design construction and operations.
Starbucks currently is certiﬁed more than 2,300 greener stores in the U.S. and
Canada. And last year we announced a commitment to expand the program. In
partnership with our international licensees, we've set a goal of building and
retroﬁtting 10,000 greener stores globally in the next three years. Last year, we
opened the ﬁrst two greener stores outside of North America in Shanghai and in
Tokyo with new stores opening later this year in the UK and Chile. Knowing that each
region we serve has a diverse set of needs, we've adapted the greener store's
framework to achieve reductions in carbon emissions, water usage, and landﬁll
waste in locally relevant ways.
Our partners are proud of this work and we're seeing more engagement and
excitement from partners who are proud to be a part of the sustainable shift in our
business. And we're already beginning to see how the greener store's ecosystem is
enabling more sustainable behaviors for our customers. Just one example, since
opening the doors of the Tokyo greener store in December of last year, more than
half of visitors have chosen reusable options for their beverages either through the
choice of a ceramic mug, a glass, or bringing in their personal cup, or our innovative
borrow-a-cup pilot program. Here at our Tryer Center is where we developed the
Starbucks borrow-a-cup program. The Starbucks cup is a globally recognized brand
icon and while it can be recycled in certain locations, it can only be used once and
that needs to change.
But with approximately 80% of Starbucks beverages enjoyed on the go, how do we
make choosing reusable cups as convenient and delightful as you'd expect from
Starbucks? We know this for sure, we can't do it alone, we need to work together,
Starbucks and you to make reusables a part of everyday life. Within the next year, our
goal is to make it easier for many customers around the world to use a personal or
Starbucks provided reusable cup for every visit. Whether ordering in the cafe, in the
drive-through, or even mobile order and pay, we want our customers to be excited
to choose reusables every time. Our ﬁrst borrow-a-cup pilot in Seattle taught us a lot
about what customers need to adopt more sustainable behaviors. And we continue
to work with our licensed business partners around the world to understand more.
Building on what we've learned so far, we're now scaling multiple reusable pilots
across the globe, including Arizona, Hawaii, New York, Washington DC, Wisconsin,
all to ﬁnd out the best incentives and then test the program. In South Korea, our ﬁrstFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-16

reusables to the entire island of Jeju and we'll cover Seoul by the end of this year. In
Japan, we're learning from oﬃce workers and tourists in Tokyo's Marunouchi
Business District. And in Singapore, we're learning from local students at three stores
on the campus of the National University of Singapore. And in the UK, we're testing
at a variety of stores, including a drive-through, to prepare for a rollout across all
4,000 EMEA stores by 2025. And this is just the beginning. We will begin more pilots
and testing next week in France and Switzerland, all with more markets to roll out
later this year.
Now our partners are passionate about sustainability and together we create
amazing ideas and change. Seven years ago, partners created the Partners for
Sustainability Network, from the ground up to educate, engage, and empower fellow
partners to drive sustainable change. Today, there are 6,000 members around the
world, who are bringing local partner-driven sustainability innovation to Starbucks
and their communities. One of these partners is Erica who participated in our
greener store innovation challenge where we asked partners to submit ideas to
make Starbucks even more sustainable. She drove the development of Starbucks'
newest digital innovation, The Partner Recycling App. Let's take a look.
We handle waste every day as a business and in our lives. Recycling is one of the
biggest ways we can really make an impact. Our partners, our customers want to do
the right thing for the planet, but they don't know how to do it. They need accurate
and personalized information. This app provides store speciﬁc recycling information
at their ﬁngertips, empowering them to take actions for their future and the planet. It
was a passion project and I'm excited what we can learn from it. How do we keep
making it better? That's the thing that drives me the most is the impact.
{BIO 17845948 <GO>}
Our partners and customers have always held Starbucks to a higher standard and we
all share a passionate belief in the role that business can play in sustainability. The
journey to reach our aspirations will be challenging, but Starbucks is committed to
taking a leadership role in the industry, using our scale for good. We see our work as
a virtuous circle where our innovation, investment in people, and our more
sustainable operations enable us to grow our business while supporting a thriving
future for people and the planet. As we look ahead to the bold aspirations we've set,
we are challenging ourselves and our business partners to think bigger and do

One of the coolest things about Tryer is that there's a lot of innovation that happens
here that we get to be a part of from the start of the idea to the end result, you're
testing it. And it's a lot of fun being one of those partners that gets to test it before
it's launched.
It is very important for me to be a part of the process, because I have a voice on
what's going to happen, and I can give them perspective that they probably don't
have.
We're kind of the experts in the store. We are going to be the best people to ask,
because we're the most current on operations. It was really cool getting to see the

Hello, and welcome everyone. My name's Rachel Ruggeri, and I have the privilege of
serving as the Chief Financial Oﬃcer of Starbucks. Although February 1st marked my
ﬁrst full-year in this role, I've been a partner for over 17 years and seen our company
navigate through store reinventions, global expansion and incredible digital growth.
We didn't even know what the word app was when I started in this business. Through
it all, I remained so proud to not only be a partner, but also a customer and a
shareholder. The pandemic has changed our lives forever and I'm proud that we've
built a company that has demonstrated ﬂexibility, meeting the needs of our partners,
customers, and shareholders in a way that creates value for everyone. Each one of
you listening is either a partner, a customer, a shareholder, or a combination of these
just like me. And that's what I want to focus on today, the fact that this is not only my
Starbucks, but it's your Starbucks, it's our Starbucks, all of ours.
And if you remember anything from what I say, it is this, through our growth, by
being proﬁt positive, we will continue creating value for all. Now, although I'm a
partner, I am ﬁrst and foremost, a customer. I'm here at the Downtown Seattle pickup
store just a few blocks from our very ﬁrst store in Pike Place Market. This is my kind of
Starbucks because, and now this may not surprise you, but I am always on the go,
and being able to quickly grab my morning iced Grande quad espresso with extra,
extra ice is perfect for me. But what works for me, doesn't work for everyone, and
that my friends is what makes Starbucks diﬀerent. At Starbucks we recognize that
one size does not ﬁt all, our success has been rooted in how we diﬀerentiate
ourselves, meeting customers where they need us to be from the personal
connections our partners make with our customers every single day to our store
formats and our menu oﬀerings. It's how we create your Starbucks.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 18 of 29How do we do this? We call it our growth at scale agenda, being proﬁt positive while
growing responsibly with focus and discipline driving double-digit EPS growth at
scale. This is the framework that's helped to successfully navigate the past few years
in a way that's ﬂexible and adaptable, critical to operating in these dynamic times.
Our approach has led to consistent growth in revenue and income including
earnings growth in the double digits. This past year our revenue grew to 21% with
operating income growth of 139% and EPS growing to $3.24. This was well above our
guidance range, driven in large part by our faster than expected recovery. But
importantly, this growth has served as fuel for our critical investments, most notably
our investments in our partners. There is no better way to diﬀerentiate our brand
than through the amazing experience that our partners create for our customers, that
is our magic.
Let me talk more speciﬁcally about our growth at scale agenda. Simply put, it is a
framework that's powered by purpose-built design allowing us to diﬀerentiate
through three key strategic areas of focus. One, elevated customer experience, two,
breakthrough beverage and coﬀee innovation, three, expanded digital customer
relationships. And this is all underpinned by continued investments in our partners.
Let's ﬁrst start with our partner investments. Our partners are what makes Starbucks
so special and investments in our partners are essential to our success. Since ﬁscal
year 2020, we have tripled the investments in support of our partners, and we are
dedicated to make the right investments in the right areas today, tomorrow, and in
the future. These include competitive wages, industry-leading beneﬁts, positive store
environments, and comprehensive training and onboarding.
And since our industry leading beneﬁts include bean stock for our partners, our
partners are also shareholders. So our investment in them is an investment in you.
Why? Because this is our Starbucks. Let's take a look at our elevated customer
experience which is best demonstrated through our stores. We're building our stores
with diﬀerent formats and diﬀerent proﬁles to better meet our customers where they
need us to be. Sometimes customers want to meet a friend in one of our cafes.
In China, we have a store that oﬀers a pet friendly area, staﬀed by pet friendly
partners, making it a community for pet owners. As a dog lover myself, that store
would be my ﬁrst choice or perhaps they'd like to just pop in for a moment to have a
bright spot in their day. Other times they're more like a marathon runner who wants
to get their vanilla latte or cup of coﬀee on the go like you'll ﬁnd in our drive-
throughs with curbside delivery or in a pick-up store like this one.
Now let's talk numbers. We ended ﬁscal year 2021 with nearly 34,000 stores globally
with more than half of those stores located outside of the U.S. Importantly, we
substantially completed our trade area transformation plan strengthening our
portfolio as customers migrated from Metro to suburban areas across North
America. This drove greater returns on our investment with cash margins increasingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 19 of 29to approximately 29% and ROI of approximately 55%, a notable improvement from
what we shared at our most recent Investor Day.
In China, we continue to open stores at a record pace growing 14% year-over-year on
a net new store basis as we shifted our design focus to smaller footprints, lower
tiered cities, and enhanced delivery capacity to support increasing demand for
convenience. These stores also demonstrated best-in-class economics furthering our
belief in the long-term opportunity within this growing market.
Our new stores globally drive new customers and new occasions. They are critical to
our growth and give us every conﬁdence that we can successfully drive to 55,000
stores in a 100 markets by 2030. In addition to stores, we're also innovating through
our product oﬀerings giving our customers more reasons to come in and visit us.
We're continuing to see strong growth from our enticing beverage innovation,
notably in cold espresso and plant-based products, two of our fastest growing
categories. We see both of these trends that work with the delicious new ice- toasted
vanilla oat milk shaken espresso. It's my personal favorite for an afternoon treat and
it's a nice compliment to my morning iced-quad espresso. Our customers, myself
included, crave cold beverages. With cold accounting for nearly 70% of our total
beverage sales last year, up approximately 20% points over the past three years. As
we like to say, cold is hot, triple the tees on that hot.
Now, shifting to our Tryer Center, our coﬀee and equipment experts have been
working side by side with our partner stores to develop a new cold espresso. This
capability will usher in the next great wave of espresso-based innovation, plus it's
easier for our partners to craft. Additionally, the team has also developed an on-
demand brewer, but instead of me telling you about it, how about I show it to you?
(Audio-Video Presentation)
For over 50 years, we have been dedicated to creating that perfect cup of coﬀee
every single time. It's the heart of what we do and it's a game changer. When you
put it all together, our product innovation does more than just fuel our sales growth,
it allows us to oﬀer something for everyone.
Moving on to digital, we have seen how the pandemic accelerated the adoption of
technology and we're working to expand our digital customer relationships. You can
see that right here in this pick-up store where digital oﬀerings are an integral part of
the customer experience. We also continue to innovate with the Starbucks mobile
app. Have you noticed how personalized the food and beverage recommendations
are in your Starbucks app? That's not a coincidence, that's our deep brewed AI
technology at work. And those recommendations will become even more
personalized as our innovation progresses. To simplify your life even further, on your
next vacation, you'll be able to order ahead in one of our licensed airport locations
using the Starbucks app and we're working to bring mobile order and pay to more

enables customers to leverage their app to book private curated experiences at the
local Starbucks as a way to rejuvenate and reinforce the third place experience.
Customers can reserve areas and select stores for private events or register for
immersive coﬀee workshops. Let me share it with you.

Again, we are all about ﬁnding innovative ways to meet our customers where they
need us to be. Innovation has driven our sales growth, evolved to meet the changing
needs of our customers, and pushed the envelope on what it means to be a partner
and a customer-centric company. Now, what does this all mean for you as
shareholders? All of these eﬀorts collectively have created value through increased
return on invested capital and improved capital eﬃciency.
And in spite of unprecedented macroeconomic headwinds, speciﬁcally inﬂationary
pressures, we remain committed to improving margins over the long-term. Over the
past four years, we returned over $25 billion to shareholders, which includes our
partners. And we made a commitment to return $20 billion over the next three years
totaling approximately $45 billion, which is a remarkable 40% of our total market
cap. When you add it all up, elevated customer experience, breakthrough innovation
and beverage and coﬀee, expanded digital customer relationships, all underpinned
by continued investment in our partners, it equals growth. While our growth this year
will not be linear, we are conﬁdent our approach supports a proﬁt positive company
today and over the long-term, creating value for all stakeholders, our partners, our
customers, and our shareholders.
It's our vision to build a diﬀerent kind of company, a company that welcomes all
diﬀerent types of people from every walk of life and all around the world. After all,
this is our Starbucks. I hope to see you in this pick-up store someday soon.
I started right when the pandemic started. Coming here and kept me aﬂoat in really
sad times or challenging times. Especially with the openness here and how free I feel

that went beyond the pursuit of proﬁt. A company that lived up to a set of values and
cared for each other as partners. Starbucks partners united together in a collective
pursuit of a common mission doing something meaningful in this world. As I sat
there at my ﬁrst annual meeting, I had no idea how special journey would be for me.
But I was excited to be there, ﬁlled with enthusiasm, curiosity, and optimism for the
future. Roll forward six years to 2015, I was honored to join the management team,
but I must admit also a bit apprehensive.
After all, I had spent 32 years of my life in the tech industry, what did I know about
retail experiences? What did I know about the intricacies of coﬀee? And because I
hadn't yet experienced it ﬁrst-hand, what was the true meaning of being a Starbucks
partner? In fact, I was retired at the time focusing on my health following a skin
cancer episode and the prospect of a new adventure at Starbucks was both
exhilarating and intimidating. And I am so glad that I embraced this opportunity with
all of the passion, energy, and curiosity that all new Starbucks partners bring to this
great company. Stepping into the CEO role in 2017, I humbly accepted knowing that I
carried a great responsibility, a responsibility to all Starbucks partners. I knew this
required having the wisdom to know what to honor and preserve from the past while
at the same time, the courage to boldly re-imagine the future. It's a delicate balance
that we tried to strike each day for the past 1,808 days.
I think that most days we got it right but I know there were times we didn't. And
when that happened, we learned and adapted, it's what makes us better. To my
Starbucks partners, I want to oﬀer a heartfelt, thank you. You welcomed me in the
stores around the world, you taught me what it means to be a partner, that emotional
connection. We shared stories together in hundreds of partner round tables and
open forums. And when I put on the green apron and went behind the bar, you
would indulge me with a beverage throw-down contest. I have fond memories of
making beverages together, laughing together and sharing stories with each other.
Overcoming challenges and pursuing opportunity together. You are the heartbeat of
Starbucks, our Starbucks, and it has been an honor working in service of you, my
Starbucks partners.
I am a believer in you and to the broad set of stakeholders we serve. From partners,

One day, somebody opened the door, I looked back, this person, she ordered a
latte; I made it with a latte heart. She gave me a massive hug and just said, this is the
most beautiful thing that happened to me today and started crying.
Remembering somebody is so signiﬁcant to every person, that's what it's about.
The most important thing that Starbucks has given me is the opportunity.
Honestly, I have found a home here that I don't want to leave.
I just feel like I can really be myself around all of my partners and makes me feel like
I'm part of something.
I feel incredibly thankful that I have this community to grow and learn.
We care for each other. I love what I do, and I love being part of Starbucks.

Good morning, partners and shareholders. My name is Jennifer Kraft and my
pronouns are she and her. I have been a Starbucks partner for a year-and-a-half and I
currently serve as our Corporate Secretary. It's my privilege to join you to present the
formal portion of our meeting. I became a Starbucks partner during an incredibly
challenging time for our company and our communities around the world as we all
navigated the quickly changing landscape and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
As a relatively new partner, I have experienced ﬁrsthand, the sense of community
and connection that is so deeply rooted in the Starbucks mission, values, and culture,
and how it deﬁnes who we are as partners. And as a company, during an incredibly
challenging time, I am proud of our unwavering commitment to serve and support
our communities and each other. I want to thank all of my fellow partners who
shared their stories with us today.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-16

Jennifer KraftThe ﬁfth and last item of business is the shareholder proposal submitted by the state
of New York oﬃce of the state comptroller related to the preparation of annual
reports regarding the prevention of harassment and discrimination in the workplace.
We will now hear from Gianna McCarthy, Director, Corporate Governance, a
representative of the New York State Comptroller, to present the proposal.
{BIO 16515161 <GO>}
Good morning, Chair Hobson, Members of the Board of Directors and Management
and fellow Starbucks stakeholders. I am presenting proposal ﬁve on the proxy on
behalf of New York State Comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, Trustee of the New York
state common retirement fund which held over 2.5 million shares of Starbucks
valued at approximately $296 million as of December 31st, 2021. The proposal
requests for report describing and quantifying the eﬀectiveness and outcomes of
company eﬀorts to prevent harassment and discrimination against protected classes
of employees including but not limited to sexual harassment and racial
discrimination.
Some of the data that would assist shareholders in this assessment include the total
number and aggregate dollar amount of dispute settled by the company related to
sexual abuse or harassment or discrimination based on race, religion, sex, national
origin, age, disability, genetic information, service member status, gender identity, or
sexual orientation. The average length of time it takes to resolve harassment
complaints. The total number of pending harassment or discrimination complaints
the company is seeking to resolve through internal processes or through litigation.
And whether the company uses nondisclosure or mandatory arbitration clauses in
employment agreements. The company's assessment as to any negative eﬀects on
worker's ability to seek redress and whether any exceptions are provided for
harassment and discrimination matters.
Comptroller DiNapoli is requesting the report outlined in proposal ﬁve because
workplace abuse, harassment and discrimination can result in substantial cost to
companies including cost related to employee turnover, increased absenteeism, and
reduced productivity, as well as legal costs. All of which can impact shareholders
investments in the company. Poor labor relations may also pose diﬃculties in
recruiting new employees, a true challenge in this current labor market.
I would also like to note that since the time this proposal was ﬁled, the ending forced
arbitration, sexual assault and sexual harassment bill of 2021 was signed into law. The
title is self- explanatory. Though we applaud this bipartisan eﬀort, it does not go far
enough because it did not eliminate forced arbitration for claims of discrimination.
We believe it is in the company's best interest for the board to go beyond what
Congress has done and restore access to the courts for discrimination claims as well.
Thank you for your consideration.
{BIO 18885037 <GO>}

A - Kevin R. Johnsonhistory, Starbucks has set out to be a diﬀerent kind of company, one that puts people
ﬁrst, including our partners, our customers, and our communities. The company
embraces diversity and inclusion to create a workplace where partners can be
themselves. Discrimination, harassment, and retaliation have no place at Starbucks
and no partner is expected to tolerate such conduct. Starbucks board and
management are committed to maintaining a respectful workplace. Consistent with
that commitment, the company has established and regularly communicates the
process for reporting and promptly and thoroughly investigating claims of
discrimination, harassment, or retaliation.
The audit and compliance committee of our board of directors has responsibility for
overseeing the adequacy and eﬀectiveness of our legal regulatory and compliance
programs and regularly receives reports about harassment and discrimination
claims. Given our continuing commitment to create and maintain a respectful
workplace supported by our policies, partner training, and our board's ongoing
oversight, our board believes that issuing a public report with the information
contemplated by this proposal is not necessary. That concludes the matters to be
voted upon as outlined in the notice of annual meeting. In accordance with our
bylaws, I now hereby declare the polls for voting at our 2022 annual meeting closed.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have received the preliminary tabulation from Broadridge,
and based on that tabulation, I am pleased to report that all of the director nominees
were elected. Each of the management proposals was approved and the
shareholder proposal for annual reports regarding the prevention of harassment and
discrimination in the workplace was not approved. We will report the ﬁnal voting
results of today's meeting on our Form 8-K ﬁled with the SEC within four business
days of this meeting.
That concludes the formal business of the meeting and I now declare the annual
meeting of shareholders adjourned. I appreciate having the opportunity to join you
all today. We will now transition to the Q&A session, which will begin in a few
minutes.

moderator to handle the questions.
Thank you, Kevin. We did receive a lot of great questions for the group today. Many
were around similar themes. So we pulled the ones that were representative to make
sure we got everything covered. So our ﬁrst question today is for Rossann Williams.
Rossann, I understand the pandemic has made the business unpredictable, but I've
also noticed some stores in my area are closed in the middle of the day. What is
being done to address this?
{BIO 18658634 <GO>}
Well, all through the pandemic, our decision-making has prioritized one thing above
all else, and that is the health and wellbeing of our partners and our customers. We
leveraged analytics to understand how and when to make adjustments to best
support our stores and our communities. In fact, store managers in partnership with
their district managers have also been empowered to make decisions for their stores
based on their local environment, including reducing hours operating levels, and
yes, in some cases, closing stores temporarily. I appreciate your patience and I can
assure you we are working hard to get your store back open soon.
Thank you, Rossann. The next question is for John Culver, what is Starbucks doing to
reduce single-use packaging? What are you doing to reduce plastic use in your
stores?
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Well, ﬁrst oﬀ, thank you for the question. And shifting to reusable cups is a primary
strategy for us in achieving the planet positive goal to reduce waste by 50% by the
year 2030. But that's not just about cups, we also are remaining focused on
managing waste through more sustainable packaging solutions as well. Now we
shared some of the details with you today including our borrow-a-cup program and
our reusable cup eﬀorts. And our goals are very clear and that is to make choosing a
reusable cup as convenient as our customers expect for each and every visit,
whether that's in a cafe, a drive-through or through mobile order and pay. Our
commitment to sustainability is unwavering and we're working with all our partners
and throughout our stores to make this happen in markets across the world. Thanks
for the question.
Thank you, John. Michael Conway, a question for you. The company provides
frequent updates about the U.S. and China, how is the business in the rest of the
world? And what are the areas of growth your focused on ahead?

Page 27 of 29A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
A - Mellody Hobson
A - Unidentiﬁed SpeakerWell, there remains incredible runway for growth of the Starbucks brand outside of
the U.S. and China. Today across our international business, Starbucks serves
customers in 80 markets with more than 200,000 partners that proudly wear the
green apron in over 17,000 stores, most of these in partnership with our licensed
business operators. We're inspired by what we've learned, drive success in the U.S.
and China, and we partner closely with our licensees to adapt and apply these same
innovations to unlock more opportunity for growth across the markets we serve
around the world. These success drivers include innovative beverage platforms, and
elevated customer and store experience and personalized digital relationships.
And to deepen our digital relationships with customers, we're tapping into our
digital ﬂywheel to create customer loyalty through Starbucks rewards and
convenience features like mobile order and pay. For example, today in Southeast
Asia, we announced the partnership with Grab, the region's leading super app, to
provide customers with more ways to become Starbucks rewards members and
enjoy a seamlessly integrated Starbucks experience within the Grab ecosystem. With
more than half of Starbucks stores now outside of the U.S., we are optimistic for the
growth that our international markets will drive for Starbucks globally. Thank you for
the question.
Thank you, Michael. Mellody, question for you, a group of investors wrote to the
company urging Starbucks to take this opportunity to make a pivot towards
neutrality and supporting workers' rights to organize. Could you please comment on
the concern raised by these investors? Thank you.
{BIO 1953698 <GO>}
Thank you for the question. I want to start oﬀ by saying that for 50 years now, this
company has grown and succeeded by taking very seriously, all conversations, all
concerns that have been expressed to us at every level of the company and I assure
you that we're doing that now. And I also want to say in my day job, I run an
investment ﬁrm so I certainly value the shareholder voice. So I appreciate the outlook
-- outreach and so does the company. On the speciﬁc issue of neutrality, this one is
more nuanced. One would say, how could you be against neutrality? But neutrality in
its nuanced form limits our ability to speak to our partners in certain ways. And that
goes directly against the DNA of the company.
Now I'll be clear about the fact that we absolutely understand and recognize the
right of our partners to organize that is the American way. We are also negotiating in
good faith and we want a constructive relationship with the union. 50 years of
experience also shows us that by having a direct relationship with our partners,
we've been able to grow and succeed. So we appreciate the question, we're leaning
into the issue and we're working hard to make sure we hear the concerns that are
out there.
Thank you, Mellody. Rossann, question for you. What is being done to support the
employees that work in your stores? Will you continue raising their pay?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-16

Our total rewards approach, which includes our beneﬁts and compensation package
is our number one priority. In fact, we've been prioritizing investments in our partner
wage and their overall experience. And as an example, this year, we committed to an
additional $1 billion in wages and training. As another example, hourly pays
increased an average of 17% over the last 18 months. In fact, we expect our hourly
starting wage to be $15 to $23 per hour and we'll meet that this summer. This past
January, nearly 75% of our tenured partners also received seniority pay increases.
We're also improving our partner experience in the stores through the equipment
investments that you heard about earlier today. And we're also investing in
additional training. I'm very proud of our partners and we're going to continue to
prioritize and elevate their experience together.
Thank you, Rossann. Rachel, question for you. Can you help me understand why the
company would recommend against the shareholder proposal presented today?
{BIO 17980657 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you for the question. Starbucks has published and is deeply committed to
bold inclusion and diversity goals. Dennis Brockman discussed them earlier today,
and to be clear, harassment, discrimination, retaliation, has no place at Starbucks and
no partner should have to tolerate that. This shareholder proposal suggests that very
detailed public reporting on the resolution of workplace concerns might prevent
harassment and discrimination in the workplace; we disagree with that. We report on
these matters to our board and given our commitment and our eﬀorts to create a
respectful workplace, our board believes that issuing a public report of this nature as
contemplated by this particular shareholder proposal is not necessary and it will not
beneﬁt our partners or our shareholders.
Thank you, Rachel. Question for Rachel Ruggeri. What gives you conﬁdence that you
have the right pieces in place to grow long-term given what we're experiencing
today with the stock price?
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Thank you for the question. As I shared earlier today, we are conﬁdent in our growth
at scale agenda; it has and is serving us well. We also acknowledge that Starbucks is
operating in an industry that's currently facing pronounced headwinds including
inﬂation and labor shortages. However, throughout the pandemic, we've successfully
navigated our challenges, we delivered record revenue and earnings in ﬁscal 2021
while continuing to diﬀerentiate ourselves, supporting our partners and our
customers. So today we have plans to continue to navigate through these industry
headwinds and strengthen our leadership position. Our growth is not going to be
linear but we're conﬁdent in the underlying health of our business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-16

increased cases of COVID in the market, how is that impacting your performance in
China?
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Well, we're watching the developments closely and we have the beneﬁt of a broad
and diverse portfolio. Importantly, we continue to focus on the strategic areas of
growth in the market, that includes new stores, digital expansion, and even
innovation, and that gives us the conﬁdence over the long-term. As you know, we
don't comment inter-quarter on our performance or provide market-level guidance
