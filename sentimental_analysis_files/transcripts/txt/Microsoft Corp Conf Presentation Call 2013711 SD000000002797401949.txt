Communications. Sir, you may begin.
{BIO 19408024 <GO>}
Thank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. With me
today are Steve Ballmer, Chief Executive Oﬃcer. And the Microsoft senior leadership
team. We are glad that we have this time to share a little bit more of the thinking
behind the changes we are announcing. And what they mean for our future. And
with that, I'd like to turn it over to Steve who will make a few prepared remarks. After
that we will open it up for questions.
Steve?
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
Hi, thanks, everybody, for joining us today. And it is great to have a chance to chat
with you, along with our leadership team. This is certainly a big day for all of us.
During today's call, we thought it would be valuable to share with you some
additional context on the announcement. And then have a chance to take questions.
Over a year ago, we started a shift in our Business to a devices and services
company. Software development as a core asset, delivered through devices of our
own and our partners, as well as services. Since then, we've shipped a lot of great
products. We launched Windows 8, Surface, Windows Phone 8, Oﬃce 365. And we
very signiﬁcantly advanced Windows Azure. We brought a consistent user interface
to PCs, tablets, phones and the Xbox. And connected all of the content customers
care about in the cloud via SkyDrive, all while moving to continuous product cycles.
However, we are excited to deliver more. And to do it with even greater speed,
eﬃciency and capability. To do this, we really wanted to reﬁne both our mission and
the strategy that we've laid out. And then put in place the right structure to execute
against that mission. As we thought about our mission, we went back to what has
been our core mantra for the last 10-plus years -- to help people and businesses
throughout the world realize their full potential. That mission still drives us today.
And it is core to who all of us are.
So going forward, our strategy as a company will focus on creating a family of
devices and services, for individuals and for businesses, that empower people
around the globe at home, at work and on the go, for the activities they value most.
And I would underscore that -- activities people really value. That is at the heart and
soul of what it takes to help people realize their full potential. We are a company
who helps people get stuﬀ done, when it comes time to lean in. Even if it is for
serious fun, like Xbox, we are the company that delivers great high-value
experiences for work and for play. We are going to do this by leveraging our
strengths.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-07-11
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 12We've actually been in the business of thinking about devices for many, many, many
years. Really, in a sense, Windows is the deﬁnition of a device called the PC. And we
have had the great honor to be part of shepherding that forward for many years.
Xbox -- a product we've had in market for over 10 years. We've certainly focused in
on high-value experience through products like Oﬃce. And Skype, a more recent
acquisition, which focuses in on the moments in life that are most important and
most valuable. And we've certainly focused in on business and enterprise customers
as well, through products like Windows Server and Exchange.
The form of delivery of our value will shift to really thinking about devices and
services versus packaged software. But the focus in on the high-value activities in
people's lives will not change. The frontier of high-value scenarios that we enable
will continue to march outward. And we have strengths in proven capabilities on
which we will draw to deﬁne new experiences in expression, meeting, research,
tasks, the way corporate information gets managed and held securely. And much,
much more.
All of this means that we need to move forward as one Microsoft with one strategy
and one set of goals. We will have one approach to the marketplace, whether it is
business partners, innovation partners, developers, IT people, or consumers. We will
have one technology base to enable us in core areas, as opposed to two or more.
We are one Microsoft.
The next thing we will do is ensure that every discipline -- legal, ﬁnance, marketing,
business development, et cetera -- at Microsoft becomes stronger. And the best way
to get strength in each discipline is to pull them together. In the engineering area
speciﬁcally, the best way to get to one technical base, or one technology base, is to
make sure that we are pulling together things. And having people collaborate where
they need to, not duplicating eﬀorts. And of course, investing in very strong
engineering systems and tools. So we will pull together into fewer core engineering
groups. And we will pull together all of the other functions, all of the other
disciplines, under leaders who work for me directly.
In order to execute, then, on this One Microsoft strategy, we are organizing by
discipline and by engineering area. Of course, at the end of the day, we have to
deliver great products, a great family of devices and services. And experiences that
help people realize high-value activities. So we will have teams that function across
the Company and across engineering areas to deliver on a high-value experience or
device type, like Windows, which literally has engineering content already today
from our entire Company. And involvement from a variety of innovation partners. So
we have the notion today that teams work across the Company; that is fundamental.
But we will formalize, we will organize by discipline. And we will have product
champions who bring together our cross-company teams to deliver our core
products and high-value (scenarios).
Certainly the new organization structure introduces changes to many of our
employees. However, perhaps the larger change to each employee's experience
over time will be new ways of working. We have the most talented people in theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-07-11
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 12Frank Shawindustry. Their ideas, passion, focus and energy are paramount to us delivering
delightful new high-value experiences to the billion-plus people around the world
who are customers today. And the billions more we aspire to serve. To harness all of
that, we are moving forward and working in new ways.
With our employees today, we shared ﬁve characteristics that we want to embody in
each and every one of us. The ﬁrst is being nimble. In a world of continuous services,
the timeframe for product releases, customer interaction and competitive response
are dramatically shorter than ever before. And we need to make the right decisions.
And make them more quickly, balancing all the customer and business imperatives.
The next is communicative. In the new rapid-turn world, we need to communicate in
ways that don't just exchange information. But drive agility, action, ownership and
accountability.
The third is collaboration. That means the ability to coordinate eﬀectively with and
amongst our teams and disciplines to get results, build better products faster. And
drive customer and shareholder value.
The fourth is decisive. We have a clear strategic direction. We've laid it out -- One
Microsoft, focused in on a set of high-value experiences, delivered through devices
and services for businesses and consumers. But we need to now empower the
employees who are closest to the customers to make decisions in service of that
larger mission.
The last is motivation. Our employees are incredibly motivated by the real
opportunity we have to impact positively the lives of our customers -- when they are
doing the things that are most important. In our industry, every day brings more
opportunities than the day before. But we do have such an amazing opportunity to
make a diﬀerence in the lives of billions of people around the world. And that
motivates us in a signiﬁcant way. I'm thrilled when talented new hires tell me they
joined Microsoft to change the world. That is what we do today. And that's what we
are motivated to do tomorrow.
I hope this gives you a little greater perspective on where we are headed. And how
we will get there. As I said earlier, it's a big day for me. And the women and men
around the table who form the Microsoft leadership team. And we appreciate your
taking time from us. We are ready to take Microsoft in bold new directions. And really
delight both our consumer and business customers.
Thanks for your time. And we look forward to your questions.
{BIO 19408024 <GO>}
Thanks, Steve. We want to get as many questions as we can. So please stick to just
one question. And avoid long or multi-part questions. Operator, go ahead and
repeat your instructions.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-07-11

{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Thanks. Steve, if you could just discuss the impact to revenue and operating
expenses. I certainly understand in the near time it won't have a dramatic impact. But
how you think about this long term if your game plan plays out relative to the
revenue and operating expenses.
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
The key goal, of course, is to extend the impact we can have. And the eﬃcacy, the
innovation. And the breadth of footprint of innovation. Which is a real focus in on
innovation and the revenue and proﬁtability that goes with it. I will let Amy Hood, our
CFO, ﬁll in additionally.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I think that is right. As we've said, this is really about setting us up for long-term proﬁt
growth. And I look forward and believe that this best sets us up to do that.
Dina Bass, Bloomberg News.
{BIO 2507423 <GO>}
Steve, do you anticipate any job cuts as a result of this? For example, in the
marketing area, you used to have a central marketing group and then marketing in
the individual product units. Those are now being consolidated into one unit. Do you
expect that will result in redundancies?
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
We have no plans for layoﬀs. We certainly want to extend what we're doing. And we
will -- obviously, part of a reorganization is mapping people to new and expanded
needs. And we anticipate lots of opportunities to do that.

{BIO 19143062 <GO>}
Hi. I'm wondering how this reorg will be reﬂected in the ﬁnancial reporting. And
what will be the divisions in the earnings report when that's reported?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Hi, it's Amy again. Obviously, we have an earnings announcement next week. We will
be reporting using our current operating sections, as planned. Obviously, the
requirement over a period of time is to report your business in a way that the CEO
manages it. So as we go through this reorg and do the realignment, we will
obviously investigate any needed changes over time.
Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Hi, great, thank you. And congratulations on the announcement. Steve, I was
wondering if you could share with us a little bit on how this realignment might
enable you to change your go-to-market strategy on the device side of the business.
In particular, things like Surface. And your ability to maybe embrace the partner
channel a little bit more as a result. And maybe get involved in some bundled selling
with some of your existing oﬀerings like Oﬃce.
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
Perhaps I'll let Tami Reller lead oﬀ. And then Kevin Turner also give some comment.
{BIO 1978866 <GO>}
Thanks, Heather. This is Tami. I think that deﬁnitely behind this One marketing
strategy and organization that we have, we fundamentally believe we are just going
to be able to go to market much more eﬀectively in an integrated way. And I think
that is something that our partners, whether it is retail partners or the OEM partners
that we work so closely with, have been asking us to consider. It will help them be
more eﬃcient. And I think it will make us more eﬀective in the ﬁeld. And we think that
is something that will help our sellers, whether they are Microsoft employees or our
partners.
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
Yes. This is Kevin. On the ﬁrst-party hardware side, as well as the third-party hardware
side that we have, we are driving both changes in our go-to-market approach. We've
retransitioned some people, repurposed some people around device selling. And
we are also driving device quotas in addition to that -- something we haven't done in
the past. You are also seeing us do some strategic partnerships with the likes of Best
Buy and others, as well as our own stores, to be able to light up the scenarios and
the experience and really get the learnings ﬁrst-hand. So yes, we are really tuning theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-07-11

devices and services go-to-market.
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
Maybe just one other thing I will add. On the OEM front work, our work with HP, Dell,
Lenovo, I would say we have always had a very engaged relationship. But the level of
engagement continues to dial up. The level of innovation in their devices keeps
dialing up. Kevin and I were both just at our worldwide partner conference. Actually,
many of us were. We had a device bar, we call it, at the conference that had, I think,
105 diﬀerent devices from probably 15 diﬀerent manufacturers. And I think we are
starting to really see that shift from our partner base to a modern-looking device. It's
almost hard to call the new Windows devices PCs in all cases. They look so diﬀerent
that, quote, traditional PCs. But it is good to see Windows and our OEM partnerships
and devices with Intel processors changing so much. And adapting to the needs and
changes in the world.
Walter Pritchard, Citi Research.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Thanks. My question is actually a follow-up to what was just asked on devices. Steve,
you, even from your shareholder letter a year ago, talked about devices. And you
now have a whole group focused on it with a competent leader. And it just seems,
though, the footprint out in the market today is relatively minimal, especially versus
where it was ﬁve years ago. It hasn't changed a lot. And I'm wondering, as we think
forward to the next -- I think at (Lafayette) you've added Windows abstractly as part
of the device portfolio you have. As you look forward over the next three to ﬁve
years, can you talk about how we should expect to see that device portfolio expand?
I understand you're not going to pre-announce products. But just in an abstract
sense how we should think about areas of the business where the delivery may
include devices where it does not today. Thank you.
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
I think what we highlight in our communication with our folks is, whether it is the very
smallest or the very largest device, we need to ensure that we see innovation in our
operating system, in our partners' hardware. And in our own hardware to meet the
opportunities that we see in the market for quite a broad range of device types. And
with Xbox One coming to market here over the holiday season, with some of the
work we've done with Surface, with some of the work our partners Nokia has done
with the incredible line of Lumia phones, we certainly see an expanding breadth of
Windows devices quite dramatically. And I would say, expect to see it. I can tell you
one thing. If you want to have a knock down, gorgeous experience with an
enterprise customer, you show them our 82-inch Windows 8 tablet, sometimes
known as the PPI board. I don't fail to get every CEO who sees one to say -- get me
one in my oﬃce. And oh, by the way, we better get the devices, the phones, the
tablets, the PCs that work well with that. So you'll see us invest across a wide range
of device types, both ﬁrst party and third party.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-07-11

Hello, thanks so much. My question is, Steve, with Julie and Terry leading separate
hardware and software teams, how do you feel you can bring devices to the market
in a way that Apple and other competitors do? Will they work closely enough. And
collaboratively enough, to compete with Apple?
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
Yes, Julie and Terry will answer that.
{BIO 17409552 <GO>}
I think it is a perfect way for us to approach it. Terry and I have worked together for a
long time. We both have worked on the operating side, systems side. I've worked on
the hardware side. And it is a good blending of our skills and our teams to deliver
things together. So the structure that we are putting in place for the whole Company
is about working across the diﬀerent disciplines and having product champions. So
Terry and I will working to lead delivery to market of our ﬁrst-party and third-party
devices.
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
Yes. And maybe just also have Tony Bates add a little bit. Tony is going to have a
critical role running business development and evangelism from a role with our
hardware innovation partners, our OEMs. Tony?
{BIO 2499557 <GO>}
I would just add to that, as Julie alluded to this ﬁrst party but there's also third party.
And I think having a single, one, both interface to our key innovation partners. But,
two, bringing together the way we think about oﬀers without partners, is going to be
absolutely critical. So when we think about how we work together, I think it is going
back to one strategy, one team. So we are all going to be part of that and it is going
to be critical that we have that interface going forward.
And is Terry there?
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
Yes. There is innovative ideas coming from our OEM partners. And Julie's team has
some very innovative ideas. The platform needs to span from the PPI white board
that Tony talked about, to Xbox, to our phones. And beyond. And so it's exciting to
have all these hardware partners in the Windows ecosystem, or in the Microsoft
ecosystem. And all the innovative ideas. And to bring it to market together.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-07-11

{BIO 1514756 <GO>}
Hello, thanks for taking my call. I assume that under the applications and services
group, you have under that division consumer online services like Bing. And also the
Oﬃce stack, including Word, Excel, as well as the server-side of products like
SharePoint and Exchange. If you guys could comment on what the goal is there and
what you hope to accomplish with that particular product realignment.
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
Qi Lu will handle that one.
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks for the question. If you look at our strategy, the key focus is for Microsoft
to deliver scenarios to enable our users to pursue activities they value the most. The
new groups, the application services groups for Bing, as you mentioned, our mission
is always to help people not just ﬁnd information but complete tasks. Because when
people search, they always are doing research in a context of accomplishing a task.
They look at the Oﬃce. Its strong set of assets enable people to get more done.
Skyping, our new division, is a key asset to Lync, to connect all the people because
you do all these things always in context of collaborating, sharing with somebody
else. So from that perspective, the application services group's fundamental focus is
to use all those assets to truly deliver high-value scenarios, enable our users to
accomplish their goals doing things they value the most.
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
One other thing I would add is, one of the technologies we believe in very much is
machine learning. And we need to both develop more capabilities and serve our
users through our applications, as well as make machine learning basically a strong
service to support other developers. And maybe Satya can talk a little bit about
where we are going with the cloud and some of the things we are trying to do as we
learn from our own ﬁrst-party applications.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes. Our strategy, as far as the cloud goes, it all stems for this One strategy and
mission that the Company has. So if you look at our cloud footprint, in fact, it starts
with all of the ﬁrst-party applications, from Xbox Live to Bing to Oﬃce 365. So we
build the cloud infrastructure and our data center footprint in support of our ﬁrst-
party application. That not only battle tests our infrastructure, which then we provide
to our third parties, both as a public cloud service in Windows Azure, as well as our
server products. And our server products are increasingly getting better because of
that reinforcing cycle we have with our ﬁrst party. And machine learning is one set of
technologies that we learned in Bing. Now we are productizing as a set of servicesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-07-11

Edwin Chan, Reuters.
{BIO 15265279 <GO>}
Hello, thanks for take my question. There is a sense out there that this being a
growing level of, how do you say it, unproductive proliferation of red tape. And even
a little inﬁghting of past years that might have stiﬂed time-to-market for product. To
what extent was that a part of your thinking and planning this reorganization? And a
follow-up question to that, does this eﬀectively hand or direct control over the
process to Steve?
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
Let me maybe make a comment or two and then pass it to Lisa. We've spent, as a
leadership team, literally hundreds of hours over the last six months further
developing this notion of devices and services. What capabilities does the Company
need to really execute well? What capabilities do we need in engineering,
operations, sales? What is it in our business development function in order to reach
out more eﬀectively? How do we add depth to it? And we've really ﬂeshed out what
we are thinking about high-value activities, how do we really execute on it. Qi Lu
likes to say we have to be more like a football team -- that is, we all play a speciﬁc
position and we run every play together -- than we do like a baseball team where
athletes are oftentimes more individual in their orientation, if you will. From strategy
to execution, we have been driven on this thing. And I think that's quite important.
The truth of the matter is, a company this size doesn't run in any one person's brain.
And in a way, it's a much better way to run the Company because now every day we
have a whole group that is involved in the Company strategy, as opposed to just a
handful of people who are involved in the whole Company strategy. And I think it
let's us go stronger and deeper as a leadership team, frankly, than, let me say, our
old approach. I don't know if Lisa Brummel maybe wants to make a comment or two.
{BIO 5121094 <GO>}
Yes, I will just add that I think bureaucracy stems from people trying to translate how
they should work together. And when you have singular units, you have to put in a
lot of translation layer. As we go to one strategy and one team, there's a lot less
translation that needs to happen. And I think that's what you're going to see going
forward.

Thank you, hello. Does this mean that senior managers won't have direct proﬁt and
loss account responsibility that they might've had before? And if so, how are you
going to hold people accountable? What kind of measures are you going to use?
What kind of incentives and measures are actually going to make this new senior
management team work?
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
Suﬃce it to say, the level of accountability we all feel for the success of the Company
rises when we all have to look at the Company's integrated proﬁtability. I will let Amy
talk a little bit about the concepts. I won't go into speciﬁcs. But the concepts in terms
of how we are thinking. And there are pieces, obviously, that will have to have
attention. When it comes time to how we're doing with our consulting business,
which is a multi-billion dollar business that doesn't get discussed much, I think we're
all pretty clear. Kevin's on point, he thinks about it, he lives it, he eats it, he breathes
it, he sleeps it every day. And I sleep well knowing that. There will be pieces.
But I think the problem we've had, in a sense -- not the problem but the opportunity
we have is, if you subdivide the thing into too ﬁne a set of parts, you don't think
about your R&D investments as a general corporate resource that should be
repurposed and used very broadly. It is my resources, my business. And so this
notion, even from a P&L and resourcing perspective, of getting to a more One
Microsoft strategy, is very important. And yet we need to have strong ﬁnancial
accountability. Maybe Amy can talk about that.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes. I would not say that, I wouldn't necessarily associate this new org chart to any
reduction in accountability from a ﬁnancial perspective. I think we have always
thought about personal accountability around this table to product success. And I
think that will not change in the new organizational structure. Steve's used words like
that already. I think whether we call it accountability or a P&L or ﬁnancial
accountability, it will still remain just as it has in the past.
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
In fact, I believe we have, because of the focus on increasing discipline expertise,
particularly in the devices and services world, we have a basis to improve our
ﬁnancial accountability. Particularly in these new delivery formats, where, frankly, it is
diﬀerent to deliver something that has production cost, if you will, than it is software
which basically has no production cost. And we are going to get excellent at that.
And part of accountability and excellence is what drives us in this transformation.
