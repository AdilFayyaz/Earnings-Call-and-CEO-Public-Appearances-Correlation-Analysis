Presentation
All right. So we're going to get started here with Amazon.com. I'm Doug Anmuth,
the Internet analyst at Barclays Capital. It's our pleasure to have Amazon and Tom
Szkutak, CFO of Amazon since 2002. Prior to that, Tom spent 20 years with GE; he's
the CFO of GE Lighting, also in other various executive roles in GE Plastics and GE
Investments. So with that, we'll turn it over to Tom.
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning. This presentation may include some forward-looking
statements. For a full list of our risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent
10-Q and subsequent ﬁlings.
The agenda for this morning -- I'm going to talk about our results and our strategy.
Our ﬁnancial focus -- we focus on maximizing proﬁt dollars, not individual margins.
We optimize free cash ﬂow per share. And we think with our model, we'll have high
sustainable return on invested capital over time.
Here's a look at free cash ﬂow. If you look at the right hand side of this chart, you can
see the free cash ﬂow as of the end of Q3 on a trailing 12-month basis with $970
million. That's up 21% year-over-year. Again, our goal is to optimize free cash ﬂow per
share.
Here's a look at the pieces. I like to look at it this way so you can see the individual
pieces. You can see our GAAP operating income on the left. You can see two circles
in the middle of the page. You can see our change in Accounts Payable and change
in inventory. So as you can see from this slide, over the past 12 months, we've actually
generated cash from working capital. You see the $259 million.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2008-12-10
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 2 of 10Also, our reinvestment ratio -- or our CapEx versus depreciation is approximately
one. You can see that our CapEx is just over one -- $305 million versus $273 million
of depreciation. So again, you can see the leverage in earnings and working capital
while keeping our ﬁxed investment relatively ﬂat.
Here's a look at our operating cycle. As you can see from this slide, the way you'd
read this is we have approximately 29 days worth of inventory on hand. We have
several days' worth of receivables and we pay our suppliers, in this case, on an
average of 55 days. That means we have a negative operating cycle of 21 days. So
it's, again, as we grow, as I showed from the previous slide, working capital as a
source of cash.
Share count. We're eﬃciently managing dilution. If you look at the right hand side of
this chart, you can see shares -- stock-based awards outstanding plus common
shares outstanding total $448 million. That's up from $435 million. You can see the
history going back to 2003.
Net sales. Net sales over the past 12 months are $18.1 billion, up 38% year-over-year
or 33% on a local currency basis. And you can see the trend going back to 2003.
The way we look at our results -- we have two principal segments -- North American
and International. We also break out our sales between media, electronics and other
general merchandise and other. Other includes Amazon Enterprise Solutions, which
is where we power a third party website, Amazon Web Services, our co-branded
credit card. And other miscellaneous marketing agreements.
Here's what the mix looks like. If you look at the left hand side, it's a ﬁve-year look. So
if you look at the left hand side, you can see what our mix looked like back in 2003,
at the end of Q3, on a TTM basis versus where we are in the most recent quarter,
again on a TTM basis. If you look at the slide, you can see media with 78% of our
business ﬁve years ago. It was $3.7 billion. That media revenue grew from $3.7 billion
to just under $10.8 billion. But it declined as a % of our total revenue from 78 -- (70%)
to 59%.
You can see that our Electronics & Other General Merchandise grew from $951
million to $6.9 billion during the period, or grew from 20% of our total to 38% of our
total; so, again, becoming more diversiﬁed in the past ﬁve years.
If you take a look at the split by segment, this is what it looks like. Again, top half is
North America, bottom half is International. Top half you can see our North America
revenue, media revenue grew from just under $2.2 billion with 71% of our revenue
grew to $5.2 billion or 54% of our revenue. And EGM grew from $800 million to $4
billion during the period or 26% to 42% of our total.
And if you look down at the bottom half of the page, you see International. We were
really a media category business in International back in 2003; 92% of our revenue
came from media. We had $135 million of revenue back in 2003 in International. ThatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2008-12-10
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 3 of 10-- EGM grew from $135 million to $2.8 billion over the past ﬁve years; went from 8%
to approximately 33%. Even though our media business was 92% of our International
business, it has grown signiﬁcantly also from $1.5 billion to approximately $5.5 billion
during the period.
Here is another look at International sales. You can see from this slide, Q3 on a TTM
basis was up 43% or 32%, excluding impact from foreign exchange rates. This
represents our sales from our sites in UK, Germany, France, Japan and China. You
can see that it's 47% of our total revenue on a TTM basis as of Q3. It's growing. We
certainly could expect to see this greater than 50% over time.
We also ship to more than 200 countries. That comes from our various websites,
including North America as well.
Gross proﬁt. The bars are gross proﬁt dollars per lines of gross margin. You can see
that our gross proﬁt was just under $4.1 billion at the end of Q3 on a TTM basis.
That's up just over $1 billion from Q3 of '07. Again, our objective is to maximize gross
proﬁt dollars and on individual margins.
Here's a look at our Consolidated segment operating proﬁt -- same look. Again, the
bar chart is the dollars, the line of the percentages. Again, over the past 12 months,
our Consolidated segment operating income was just under $1.1 billion, up from $749
million a year ago.
Here's a snapshot of our balance sheet. As you can see from this chart, we have total
assets of just under $6.6 billion. We have cash and marketable securities of just over
$2.3 billion; inventory of $1.3 billion; return on inventory, approximately 12 times,
estimate of 12 to 12.4 range for a number of quarters. You can see our ﬁxed assets
are approximately $700 million.
You see the long-term debt and other, $895 million, approximately EUR240 million
of that is our remaining principal piece of corporate debt. It's our euro-denominated
debt that's due in 2010. And so you can see that we have I think a strong balance
sheet and we can see that the (amounts) demonstrating its eﬃciency.
Return on invested capital -- return on invested capital over the past 12 months,
again, is 32%. The way we calculate return on invested capital is conservative. We
take annual free cash ﬂow or trailing 12-month free cash ﬂow divided by total assets
minus current liabilities on a 5 point average basis. And again. So cash and
marketable securities, the $2.3 billion from the previous page is part of the
denominator -- whatever that cash balance on average was over the ﬁve quarter
period is part of the denominator.
So that's it for the results. What I have now is a number of slides around our strategy.
We want to be the earth's most customer-centered company. We always start with
the customer ﬁrst and work backward. We have three customer sets that I'm going toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2008-12-10
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 4 of 10talk about this morning. One is the consumer; one is sellers; and the other is
developers. I'll walk through each of those.
First, our virtuous cycle. And let me walk you through this; this is kind of busy. We
start with adding selection. This is how we think about our seller -- our consumer
business. We start with selection. We do a number of things to improve customer
experience and that drives traﬃc to our individual detail pages and to our website.
As traﬃc continues to increase, it becomes more attractive for third party sellers to
sell on our detail pages. Then as we grow, we're able to leverage our overall cost
structure and lower prices. And again, continue to invest in customer experience. We
have over 84 million active customer accounts, up 17% year-over-year.
There's a number of ways that we leverage our platform. I'm going to talk about a
few of those. We have Amazon.com, which is -- Amazon.com is a seller in each of our
marketplaces around the world. 69% of the units as of Q3 came from Amazon.com
as a seller. That's where we have our inventory on our product detail pages.
We also have a number of third party sellers. That's where it's the seller inventory on
our product detail pages. As of Q3, that was 31% of our units.
Then we have Amazon Enterprise Solutions or what we had called before, it was
merchant.com. Again, that's where we use our technology to power third party
websites.
Then we also have Amazon Web Services, where we have Web scale computing and
we have a number of simple APIs. Again, starting with taking technology that we've
used for ourself, leveraging it with sellers, using it for third parties. And developing
APIs for external use as well.
We think about our consumer customer experience pillars in three areas -- price,
selection. And convenience. Innovation is the foundation of each of these.
Pricing. Our objective is not to discount a small number of products for a limited
period of time. But to oﬀer low prices every day and apply them broadly across our
entire product range.
Selection. If you take a look at this slide, on the left hand side, you see our individual
product categories. And on the top, going across, you see our various country
websites. The dates that you see in the individual -- by the individual categories and
geographies are the dates that we launched those particular categories. So you can
see from this slide, there's still a lot of open white space. And the way you should
think about it is those are opportunities for the future.
There's still a very large opportunity, we think, in adding selection in the existing
categories that we're in today -- even the ones that we launched back in mid to late-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2008-12-10
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 5 of 10'90s. We're still adding selection to those individual categories.
We think there's opportunity to add more geographies over time. And we also think
there's opportunities to add categories that are not on this page. So again, from a
selection standpoint, as we think about growth -- add more geographies; add
selection within the categories that we're in; add new categories with geographies
that we don't have today; and add categories that are not on this page. So again, a
large amount of room for -- to add selection.
There's a number of diﬀerent ways that we add convenience for customers. I'm just
going to walk through a few examples. This happens to be Amazon Prime. The way
Amazon Prime works is you -- we have this in a number of geographies, as I'll show
you in a few minutes -- but we charge a fee and then we have unlimited, express
two-day shipping.
So if you're a customer in the US, you can share it with a few family members, the
actual subscription. Then you can ship product to anywhere in the US for free
express two-day. So that's the way it works. Then you can also ship next day for $3.99.
So again, it's a great convenience for customers.
If you take a look at this slide, you can see -- on the left hand side, you can see the
individual geographies that we're in. You can see that we have a prime subscription
membership program in most of the geographies. We do not have it in Canada or
China, not yet today. But we do oﬀer free shipping in all of our geographies. And if
you look closely, you can see the annual fees, the dates they were launched -- and in
this case, prime -- and what the oﬀering is.
So again, we have two-day free shipping in the US. We have free one-day shipping in
UK and Germany. We have free expedited either same or next day in Japan. And
recently launched free one-day delivery in France.
One of the other convenience items we're oﬀering is frustration-free packaging. We
have a number -- we're working with a number of suppliers to oﬀer this. And again,
it's a way to oﬀer, in this case, the toy category to get rid of a lot of the frustration-
free packaging. That's also, obviously, much more economically -- excuse me,
environmentally-sensitive. And so we think this is a great convenience for customers.
And it's something that we're very proud to be working on.
Another convenience segment -- we have a separately branded website called
Endless. It's our shoe and hand bag website. It has some very special features to it. If
you haven't been on it, I encourage you to take a look at it. We oﬀer overnight
shipping for free on the separately branded website and free returns. And again, it's
a very interesting site for our shoes and it's speciﬁcally designed for shoes and hand
bags. We've had this launched in the US for some time. And we launched recently in
Japan.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2008-12-10
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 6 of 10Kindle. We have a number of diﬀerent digital oﬀerings. Kindle is our digital text
oﬀering. And we're excited with the progress that we've had so far with Kindle. And
again, it's a wireless reading device. And you can get many, many diﬀerent books,
magazines. And newspapers delivered electronically in under 60 seconds, right at
your ﬁngertips.
One of our other digital oﬀerings is MP3 downloads. We just recently announced
that we've launched that in UK in addition to our US website.
Video on Demand is another oﬀering that we have. Again, one of the things that
we're trying to improve from a customer experience standpoint is -- we oﬀer great
selections, great pricing; how do we get product to customers now, for those
customers that really wanted to get product now? And so, with Kindle, you can get
books, magazines and newspapers almost instantaneously. The same thing with MP3
and Video on Demand.
Holiday toy list. This is an interesting feature. I encourage you to go on and look at it.
It's just an adaptive way to look at a holiday toy list. And again, it's a convenience for
customers. And probably the best way to see this is to actually go on the site and
take a look at it.
So that's consumers. What I thought I'd do now is spend a few minutes talking about
sellers.
This is a screenshot from one of our detailed pages on our website. You can see that
it's a Blu-ray disk player. If you look closely, you can see the circle on the right hand
side, you can see that it's oﬀered from a merchant other than Amazon.com. So this
would be if a unit sold through this particular detail page, it will be one of the 31% of
total units that we added in Q3.
And the way this works is, we call this particular seller -- won the buy box. And what
we allow branded sellers to do is if they have the best pricing and the best
availability, we allow them to win that buy box. And what that means is they're shown
prominently ﬁrst in the buy box, as you can see, in that blue box on the top right
hand side.
There's also more buying choices listed below if you happen to want to buy it from a
diﬀerent seller. So again, it's a feature; it's a marketplace, a competitive marketplace
on our detailed pages. And in this particular case, this particular seller had the best
pricing and availability.
We like this because there's certainly times where you might have a seller that has --
it's a great way to add selection. It's also a great way for customers to show that it's
an incredibly competitive marketplace. So they can choose who they want to buy
from. From time to time, you'll have sellers that may have excess inventory; they
might be deeply discounting a particular oﬀer. We're very happy to have them sellFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2008-12-10
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 7 of 10that product on our detailed pages and earn a commission on it. We have over 1.4
million active sellers, which is up 17% year-over-year.
So this is a slide on our sellers. As you can see -- and also the lines are the
percentage of total units. As I mentioned, we have over 1.4 million active sellers.
That's up from over 1.2 million last year. And you can see the trend back to 2004.
There's a number of diﬀerent things we're doing to try to improve the seller
experience. And this just happens to be one example -- it's called Fulﬁlled by
Amazon. It's pretty simple in concept. The way it works is we have sellers who we will
do fulﬁllment for. They ship in bulk to us. And we will provide fulﬁllment for those
sellers and for those customers.
And so, the advantage from a seller perspective is they get to take advantage of our
multi-node Fulﬁllment network. If you go on our website. And you were to ﬁnd --
you'll ﬁnd a number of these. And you'll see them shown as -- there's a little box that
says Fulﬁlled by Amazon. So the customer knows that it's something that we're
taking care of the fulﬁllment for.
The beneﬁt to the seller is they get to oﬄoad that activity to us. They also get the
beneﬁt of participating in our various shipping programs. For example, free Super
Saver Shipping will be available on these items. Amazon Prime, Express two-day
delivery will be available on these items. And so it's a great way from a customer
standpoint to get more selection, additional selection that's available on Amazon to
be part of the Prime and free shipping programs. And it's great for sellers as well. So
we think it's great for investors, great for sellers. And great for customers.
Amazon Enterprise Solutions -- we have a number of examples. And I show a few
examples on this slide, where we actually power third party websites today using our
technology. So it's a great way for us to take advantage of the technology that we've
developed and oﬀer it to others to monetize that.
Checkout by Amazon. We have certainly improved and have great capabilities from
a payments perspective on our website. And we're oﬀering those services externally
as well for third party providers.
Amazon Web Services. The way we think about Amazon Web Services is we take --
it's a great way to take -- develop and take their idea; they can oﬄoad the
undiﬀerentiated heavy lifting, if you will, which we'll do for them. And that's work that
we're doing for ourselves anyway, to lead to a successful product.
We have a number of diﬀerent Web services. This just happens to be a list of the
ones that we have.
In summary, we have -- certainly we think that the online model is advantaged. We
face many challenges and many opportunities. But we're relentlessly improving theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2008-12-10

A - Tom Szkutakcustomer experience for our three customer sets -- consumers, sellers. And
developers.
We're leveraging the platform wherever we can. The examples I gave around
leveraging the technology for ourselves versus retailer for sellers -- powering third
party websites and Web services. We think we're well-positioned for growth. And
we're focused on optimizing long-term free cash ﬂow per share. And innovation is
the foundation of everything that we do.
Thanks for listening. I think we have a few minutes for questions.
Questions And Answers
Great. All right. I'll kick it oﬀ. Tom, you talked a lot about free cash ﬂow. And so, I
guess in particular, thinking about the working capital beneﬁts during this time,
where we were expecting the top line to just slow somewhat. And then grow in
obviously CapEx as well, putting some pressure on those beneﬁts. The question is,
do you see any structural change there in terms of the working capital cycle, where
suppliers are looking for payments any sooner in this environment? And is it
reasonable to think that working capital beneﬁts come right back as your sales do
when we come out of this environment? Thanks.
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
The question was again around working capital -- do we think there's any major
changes?
I think -- structurally, I think over time, the working capital beneﬁt that we get or the
negative operating cycle is going to be with us. Certainly, you see some diﬀerences
by category. Certainly, there's some categories that have larger -- it's similar to the
gross margin discussions that we've had in the past; just some categories have
higher gross margin, lower gross margin.
Same thing with operating cycles. Some have higher and lower operating cycles. But
to answer your question, I think certainly over time, we think that this is a structural
beneﬁt.
And it's really around the biggest beneﬁt is because we turn our inventory so
quickly. We have the beneﬁt of when you're turning your inventory 12 times, while
adding a lot of selection and getting very deep in selection and improving in-stock
levels, it will turn it that quickly. That's really where the beneﬁt comes into play.
And so, whereas physical world retailers, you have to have -- if you have 500 stores,
for example, across the country, to have good in-stocks, you have to have good in-
stock to 500 stores. We're able to keep that inventory in a smaller number ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2008-12-10

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Tom Szkutaklocations. And we turn it very quickly. So that's where the advantage comes in, in the
operating cycle.
Can you just talk a little bit about the Fulﬁllment business? And what the trends are
there and whether or not you've seen improvements or rather issues with holding
more inventory for your customers?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
Yes. We think it's a -- your question was around the Fulﬁllment business, Fulﬁlled by
Amazon. And how we are seeing the trends. We're actually very happy with the
trends that we've seen. And we published, at the end of Q3, the units associated with
that, if you can go back to our release and take a look at the exact details of that.
It's still a very early program for us. It's something that we think a number of years
out and what it would look like. But we think oﬀering our multi-node Fulﬁllment
network to sellers so that sellers can concentrate on procuring product and making
sure that they -- all the things that they need to do on their side while oﬄoading that
to us will be a beneﬁt.
It won't be for everybody, certainly. But if you think about a seller that's selling on a
website today, then they get the opportunity to participate in our free shipping
program, it's just a great beneﬁt to them in addition to knowing that -- having a
customer know that we're the ones providing the fulﬁllment. So I think it's just a -- it's
early. But it's something we ﬁnd interesting and we think we're hopeful that it will be
big for us over time.
Other questions?
All right. Could you talk a little bit about the payment product, the Checkout by
Amazon? What kind of success you're seeing in terms of adoption both by
customers and third party vendors?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
Right. It's another one that's -- again, we have a few oﬀerings there. Those are, again,
very, very early. But again, the thought around it is -- it takes a lot of time on various
websites and you have to have a really secure environment, which we do, to put in all
your credentials. And so it's a great way to use our product and leverage what we've
worked on for, really, since inception. And have third parties use that payment
product.
So it's extremely early. And we'll have to see how it works out. But we like what we
see so far. And again -- but it's very early.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2008-12-10

questions? Okay. Thank you very much. Oh, one more question.
Have there been any changes in renewal rates for prime in tougher economic times?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
That's a good -- it's a good question. We're certainly -- we'll be monitoring it as we
go. Right now the renewal rates are very high and we'll monitor it as we go. But it's
something that -- our ﬁnding is, it's such a great convenience for customers, in
addition to -- just once a customer is a prime member and starts getting things
express two-day for free, it is something that's very diﬃcult to get oﬀ of once the
customer is doing it, because it's just a great service. So it's something that we're
monitoring very carefully. But the renewal rates are good.
So thanks for the questions -- great questions.
