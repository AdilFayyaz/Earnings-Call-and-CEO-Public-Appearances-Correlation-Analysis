Good morning. Let me welcome everyone. It's my pleasure you to introduce Colette
Kress, who is the Chief Financial Oﬃcer of NVIDIA. We've got a ﬁreside chat for
about the next 30 minutes. It's a pretty informal setting. We do have a mic that's
traveling around the room, so if you do have a question, don't be shy, please raise
your hand, and we'll get a mic to you.
And with that, Colette, ﬁrst and foremost, thank you. I appreciate you coming down
to the conference this year and supporting our eﬀort. I always ﬁnd it kind of helpful
in a ﬁreside chat to make the ﬁrst question a little bit more of an open question to
allow you to kind of position NVIDIA to the room, kind of what's the core IP, but more
importantly, what's the strategy to leverage that core IP into end-markets and drive
the investment thesis for everyone in the audience?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So let me start with reminding everyone that we're a company focused on
accelerated computing and accelerated computing hits each and every single one
of our market platforms from gaming, to ProViz, to data center, to automotive. Each
one of those market platforms is very diverse and really has a big and expanding
overall market, each at diﬀerent stages, though. We just ﬁnished our Q3 results just
about a month ago, where we are focused on continuing a great quarter and
sequential growth. Our growth rate sequentially was about 17%, slightly down year-
over-year and we set the stage for overall gaming business for great growth into Q3
in preparation of the holiday.
Our overall ray tracing technology is doing quite well. The adoption is broad and
wide. And then, our data center business, we took this opportunity to return to
growth in our hyperscale business. Our hyperscalers are now growing sequentially
as well as year-over-year. We are pleased with our results for Q3, both in our gross
margins as well as our overall operating margins that we have done. Our gross
margins had sequential growth and year-over-year growth, pushing in upwards ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

Colette M. Kress64%, largely inﬂuenced by mix, our growth in terms of sequentially gaming and our
overall data center.
That's a helpful start. I'd like to kind of structure the conversation by just kind of
walking through all of your major end-markets by size. So maybe we can start on the
gaming front. And as you pointed out, your October quarter was an exceptionally
strong quarter. I think the two things that you really highlighted as driving demand
were may be mobile, on the notebook side and also the console side. Maybe talk a
little bit about the notebook side and I think that's kind of a really strong story for
NVIDIA. With the Max-Q technology, you've signiﬁcantly increased the number of
SKUs. How do we think about where we are in that mobile -- in the notebook cycle
and how do we think about longer-term growth for notebooks?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So our gaming business continues to be a growth driver for us. We've been in
the business for many years, continuing to impress our overall gaming with new
technology, new innovation to bring to market. Just about a year ago, it was a time
that we brought forth overall ray tracing. Ray tracing is what we look at to be the next
generation of overall gaming and what has traditionally been done just with the use
of overall GPUs and inferring the overall ray tracing we can now do it in overall real-
time.
The overall graphic improvement that you see from ray tracing is extremely strong.
We have the entire market, now, an ecosystem focused on in terms of ray tracing.
And then, just in years' time, we have announced NAV [ph], brought to market
probably more than couple dozen games for this market, including overall Minecraft,
one of the top selling games in the market, will be coming with ray tracing, but also
Cyberpunk and a whole host of other ones.
But this has not only inﬂuenced our overall desktop business, but it has also
inﬂuenced what we see in terms of our overall notebook business. The ability for us
to be mobile in terms of gaming and have that exact same experience in terms of
performance of what you have in the desktop is really important to our overall
gamers. They use this as an opportunity to not only use the overall desktop, but have
an equally performing overall notebook or people just entering the market that
don't want to have a self-built overall desktop. Our overall ability to bring to market a
130 diﬀerent laptops that not only have high-end gaming but allow you to carry with
it the overall thin and light capabilities. That's the underpinnings of the overall Max-
Q technology. What this is, as people weren't willing to go back and say, I want a
heavy or I want a very large overall laptop, I wanted the overall mobility, but they also
wanted the overall strong performance.
So we're set-up right now for the holiday season with a great lineup of overall
laptops across the industry and across every single industry and we're really excited
to bring this to market.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

Unidentiﬁed ParticipantColette, this might seem like an odd question, given some of the skepticism you've
heard from investors about the adoption of ray tracing, especially in the ﬁrst half of
the year, but correct me if I'm wrong, the RTX product is already two-thirds of your
desktop sort of GPU business. Where are we in that cycle and how much more legs
does this have on the RTX side?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah, it's correct that overall, our ray-traced overall boards that we sell in desktop
two-thirds of it is now with overall ray tracing. So we're really pleased with the market
adoption of it and of course there is absolutely more room to grow. We have cards
that ﬁt every single type of price point as well as every single type of overall gamer.
So you can overall buy a card in the $100 and well, it's all the way up to $1,000 to
participate in overall ray tracing. The way we see it in the future ray tracing will be the
underpinnings of gaming and PC gaming. So I think we're just in the initial stages
and the amount of ray tracing that we'll see in the future, not only for PC gaming,
consoles and others, we'll continue to fuel the overall gaming market.
Well, good. Seasonality is always a tricky word, especially when you've got
businesses that have such strong secular drivers like gaming, but you did sort of
guide the January quarter on gaming at least qualitatively to have some seasonality
in it. When I go back and look at the last ﬁve years, four out of those ﬁve years,
actually gaming was up sequentially in the January quarter. The only year it was
down was '19 and I would argue you were going through a fairly severe inventory
correction around crypto. So how should we think about seasonality in this business
and it's become more seasonal as notebook and console becomes a bigger part of
that revenue?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah, exactly. When you think about our overall gaming business, there is several
diﬀerent parts. There is our desktop, there is our notebook, there is our overall
consoles. From our overall console picture, we've articulated that generally the
stronger quarters will build ahead of the overall holiday take place in Q2 and Q3. In
the case of overall notebooks, same, you'll see in terms of larger-build particularly in
Q2 and Q3 as they gear up for the overall holiday season. Now, given our great
growth rate that we're seeing in the overall notebooks, we're now having a larger
seasonal expectation inﬂuenced by the overall notebooks. Our notebooks are
approaching close to one-third of our overall gaming business. Now, when we look
at our Q3 to Q4, yes, we'll have the same type of seasonality that we've seen in
history for desktop. We expect our desktop to grow sequentially between Q3 and
Q4.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

Colette M. KressThat's helpful. And then some idiosyncratic issues in the near-term, one, in terms of
having some supply issues, help us understand how that may or may not be
aﬀecting your business, and two, just China-US trade, do you see any impact with the
gaming because of that dynamic?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. In the case of the overall CPU shortages, we're probably going on about a year
of talks of CPU shortage pieces. I'm going to remind in terms of where we are in
both desktop and our notebook, we tend to be in more high-end types of systems.
We ﬁnd that our OEMs generally target more about high-end as well. So we haven't
seen any real impact this last quarter from overall CPU shortages. Going into Q4,
we've taken into account what we know and is incorporated in our guidance as well.
And then, the other dynamic kind of in the near term is exiting the October quarter.
You just started shipping some new product within this segment, name the GTX 1660
and GTX 1665 [ph], you've also got the SHIELD TV and the SHIELD TV Pro. How does
that inﬂuence kind of your view of seasonality going into the January quarter?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. So our new products in terms of the GTX 1600 SUPER are deﬁnitely
incorporated into our outlook and we'll look in terms of those being built to be
available into the market for both the holiday season and holiday season extension,
because remember the holiday season probably starts at this time in November and
extends in terms of the ﬁrst couple of months of next year as we move into the Asia-
Pac area as well.
Our SHIELD products, we're excited they have gotten some tremendous reviews as
probably the best streaming product that you can buy for the holiday season, so
we're excited about that market and to see what it will show in terms of the end of
the quarter.
This year, you saw more investor interest in cloud gaming probably mostly around
the Google Stadia announcement, which actually you're not involved in, but -- can
you talk a little bit about sort of your view of cloud gaming? Is this something that's
here now ready to go? Is it complementary to this business? Is it accretive to the
business? Is it dilutive and kind of what's your strategy, because you seem to pairing
up more with the service providers. And that's -- you've got, I think, projects in
Taiwan, Russia, Japan with SoftBank and then Korea. So what is your strategy to
attack this market?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 11Unidentiﬁed Participant
Colette M. KressYeah, so the gaming market is certainly not new to us and we look at the overall
streaming opportunity as absolutely something that will be here in the future, but we
wanted to make sure we did this right based on the so many years of working
together with the overall ecosystem, whether that'd be game engine or whether
that'd be the overall game developers and the building of the overall software. We
have the ability to be that underlying infrastructure, whether that's going to be in a
desktop, whether that's going to be in a notebook or if it's going to be back in terms
of data center to where people want to stream that.
Our approach has been, bring your own game with it, we can play with any
infrastructure that has been enabled using our overall streaming service that we have
put together. It allows us to keep our great collaboration and partnership with the
overall ecosystem and to be open to all the diﬀerent types of games out there. Many
of the others that are approaching the overall streaming market maybe have just a
couple of games ready to go to market. We have hundreds and we'll continue to
have more and more games approach and more actually approaching this market.
We are looking at the streaming as an opportunity to address a market that has not
been addressed yet. Are you willing to have a full desktop that you have created, are
you willing to go and buy an overall notebook? Probably, but maybe you also want
the social aspects of gaming that no matter where you are, you have the ability to
overall stream. That is what our GeForce NOW overall streaming service allows us.
Working with the overall telcos, there's many areas where the broadband will be the
next key place for a killer app, such as overall gaming for them to overall host. So
we're excited about our relationships in terms of creating new telco opportunities,
but also keeping the great connection that we have with our existing gaming
ecosystem.
A year ago, there was a lot of sort of noise around crypto and I think even for you on
the inside looking in, it was diﬃcult to kind of quantify the full impact of crypto as it
was happening. You've seen tremendous growth in gaming oﬀ the bottom, but
you're still about $150 million below kind of your peak quarter from last year. How do
we think about the long-term growth rate in gaming and how do we think about the
mix between units and ASPs, because this is really been a really strong and
powerfully ASP story for the Company over the last ﬁve, six, seven years?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. So, the overall gaming industry is a very strong entertainment market. It has
advanced tremendously over the last ﬁve to be more of a social tool that allows
people to stay connected and enjoy the games that they want. We see this for the
long-term being as innovative as we have with the introduction of ray tracing, we'll
continue to be able to overall grow that market. ASPs are important, but remember,
we also keep a portfolio of a card for any type of gamer. It doesn't -- this isn't an
industry that we want only the high end. We want to be able to bring anyone who is
interested in gaming into this market. What we have seen is the gamers are starting
in their teens and are staying well past the age of 40. What that means is, there'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

get the best of the best. And choosing NVIDIA, we've continued to hold that high-
end part of the market, which is so important because those are the ones that are
helping us design what we believe, is the future of gaming as well.
Switching gears to the data center business, sitting at about 25% of revenue, as you
pointed out, you had a very strong October quarter above your expectations, you
grew about 11% sequentially. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about where you
think we are and what's been sort of a digestion of capacity from the end of last year
and why we're starting to see this uptick now, and as you address the question, I
think it's important to discuss maybe the impact of conversational AI and natural
language processing on this business currently, and going forward?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Absolutely. So, our data center business, yet another tool to bring accelerated
computing to the workloads in the overall data center as well as on the Edge, we've
seen tremendous wave of overall acceleration as well as AI over the last ﬁve years.
We are now approaching a new wave that is focused on conversational AI.
Conversational AI is just a new way, new technique to actually deal with the natural
language processing.
Much of our overall search queries, most of our speech is looking for ways to
understand word-by-word as well as the words that are connected together on what
do they mean and interpret it and try and interpret in terms of what you are looking
for in a question-and-answer type of period. This is a new wave of conversational AI.
With natural language processing, it is an expansion of the market tremendously.
The overall size of the data sets, the size of the neural nets are much more complex,
much more bigger and is fueling a new wave of both training as well as inﬂuencing
in terms of both of these. We're pleased to see both the V100 as well as the T4 to
take place on this. This is expanding farther than just the overall hyperscales. We see
that the overall consumer internet companies, we see startup AIs using these types
of techniques on natural language processing. Rendering engines are also very, very
important now. They tell us what to potentially read, potentially where to shop, what
to shop for. These are also new techniques in AI that are very focused on right now.
We've seen a surge of interest in this area and I think we're just in the early stages of
this to take place for the future as well.
In our Q3 results, although we didn't have year-over-year growth, we returned to
year-over-year growth in terms of overall hyperscales. When we gave our guidance
for Q4 in terms of data center as well, we also believe we'll have a strong growth and
probably accelerated growth, faster than what we had with Q3.
That's an important point, because you were asked this question on the call and the
answer wasn't quite clear. You're being much more speciﬁc because when youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

Colette M. Kressguided for the October quarter, you were positive on data center, but somewhat
subdued positive and you came in better than I think the qualitative guidance. So
you're actually saying that the 11% sequential growth you saw in Q3 -- sorry, in your
October quarter, could actually accelerate into the January quarter.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
That is correct. We're expecting an accelerated growth between Q3 and Q4 in our
data center business.
And you also brought up a really -- another really interesting point, because I think
that everybody understands you're dominant position in training. There's always
been a question mark as to whether or not a GPU is a good device to use in
inference. And as you pointed out, I think T4 volumes in the October quarter were
actually higher than the V100, even though V100 was at record levels. Is your view of
your participation in inference changing and can you help us put some numbers
around it?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So, our T4 is one of our key products that inﬂuences overall inferencing
workload out there. Yes, so V100 and our T4 hit record levels in Q3 and our T4
volumes were higher than our V100, just a tremendous ﬁt for us as we now see
inferencing clearly in our double-digit percent of our overall data center revenue.
Now, given that it does have a diﬀerent overall ASP price point that is solidly landed,
and you're right, an area where people said, would you need an overall GPU for
inferencing. Conversational AI is just one overall workload case, a very complex one
that requires multiple stages as well as a response time that's in the hundreds of
milliseconds in terms of response. Not only the overall programmability of a T4 is
necessary, but also the performance. You've even seen us participant in MLPerf 0.5,
which allowed us to enter into the overall benchmarking of overall inferencing. We
were the only participant that actually chose to enter into every single overall
category and we won every single category. Many of our overall competitors didn't
even ﬁle to overall compete in the overall competition. So not only is T4 able to do
overall inferencing, it is being used for inferencing and I think we're just in the early
stages of a very big market going forward.
So should we expect that at the next Analyst Day that your market opportunity set for
inference goes up year-over-year?

Colette M. Kress
Unidentiﬁed ParticipantWe're going to continue to work on our overall TAM projections and we'll save that
great discussion for Analyst Day.
And you've also had a busy sort of last few months of new product introductions in
this area and I'll reference, Mobile World LA, where you came out with I think two
kind of interesting products. First was GPU acceleration for 5G wireless RAN. The
second was sort of your NVIDIA EGX product for the Intelligent Edge. Can you talk a
little bit about the market opportunity for both? And, on the EGX product, is this
again your way to try to get as more as dominant position on inference in the
marketplace?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Our position in terms of Edge Computing is yet another important market for us to
consider. We've talked about the overall cloud instances that have been available
not only for both the hyperscalers use, but many of our overall startups, the high-
performance computing market. Additionally, when we think about individually the
industries that may leverage the overall cloud or leverage an overall hybrid
experience, an important new area is overall edge computing. This can be anything
from what you will see in terms of an Edge device, such as a drone, such as a robot,
that must be autonomous as well as one of our most favorite type of -- Edge type of
computing, which will be AV cars. But, additionally, the amount that will partake
outside of the overall data center with an overall Edge server that either can
consolidate many of those devices that are together and draw overall inference from
those is a very big market, probably in a good size with the overall inferencing
market as well.
So, we announced both our partnership with Microsoft in terms of an Edge server,
but you're correct, we also announced with overall 5G RAN, again, focused in terms
of on the Edge data center consolidating that back into it and in place to do a
software-deﬁned 5G versus the older traditional methods. We believe this is an
important area to think about acceleration, not just with the GPU, but all of the
diﬀerent areas of the overall server or the overall infrastructure as a whole.
Switching from applications in the data center to kind of customers, you guys have
always done well in hyperscale both in the cloud and in their own needs. Enterprise
is a growing new market for you, what you call your vertical markets, but it's not
necessarily a traditional market that NVIDIA has been involved with and I'm kind of
curious as you're really trying to exploit the opportunity in enterprise, how much
channel work needs to be done? How much OpEx does that imply and as you think
about all the diﬀerent verticals within that segment of the enterprise, are they fairly
discrete manufacturing, versus retail, versus ﬁnance or is there a leveragable kind of
R&D and OpEx that you can use to go after all of them?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

Yeah, this is a good question to help understand our vertical industries and our play
into this market. Over this last year as we have seen the focus of some of the
digestion in the data center, we've been busy at work focused on many of these
vertical industries. Our overall channel is still the same, whether it'd be the
hyperscalers or whether it'd be the enterprisers, whether they buy directly to -- from
us or buy in any of the overall OEM or ODM server overall oﬀerings. So that go-to
market is still the same, but our focus has been on the verticals and focus in terms of
both the applications that the vertical use, accelerating those applications and
working in terms of with CUDA and with an overall platform on top of CUDA that
enables those speciﬁc industry applications to be accelerated one by one, where we
see very large market or very large use. You've seen us focus in terms of an area of
retail and e-tail. You can extend that to manufacturing our supply chain, where folks
are interested in the data analytics to how to better run both their supply chain,
better the overall inventory management, their overall demand and supply overall
planning.
Walmart has been a very key overall customer in there. You can look at a customers
such as the US Postal Service as well. How can I better sort through the overall
amount? We have that focus in terms of the ﬁnancial industry, we have that focus in
terms of high-performance computing, you've seen us in terms of in design and
creative apps as well, focus. So industry-by-industry, the focus is not just on the
performance of the chip, which is a table stake that we need to have that
performance, but our programmability, our ability to stitch together with the
applications that they use, allow us to reach this market.
And if you look at the traditional server market, it's still mostly an enterprise market,
the hyperscale space, while growing faster, is still a smaller portion. As you think
about AI over time, help us kind of quantify the enterprise opportunity versus the
hyperscale opportunity?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I believe the overall industry, the overall inference and the overall -- it will likely be
larger opportunities in total over the long term. Now, when do we reach that point
that they are that much larger? We'll just have to say. We've seen waves of our
overall AI. Are we on our second to third wave as we're focusing now on this natural
language processing section? Probably. Will there be more waves in the future?
Absolutely.
You've been emphasizing kind of the software IP you bring to the table. Maybe de-
emphasizing a little bit the silicon IP, but I'm a semiconductor analyst and there was
Supercomputer 2019 recently and I think there was some expectations/ hope thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

Colette M. Kressmaybe we'd get a better understanding of your silicon roadmap to 7-nanometer,
which we didn't do. When can we expect that and I guess, more importantly, how
important is process technology to the overall solution that you bring to your
customers?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We are always busy at work, building our overall architectures, whether that'd be our
architectures as a whole and it tends to serve many of our diﬀerent markets, whether
that'd be gaming, or ProViz, or overall data center. So fear not, we're working on our
technology. Our innovations and our process technology has been exceptional over
those last years. So, stay tuned. We will always have something for you in the future,
but we'd like to surprise everybody with our overall roadmaps and when things
come out.
Now, the focus in terms of what is more important, the overall processing and the
overall development in software. We see a lot of people focused on in PowerPoint is
trying to compete with our overall performance that we see in our overall
processors. Our processors not only have been top notch, no matter what industry
that they've been, there is still continuous improvement that we can do, both at the
current node or in terms of their future.
For every single one of our architectures, we continue to, in the development cycle,
choose the existing node or also look in terms of a future node to play out, which
would be better for us to go to market. It's just the way we operate in terms of how
we bring architectures to market. So that's a very important piece, a node change or
not a node change on improving the overall processing power, but the overall
development of the software on top of this has allowed us both the ecosystem and
the broad reach that we have both with the industries and the hyperscales. At the
speed that we see AI advancing and acceleration advancing, they need that ability to
change that overall development along the way, they need the ability to program,
otherwise their investment is very, very hard for them to get a return on. The return
on investment that you see from buying the overall GPUs with that full end-to-end
platform is extremely helpful to them.
Do you have any questions from the audience? One in the back.
Just a couple of big picture questions in terms of -- it feels to me like automated
driving is not as much in the news, as it used to be. I just wanted to see if you feel
that area is losing momentum or how you feel about that. And secondly, another
area that used to be very popular at least in ordinary people kind of way which is
cyber currency, just wondered how you see trends there for you in the future?

Page 11 of 11Unidentiﬁed Participant
Colette M. KressSure, let me focus on the autonomous vehicle area, still a very important part of the
industry as they see forward. A lot of that has been branched in terms of our focus,
what do they want to concentrate on for the overall passenger cars over the next
couple of years in terms of the Level 2+, Level 3 and incorporating overall hardware
that allows them to continue to advance the software. But what you ﬁnd is the focus
in terms of Level 4, Level 5, a harder overall piece of work has been changed to two
diﬀerent areas. One, focused on key metropolises in terms of square miles, to focus
in terms of a captured area and focus. And then, number two, focused on long-haul
such as transportation, trucks, last-mile delivery, in terms of the work that there is. So,
still very, very important piece of work, probably being pushed about a couple of
years for overall passenger types of cars to get up to that speed, but still very
important to the automotive transportation industry.
Now, in terms of crypto-currency, right now, I'd say, I don't see any of it, which is
great so far, so we can concentrate on our core strategic businesses. So, right now,
we don't see anything particular in the market.
Okay, with that we've ended our time here, but I want to thank everyone for joining
us and especially, Colette, for spending some time with me this morning. Thank you
very much.
