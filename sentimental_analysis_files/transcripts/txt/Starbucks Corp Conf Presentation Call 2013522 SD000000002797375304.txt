Good morning, everyone. Thank you, all for joining us this morning. And I should say
good evening to those in the States who are about to go to bed. Thank you for
joining us for day two of our Americas Select Conference here at Barclays.
My name is Jeﬀ Bernstein. I am the restaurant analyst from Barclays, based out of
New York. I have the pleasure of kicking things oﬀ this morning, introducing our next
presenting company at the conference, Starbucks Corporation.
For those not familiar, if that's possible, they are what we believe is one of the
leading global growth stories across not just restaurants but broader retail, with an
industry-leading US retail coﬀee platform and signiﬁcant international growth
opportunities, led by China as one of the many forces outside of the US. And then a
developing consumer products segment which management believes will one day
rival the worldwide retail platform. So a pretty large opportunity from a consumer
product standpoint.
With that said, joining us today to share details on the story we have Troy Alstead,
who is the CFO and CAO; and JoAnn DeGrande, who is the Director of Investor
Relations. Troy will kick it oﬀ with some prepared remarks, background on the story;
and towards the end, if there is any extra time, we will open it up for Q&A. So
hopefully people will join us for that component.
But with that said, it is our pleasure to introduce Starbucks and Troy Alstead.

Thank you, Jeﬀ. Thanks for joining me at this early hour, everyone. I appreciate the
chance to be here with you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-22

Page 2 of 17I will spend some time with some prepared remarks. And then as Jeﬀ mentioned I
look forward to taking whatever questions you might have at that point in time. Jeﬀ
introduced JoAnn DeGrande; also she is here to help with any questions. She is our
Vice President of Investor Relations and will help.
Now by way of just brief background for those of you who I don't know, I've been
with Starbucks for more than 20 years now. I joined the Company when it was a
privately held, small coﬀee company in Seattle, Washington. The big aspiration of the
Company at that point in time was to consider opening coﬀee shops as far away as
California, which at that point in time that seemed like a long stretch in the Company.
There was a lot of skeptics about whether the concept would work in a warm
weather environment. So we have clearly come a long way in that span of time.
Over my 20 years with the Company I have been in the ﬁnance function really all
over the world. And then on a few occasions have stepped out of ﬁnance into
general management roles. Many years, ago on an interim basis I ran our EMEA
operations headquartered out of Amsterdam; had Latin America reporting to me; I
have run Japan at diﬀerent times; and I have been the Chief Operating Oﬃcer of our
business in China for a period of time. So I have had the opportunity over that span
of time, in addition to my ﬁnance roles, to really understand the business at quite
some depth; and I'm looking forward to spending some time providing an overview
of that for you, for those of you a little less familiar with the story.
We have, over the 40 years of the Company of Starbucks, over our history have built
a portfolio of brands and recently have added into that portfolio of brands. But I
would point out that our -- the activities of the Company, the brands. And even some
of the recent acquisitions we have done and the many initiatives that we have going
on in the Company are all very closely focused around the core of the coﬀee and tea
experience. The heritage of the Company is in coﬀee and tea. And all of our activities
really circle very closely around coﬀee and tea and the experiences associated with
the coﬀee house.
We are in 62 countries now globally. We have almost 19,000 stores around the
world.
And what is important and increasingly an important part of the Company's strategy
beyond the expansion of our store base, which is the original roots of the Company,
is an increasing presence in Channel Development. Channel Development is the
part of our business that really includes everything outside of the Starbucks store --
foodservice, CPG, vending in places, anything that happens outside of that core
Starbucks store experience is in our Channel Development business. We will come
back to that shortly. But it is a key, critical strategy as we continue to grow around the
world.
The roots of the Company are in the coﬀee shop, the Starbucks store. It really is that
store that has allowed us over time to introduce customers to our products, to theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 17experiences of Starbucks, to provide that daily habit and ritual. The store is a key
driver of revenue and proﬁtability and great capital returns in the Company.
The stores also play a critical role in creating a platform to introduce our products to
customers. What we have learned over time, as we have grown from being more
than just that Starbucks store around the world to really being a global consumer
brand in a category -- coﬀee and tea -- that people interact with in so many places in
their lives -- in a coﬀee shop, in your home in the morning, at a hotel, in the oﬃce, on
your way to work, at a restaurant. The core products oﬀerings that we have are such
an integral part of people's lives that the store gives us the chance to introduce what
Starbucks is about to the customer and then leverage that outside of the store into
other channels. Down the grocery aisle, in restaurants, on airplanes, anywhere and
everywhere someone may want to look for a cup of coﬀee we have a chance,
increasingly over time, to be a part of that experience.
The store also provides the opportunity to provide that engagement. Increasingly we
are leveraging and deepening that customer interaction with the barista into the
digital channels. We will come back to that shortly; but our loyalty, our digital
presence, social media, all have allowed us to really fuel and expand our relationship
with the customer very powerfully and very eﬀectively for us.
The history of the Company is deeply rooted in ethical sourcing of our coﬀee, in our
community involvement. By deﬁnition a coﬀee shop -- anybody's. But certainly
Starbucks -- is a part of communities. It is a part of neighborhoods.
What has happened organically over our long 40-year history is that our stores have
often become that launching pad for our store partners -- that is what we call our
employees, our partners in our Company -- to be deeply engaged in our
communities. As a Company we have a target of having 1 million hours, 1 million
service hours into our local communities by 2015. And we are well on a path to that
level of community involvement and volunteer activity in our communities that
ranges from all kinds of areas of cleaning up parks to working with food banks,
working with shelters around the world in whatever communities we operate.
Our coﬀee. And the quality of our coﬀee. And our engagement with the farming
communities has also always been critically important to us. We have had long-
standing relationships with organizations such as Conservation International, such as
Fair Trade and many others, all around ensuring high-quality coﬀee. And the
sustainability of coﬀee. And the health and sustainability and responsibility that we
hold to our farming communities around the world. It is a part of our responsibility
we take very seriously and are extremely active in around the world.
And environmental sustainability has always been a core pillar and platform of the
Company. As an example, all new Starbucks stores that are built are LEED certiﬁed,
one of many areas where we believe we can have a critical impact as we continue to
grow from here.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 17Now, in addition to that deep commitment to our communities and to our growing
regions around the world, we are also deeply committed to providing healthy and
growing ﬁnancial returns to our shareholders and through really a balanced
combination of driving top-line growth and delivering margin expansion and
earnings growth faster than driving the top-line.
We have had a sustainable target, as many of you know, of driving revenue growth
greater than 10%. We've delivered against that for a number of years and expect to
deliver against that 10%-plus revenue growth again this current ﬁscal year and at the
same time driving improvements in margins. We expect about 100 basis points of
operating margin expansion in the current ﬁscal year.
That combination of the strong growth in the top-line and margin expansion has
allowed us to consistently deliver earnings growth in the 15% to 20% range, which
has been our long-term target and where we have sustainably and consistently for a
number of years delivered. Our earnings per share target for the current ﬁscal year --
and our ﬁscal year ends at the end of September -- is in a range of $2.12 to $2.18.
Compared to last year's $1.79, that is growth of 18% 22% EPS growth. So very much at
the top end of our target range is where we expect to deliver earnings growth in this
current ﬁscal year.
Now let me walk you through each of our four operating units around the world
brieﬂy and give you some highlights from each of them. Starting with the Americas,
clearly our largest business unit we have, the core of which is our US business. This
region is the engine of growth and proﬁtability in the Company.
It is still dominates our overall revenue mix in the Company. It is an almost $10 billion
business a year ago; and in this current ﬁscal year the Americas will be well over a
$10 billion business for us. High proﬁt.
And as large as the Americas is and as large as the US business is for us, we continue
to drive revenue growth through both new store additions, proﬁtable, steady,
sustainable growth of new stores across the US in this whole region. And increasing
focus on driving same-store sales. We will come back to volumes per store here
shortly. But average unit volumes in the US today are at an all-time high of $1.2
million per store per year.
And that is growing while we are also elevating margin through revenue growth. But
also through heavy focus on the eﬃciency of our operations, through applying Lean
principles within our stores. Labor deployment, waste management, all the many
activities that as we continue to grow we continue to seek out a multitude of
initiatives that allow us to deliver a very mature business into increasing levels of
proﬁtability.
Beyond just the core US business, which is a big, dominant part of this Americas
region, we have been in Canada for a long time. We have about 1,000 stores in
Canada and are increasingly recognizing that we have a much bigger opportunity inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 17Canada than we perhaps have exploited even over the last ﬁve to 10 years. So with
new management in Canada over the past year, we really re-architecting and
developing our growth plans for that part of the Americas region and believe we
have a tremendous opportunity for additional store growth, revenue growth. And
increased proﬁtability out of Canada.
Then, Latin America for us is newer. But high growth, high margin. It is a part of the
world we are very excited about.
Today, the biggest part of Latin America for us is Mexico, which we operate through
a fully licensed partnership, very proﬁtable and a good healthy marketplace for us.
Then newer, an opportunity such as Brazil, where we have perhaps only 50 stores
today but see the opportunity over time to grow with great economics a very large
business in Brazil and through the rest of Latin America.
Europe, Middle East. And Africa has been a much tougher part of the world for us.
The biggest part of that world is here in the UK. Much of our challenges in this part
of the world, frankly, are of our own doing. That dates back many, many years ago,
where we had a ﬂawed strategy and chased some real estate and made some
decisions that we should not have made here.
The focus of the past two years with the team here in the UK and in our European
headquarters has been to really restructure and reposition our business in Europe.
That restructuring has included closing stores that were unproﬁtable, that frankly we
should not have opened in the ﬁrst place many years ago. It has included relicensing
parts of the region.
For example, Ireland used to be a Company-operated market for Starbucks. We were
never able to make money in Ireland. It is not large enough for us to be able to
deploy our capital and our infrastructure into driving that marketplace forward.
A year ago we sold that to a licensee. And now it is proﬁtable for them and it is
proﬁtable for us. It is a reﬂection of our strategy of being much more thoughtful
about where we deploy Company-owned capital to get the returns we need and be
eﬀective and be able to leverage our infrastructure in the right and appropriate
ways.
Even within the UK we have done some licensing of some stores in some venues
where it is more sensible to let somebody else who is far more capable to operate in
that location, operate in that location. Not unlike the strategy we have applied
historically to the US, for example. But have not approached it quite right here over
the years.
So we are in the process of working our way through that. We have done a great
deal of cost restructuring both in the G&A organization here in the UK and in Europe,
in our supply chain. We historically had a very unwieldy, high-cost, ineﬀective
distribution system in the UK. We spent about a year and a half, almost two yearsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 17turning that upside down and re-initiating that in a consolidated distribution model,
which is already much more eﬀective. And by itself we expect to add about 200
basis points to gross margin over the next two years.
Then beyond the cost work, signiﬁcant consumer-facing initiatives, really learning
from the success we've had in the US, dating back to 2008 and 2009, when we really
drove a signiﬁcant improvement in our US business. We focused on things like
customer satisfaction in stores, cleanliness of stores, how the customers measure our
service levels.
We have remodeled stores, freshened up stores; we have more of those to do. We
have begun to introduce our loyalty program into the UK and into some markets on
the Continent. All of these initiatives are newer here than in the US. But we are
optimistic that each of them over time will be able to help us move this region in the
right direction.
With all that said, we are beginning to see the early signs of improvement here. We
have a long ways to go. We think it will be several years of progression forward.
But I would anticipate every year, including 2013 and then each year forward, for us
to improve margin slowly into the double digits here in Europe, with an ultimate
target somewhere in the mid to upper teens. Now, we have conﬁdence in that path
even though it will take some time, because we have pockets of our business here in
the UK and pockets -- countries around Europe that are equally high cost structure
that are already operating at that kind of margin level.
We know we have a model that can work eﬀectively. We just have to reposition the
business to get to that place.
I would contrast that with China/Asia Paciﬁc, which is our fastest-growing geographic
region anywhere in the world and also the highest-margin geographic region we
have anywhere in the world, with margins sustainably above 30% and, with the
growth we are driving all across the region but really dominated by China, driving
revenue growth of greater than 20% fairly consistently.
Our oldest market and our largest market today in this region is Japan, which is a
highly proﬁtable, fairly stable, moderately growing. And sustainably steadily growing
business for us both in terms of store count but also the other channels outside of
the Starbucks store.
Rapidly growing in China, which before long will become our second-largest market
anywhere in the world. Very powerful unit economics. And we have got a long
runway we believe for very proﬁtable, high capital-returning growth to navigate in
China. All the way to some of our newer markets such as India, which we just opened
a few months back. And Vietnam, which we just opened a month or two ago.
Tremendous growth opportunities and a very healthy economic model across this
region that we are very excited about.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 17Now, the core of all of those geographies, before I move outside of the Starbucks
store, are the economics of the store. We will open about 1,300 new stores globally
this year, split relatively evenly between the Americas and China/Asia Paciﬁc, with
very few stores in Europe. Our European growth will be predominantly licensed as
we go forward.
Globally about half of our stores, roughly, are Company-operated and the other half
are licensed. I would anticipate over time that split of ownership, while it will vary
moderately based on region and geography and venue to remain reasonably in that
50-50 split as we go forward.
Now for most of our history, the Starbucks store was really what deﬁned our
Company. It was the early parts of the business, long before we really realized there
was much of an opportunity.
And for most of our history our aspiration really was around that Starbucks store. It
was about being a premium operator of coﬀee shops all around the world.
In our history usually when we spoke about what the opportunity was at some point
in time, it was always centered around how many stores we might have. What has
happened to us over time is that the customer has pulled us out of the door into
other parts of their life. And that has opened up for us opportunities to drive
consumption at home, to look for opportunities where people consume coﬀee
anywhere. And that has led to our opportunity to take our various products and
categories, leverage them into other form factors. And pursue increasing market
share outside of the Starbucks store.
All of that activity is what falls into our Channel Development business. Channel
Development is a relatively newer strategy for us. We have been in some of the CPG
channels for a number of years. But really only in the last three to four years have we
begun to concentrate on developing a deep capability in this space and a real
strategic direction to at some point in time drive Channel Development, our
business, outside of the store closer to the size ultimately we think of what our store
business can represent for us over the very long term.
It is a high-margin business for us, margins in the mid 20%s now. Will add about 100
to 150 basis points of margin improvement this year, largely aided by commodity
costs which have been easing and progress this margin structurally, we believe,
closer to the upper 20%s and at some point in time, in the not too distant future, up
closer to 30%.
It is the business that is predominantly driving things like at-home consumption with
singleserve, our large and more mature package coﬀee business. And also large and
mature food service business. Most of these numbers today are concentrated in the
Americas and largely concentrated in the US.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 17Over time. And it is beginning now, the real opportunity is to begin to mature these
channels aggressively into other regions around the world. Our strategy generally is
to build out the brand and the consumer awareness, the whole proposition of
Starbucks, using the Starbucks store ﬁrst; and then once we reach some tipping
point in that brand awareness and that understanding of what Starbucks is all about,
then we began to stretch and leverage that into the channels outside of the
Starbucks store.
For example, we have been in China for 13 or 14 years now, since the late '90s. We
are just getting closer to the point where we believe that marketplace is ready for us
to really begin to pursue product launches and opportunities outside of the
Starbucks store, using things such as our ready-to-drink beverages, as an example.
Now historically, most of our growth has been organic; and I would fully anticipate
that we will always be a predominantly organically growing Company. But we have
recently added in some tuck-ins, relatively small acquisitions, which are really about
leveraging some opportunities much more meaningfully than we felt we could really
achieve organically.
One example of that is La Boulange. It is a small acquisition that we did in San
Francisco which deepens our capabilities around food. Food is approximately 19% of
the sales mix of a Starbucks store globally -- it is also about 19% in the US -- with a
range of low teens in some markets to upper 20%s, even north of 30% share of that
store sales in some markets around the world.
With that said, food has always been the category where we have disappointed our
customers the most and where we've had the most opportunity to drive more
volumes, both as an attachment to an existing transaction and also ultimately, as we
convince the customers that we have a more appealing food program, we believe
food can be a more meaningful traﬃc driver for us.
Particularly in the US around those afternoon dayparts, we know that food is a more
meaningful decision factor for a customer in the afternoon, which is a slower time of
our business in the US, than it is in the morning. A tremendous opportunity for us to
innovate and elevate that food program. La Boulange, in the very early days of our
testing, is elevating that both in terms of how customers rate our food program but
also how much they are buying and that's -- we are seeing some very early signs
here.
All the way to tea on the other side, which we believe can be a meaningful
contributor to incremental growth in the years ahead. The original name of Starbucks
was Starbucks Coﬀee, Tea and Spices; tea has been in the core of our business for
more than 40 years.
It is the second most-consumed beverage in the world, only second to water. And
yet in Starbucks it is tiny, low single-digit share of our overall sales. It has never beenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 17a focus of ours and nor have we ever put the kind of energy against it or had the
capabilities in tea that we have historically provided within coﬀee.
We are excited about the acquisition of Teavana, which allows us both to roll out a
contemporary teahouse, ﬁrst in the US then more meaningfully around the world
ultimately. But then also then to bring those capabilities around tea back into the
Starbucks store, to really use tea as a complementary beverage to that experience
within Starbucks, with innovation around beverages, daypart kinds of innovations,
food pairings, in ways that we have never approached historically.
That is all beginning now. And over the next one and two and three years we would
anticipate tea being an incremental driver of revenue and proﬁtability in the
Company.
The umbrella over all of that for us has been a very powerful movement into all
things digital. That ranges everywhere from some paid digital advertising to the
mobile app, which is the fastest-growing mobile app for payments in the US, all the
way to the Starbucks Card, which has been around for more than 10 years in our
business as a transaction tool but more recently has become the tool by which our
loyalty program sits on top of.
About a third of our transactions of a $13 billion revenue company are prepaid by
virtue of the Starbucks Card in either the physical card format or the mobile app.
And that is increasingly giving us not only a connection and engagement to the
customer but also a sustainability, a stickiness to that transaction that we believe has
allowed us to have more stability in what has been, particularly in the US, a bit of a
choppy environment. Evidenced I think -- some others in the space out there, ours
has been a much more stable kind of revenue and comp growth, driven by many
things but we also believe heavily contributed by our loyalty program and the fact
that people have the money loaded on their card. They're much less likely to pass by
a Starbucks store if they are pre-loaded with the money on the card.
Social media, unpaid for us, has been a very authentic way for us to reach our
customers. Starbucks has never been a big advertising company. But social media
and people's ability to really engage with their friends around their experiences at
Starbucks allows us to reach them in a very authentic, more genuine way that
resonates with our demographic very powerfully.
Now we have the fortune of having a business that is very high cash ﬂow on a routine
basis. That has allowed us with cash from operations to fund all the appropriate
investments back into the business -- new stores, renovations, investments in
manufacturing. And systems and technology over time. And it has also allowed us
increasingly to then return cash to shareholders.
We initiated a dividend about three years ago. We are committed to growing the
dividend, both as earnings grow and also the payout ratio. We pay out today at
about between a 35% to 40% target ratio. I would fully anticipate over time elevatingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-22

A - Troy Alsteadthat; we believe we have a cash ﬂow that enables us to pay out a higher ratio than
that.
We have been a moderate repurchaser of shares. I would expect us to continue to
be a moderate repurchaser of shares as time progresses.
Our targets, as I hit a few of them earlier, for ﬁscal '13 are very consistent with our
long-term targets. In all the investments we have made and that I have described in
our business into those next layers of growth drivers in food, in tea, the loyalty
program, what we can do with mobile payments -- all of that together, we believe,
gives us the ability to be conﬁdent in driving 10% or greater revenue growth
sustainably for about as far forward in our planning as we can see, driven by comp
store sales in that mid single digit range both in the US, our biggest market. And also
globally. Then through the margin expansion driving earnings growth consistently in
that 15% to 20% range, again, with this current year being closer to the top end of
that range is what we expect.
Then we are heavily focused on return on capital as a Company. We have
progressed return on capital into the low 20%s and on a pace of improving ROIC
every year to reach above 25% here within the next couple years. And we will
sustainably -- believe we have an opportunity to sustain that and grow that further.
With that, I will pause in my prepared remarks and, Jeﬀ, would love to just open up
to whatever questions we might have.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 7208345 <GO>}
Great. Thank you, Troy. I would love to open up to any questions in the room,
otherwise I have a few of my own. But I would rather hear yours.
(inaudible; microphone inaccessible)
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Food, as I mentioned earlier, today is about 19% of the sales mix of the Company,
almost 20%. So it is a greater than $2 billion category for us today.
With that we have a range, as I mentioned, around the world. Even if I just look at
Starbucks stores, if I use that as the benchmark, from low teens in some places to
markets that are performing better on their food execution of 25% to 30% or higher.
So we believe we have an opportunity over time to progress that 19% at least 10
points higher into the upper 20%s somewhere. And that is not an explicit target as
much as we believe that is the opportunity of what we can do with food.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 11 of 17Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Troy AlsteadWe come at that both from what we have seen in selected markets around the world
and also what we hear from our customers. Today in the US, for example -- and this is
reasonably true globally. But if I just focus on the US for a moment -- two-thirds of
our transactions don't have any food item on them. So one third of the people who
buy a beverage also attach some food item to it; two-thirds of the transactions in our
stores have no food on them.
And of those two-thirds, when we spend a lot of time understanding that customer,
those people -- we have already acquired them, they are walking in the door, their
wallet is open, they want to give us money, they want to be in Starbucks. And yet --
and many of them want food. But they historically have not bought our food for one
of two reasons. It either hasn't me their quality expectations -- we are working heavy
to address that -- or it hasn't been appropriate to the daypart, to wherever they're at.
Our food program historically was mostly morning, bakery kinds of items. We have in
the last few years heavily innovated against the midday daypart, in the US, for
example. Heavily innovated against food that is more appropriate for that snack
occasion in the afternoon.
What we are ﬁnding is, as we give people things that are of higher quality and
matches the occasion, ﬁts the time of day, matches the beverage pairing that they
have, that they buy more food. Perhaps not a surprise.
So that leads us also to believe that we have got a tremendous opportunity to grow
food faster in the years ahead than we do our core business. So I believe that our
business can grow, again, from about 19% of sales mix to the upper 20%s over time,
given the kind of pathway we can see. And that is while we are still growing the
overall business. So that will be a fairly rapid growth in the overall size of food during
that period of time.
Could you please just give us an update on the economics of the newly opened
stores in China and the strength of the Chinese consumer you are seeing right now?
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Yes. Our stores in China are approximately annual unit volumes of about $800,000; I
benchmark it into dollars. Now by the way, that is about twice the volumes that they
were just a handful of years ago. Our volumes in China have been growing quite
rapidly both as we have opened up new stores at higher volumes, as the awareness
of the brand has grown. And also by very powerful, strong comp growth in those
stores over the last few years.
So AUVs today of about $800,000 in China. Store proﬁtability, four-wall proﬁtability
in the mid to upper 20s. So a few points higher than our benchmark gold standard
US business in terms of store economics.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-22

Page 12 of 17Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Troy AlsteadSales-to-investment ratio, that is a key ratio that we measure quite frequently. The
ﬁrst-year sales of a new store compared to the cost to build it, the capital cost of that
store, that is 2-to-1 or a little bit greater than that in the US. It is about close to 3-to-1
in most of our new stores in China. So very good, healthy unit economics as we
continue to grow in that marketplace.
I would also point out that as we have historically, as many others did, opened up in
the Tier 1 cities in China, in the last handful of years we have begun to expand more
meaningfully in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 and are seeing very comparable economics in
those cities as we do in the Tier 1 cities.
We have about 850 stores I think today on Mainland China. We have targeted 1,500
stores by 2015. We're well on our pace to get to that benchmark.
And that is just a waypoint. We actually are quite conﬁdent we have thousands of
stores of opportunity in China. So very good healthy economics.
Now, the Chinese consumer. I think there is no question that the rapid pace of that
Chinese consumer has slowed a bit. Everyone else has seen it.
To be honest with you, I think Starbucks was a bit insulated from that for the last
couple years. We know our friends at Yum! and others were experiencing that a little
bit more quickly than we were. I would suggest by virtue of us being a bit smaller in
that marketplace and a premium or aspirational brand that was just growing in
China, that we were perhaps a little insulated from that impact.
But in the last quarter or two, we think around the edges we are seeing just a little bit
of a slowing in the trajectory of growth. We still have very strong same-store sales
growth in China. Our new stores are still opening up with the great economics. But
you can see the consumer has just slowed up a little bit. And I think that is -- we're
watching it very closely. But that is what it looks like to us.
Can you talk a bit about changing consumer coﬀee consumption patterns and how
that is aﬀecting you? Obviously, Nespresso has been very successful in Europe. I
mean I will be honest, I was and still am a Starbucks customer. We have got an
espresso machine in the oﬃce; I use that more than going out. How do you see that
sort of consumption pattern unfold in the years ahead?
And following up on China, China is obviously not a coﬀee-drinking nation.
Consumption per capita is signiﬁcantly lower. If I look at players like Nestle with very
strong coﬀee franchises, they have actually tried to localize content quite
signiﬁcantly in China. So how do you see that unfolding as well?

Page 13 of 17Yes, let me speak to the last part ﬁrst if I can. China, when we ﬁrst entered China 15
years ago, had -- the contemporary coﬀeehouse that Starbucks represents and Costa
here and others really didn't exist in any kind of meaningful way, shape, or form,
other than a few probably independent little startups and copycats here and there.
As we have grown rapidly, as others have grown rapidly in China, there is a dramatic
change in -- (quickly) that younger generation adopting coﬀee as a beverage and
adopting the whole coﬀeehouse lifestyle quite dramatically.
So coﬀee consumption per capita is tiny; but in the bigger cities and particularly
among the younger generation, that aspirational generation in China, it is actually
growing rapidly. Again we are certainly a part of that and many others are in China
today.
Interestingly, when people ﬁrst started in China to experience the Starbucks brand
years ago, it wasn't so much coming in because of the coﬀee; it was coming in
because of the experience, or what they may have seen in their travels. And what
they may have seen in movie is that they would see Starbucks or something similar.
That is often what brings people in. And the social aspect of what a coﬀee house is
all about.
Then the coﬀee habit and the innovative beverages we can provide to them become
something that develops later on. And that is how we have seen that in our several
years now in China. That is how we have seen that progress and continuing to grow.
Now, there is two -- to the coﬀee market and consumption overall there is two very
large, very signiﬁcant changing consumer patterns happening. One has been a 20-
year change from lower-end coﬀee to super-premium coﬀee, heavily in the US but
really around the world, driven by many coﬀee players. Certainly Nestle and
Starbucks and Costa here and many others have pulled people from what used to
be in many markets around the world -- and I would just say particularly in the US --
really low-quality, poor coﬀee to something better, usually deﬁned by premium
arabica coﬀees. That has been one change. And that trend continues.
The newer change, of course, is to all things singleserve. That is more advanced in
many markets in Europe.
It has been a relatively newer change in overall consumption in the US of course,
where people have been rapidly shifting, I think in all parts of their life. It is much
more than coﬀee. It is about this move into convenience and simplicity and speed
that has led people to change their consumption from brewing 10 and 12 cups at a
time to wanting the convenience of singleserve.
Keurig in the US has done a fantastic job getting their low-pressure brewed
machines placed in people's homes. Nespresso in Europe has driven the more high-
pressure espresso-based singleserve. But all that dynamic is, we believe, a freight
train that will continue to roll.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-22

A - Troy AlsteadThe US moved from probably 0% consumption in singleserve ﬁve or six or eight
years ago to 25% and rapidly growing now of consumption in singleserve. And we
anticipate there is no reason that the US marketplace over a handful of years ahead
of us can't progress to singleserve consumption like Germany, or like some many
other markets in Europe that is more advanced.
We would fully anticipate that trend to continue. That has more strategic implications
on Starbucks than others, where we are navigating and balancing a very big, mature,
highly proﬁtable packaged coﬀee business with continued leadership in the
singleserve, where we can be a part of other people's equipment platforms.
I will point out one element of our strategy which is Starbucks has no intent to be an
equipment company. We strongly believe our equities, our capabilities, what we can
really do is around coﬀee. The brand of our coﬀee, the innovation of the coﬀee, the
variety of coﬀee, choices you can provide to people. And tea. And other forms of
singleserve.
Our interest is to partner with others who have the equipment platforms, which leads
us to our Verismo partnership with Krueger; which leads us to our Keurig
partnership, with Green Mountain. And over time we will explore more of these as
those opportunities develop around the world.

On the store?
Yes.
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
We have never seen any impact between at-home consumption and store
consumption. Both in terms of all the transactional data and what consumers say.
They tend to be -- other than probably some movement around the edges, it tends
to be very distinct consumption habits for people.
So people don't trade -- particularly the American consumer, they don't trade their
at-home consumption even as it gets higher quality and more convenient with that
store experience. What we have found that is very encouraging is, with the advent of
singleserve, people consume more coﬀee. As it is easier to drink coﬀee, they drink
more coﬀee.
We don't know how far that continues, by the way. But that has been an interesting
trend and a very valuable one for us in the last handful of years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-22

A - Troy AlsteadAs much as we love our historical higher-margin packaged coﬀee business, revenue
per serving and margin dollars per serving are dramatically higher, of course, in
singleserve. So the economics are very powerful. And we are very excited about that
move as time goes on.
Hi. Can you maybe expand a little bit on the tea platform that you are building with
the Teavana acquisition and how you are integrating that?
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Yes, I will. The acquisition of Teavana is really a threefold proposition for us, two high
priority and one a little further down the road; and I will explain each of them. The
ﬁrst opportunity with Teavana is for us to continue to roll out the standalone Teavana
store concept, not exactly as it exists today.
The Teavana store, for those of you familiar with it in the US, is predominantly a mall-
based mercantile. Very little beverage presence at all. Largely dry tea, great selection
of wonderful teas. And merchandise.
That is a very eﬀective, great unit economics model. We'll continue to add Teavana
stores in the appropriate locations that are consistent with the previous generation.
But what we are heavily working on together with the Teavana team that we have
acquired is to bring to bear what Starbucks does so well, which is beverage
innovation; it is theater in the store; is the beverage bar concept. And creating a new
concept of a tea house, a Teavana based teahouse, that will feel very similar and very
familiar to that Teavana customer but will, we believe, add another layer of revenue
and proﬁtability and growth into the Teavana concept, which is by bringing some
innovative kinds of tea beverages into that concept.
So ﬁrst leg of growth for us with tea is the Teavana store. Again, a new generation of
Teavana store that will begin to open up later this year. And we believe there is
hundreds of those kinds of stores, ﬁrst focusing on the US. But ultimately in other
markets around the world.
The second value to us of this Teavana acquisition is to now allow us to focus much
more on how we bring tea to bear within a Starbucks store. One of the things we
have learned from our customer, particularly in recent years as we've really tried to
dig deeper into understanding our customer, is that the core Starbucks customer
who is a coﬀee drinker is also a tea drinker.
Now I'll be honest with you. I don't think we understood that years ago. They are also
a tea drinker. But we didn't get that tea consumption from them, even if we were
getting that coﬀee consumption, because they never viewed that Starbucks had the
quality of tea they wanted or were even aware that we oﬀered tea meaningfully in
our stores.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-05-22

A - Troy AlsteadWhat Teavana allows us to do is deepen our capability around high-quality sourcing
and blending of tea. And again by bringing together are beverage innovation
capabilities in our R&D facilities we are developing a whole new platform of tea
beverages that we think will be very exciting, that will come into the Starbucks store.
It is a very complementary daypart. To the American consumer in particular, tea
tends to be -- if coﬀee to the American customer is a morning, on your way to work,
fast kind of daily routine, tea tends to be a little bit more relaxed, zen-like, afternoon
kind of experience. It is very complementary to the four walls of our store. So we are
excited about adding that next layer of growth.
So second revenue driver and proﬁt driver from the Teavana acquisition is within the
Starbucks store. The third -- and the third will be a little further oﬀ, to be clear -- that
is to then take tea and Teavana more meaningfully into the CPG channels. Tea down
the grocery aisle is a huge category, all forms of tea, ready-to-drink, dried.
And we have an opportunity with a brand like Teavana, particularly as we build it
through the Starbucks platform, to create more awareness, to elevate that brand, to
create that proposition, to perhaps bring to bear Starbucks loyalty program, to move
our customers and to make them aware that now they can experience tea down the
aisle. And we will build -- we will layer that onto our CPG capability.
That is a little bit further oﬀ. But that will also be a part of that. So that is how we see
that integration unfolding. And it is progressing nicely so far.
(inaudible; microphone inaccessible)
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Teavana in CPG is probably two to three years oﬀ. The stores of Teavana are later this
year. And bringing Teavana and increased tea presence in the Starbucks stores is this
year also. The CPG presence will be a little further oﬀ.
{BIO 7208345 <GO>}
I think that's all the time we had for the formal Q&A. We have another presentation
to follow. But we did want to thank Starbucks for joining us this morning, speciﬁcally
Troy and JoAnn. And they will be with us here all day. But thank you very much.
