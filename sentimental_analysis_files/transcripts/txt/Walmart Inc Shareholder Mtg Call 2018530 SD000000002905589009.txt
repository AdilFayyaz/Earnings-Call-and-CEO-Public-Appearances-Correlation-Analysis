Good morning. It's my honor as Chair of the Walmart Board of Directors to welcome
you and formally open our 48th Annual Shareholders' Meeting. As you know, we're
taking a new approach to the format of our meeting this year. To ensure a productive
and orderly meeting, we've established some rules of conduct. We ask that you
review and follow these procedures that were being handed out as you arrived at
the meeting. If you need any assistance locating that information, please ask one of
the ushers. The Inspectors of Election today are from Broadridge Financial Solutions.
Based on their report, we have a quorum and may proceed with the business
portion of the meeting. Therefore, the meeting is now oﬃcially called to order.
The polls are open and they will remain open until approximately 10:40 a.m. Only
shareholders who held their shares before close of business on April 6, 2018 or their
proxy holders are entitled to vote shares. If you have not voted your shares or wish to
change your vote, raise your hand and the ushers will pass you a ballot.
As I've discussed before, we've made a number of changes at the board level that
reﬂect the approach we're taking throughout our company. We've deepened our
expertise in technology. We've optimized the number of board seats. And we've
made process improvements to be nimbler in our deliberations and our decision
making. We also continue to have strong independent voices, 7 out of our 11
nominees today are independent.
I'd like to take a few moments to introduce our directors. I'll ﬁrst recognize the
directors who are up for reelection, which includes myself. I'd like to ask them to
stand as I call their names and to keep standing. The Chair of our Audit Committee,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-30

Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to have a few minutes to talk
to you about what we're doing at Walmart and where we're headed. We have an
exciting year. We're moving faster, getting stronger. And we have good momentum
across many parts of the business. This is a dynamic time to be in retail. And
opportunities are emerging to serve customers in new ways so we are moving with
speed to bring them to life. We're working hard to set the company up for success,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-30
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 8whether that's in our core operations, investing in Flipkart in a growth market like
India or in our desire to combine the Asda business with Sainsbury's in the U.K. We
continue to be strategic and thoughtful about our portfolio. At the same time, we
manage our business to deliver results today. We're making big changes. And
they're the right changes to deliver long-term growth.
Last ﬁscal year, we reached more than $500 billion in revenue for the ﬁrst time as a
company. Walmart U.S. delivered the highest comp sales growth in nine years. And
U.S. e-commerce sales grew 44%. Walmart International had 10 of 11 markets post
positive comp sales for the year. And 5 of those markets grew comp sales by more
than 5%. Sam's Club comp sales have also been positive. And traﬃc has improved
for 4 consecutive quarters. We have a strong foundation and great opportunities to
better serve our customers and members.
Let me quickly take you through our strategy. As you know, our purpose is to help
people save money and live better. And our strategy gives us priorities for how we
do that. The ﬁrst objective is to make every day easier for busy families. We're
focused on making shopping easy at Walmart -- fast, friendly and fun. We want to
save customers not only money but time. And that's why we're creating seamless
shopping with a great in-store experience, easy pick up, fast delivery and apps and
websites that are simple to use.
Technology is also a big inﬂuence on our next objective, which is changing how we
work. We're becoming a more digital company. And our goal is to make the most of
technology to move faster, to be more eﬃcient and eﬀective. Changing how we
work also means strengthening our diversity and inclusion eﬀorts. In addition to
being the right thing to do, there's a strong business case for diversity and it helps us
deliver innovation within the company. Our next goal is to deliver results and
operate with discipline. We are focused on strong, eﬃcient growth as we manage
expenses and capital well.
Our last goal is to be the most trusted retailer. That means having the right people,
processes and technology in place when it comes to compliance and ethics. Earning
trust also means creating shared value for business and society. The ways we're
making a diﬀerence include things like Project Gigaton, an initiative with suppliers to
reduce emissions in the supply chain by 1 billion metric tons by 2030. It also means
being there when disasters strike, such as the devastating hurricanes last year.
We want our customers to feel good about shopping with us. We also want our
associates to feel proud to work at Walmart. And we want our shareholders to be
pleased for having invested with us. If we keep delivering on this strategy, we think
you'll be pleased with the results and proud of the company that you've invested in.
Thank you for your interest in Walmart.
And now please allow me to introduce Rachel Brand. She's the newest member of
our executive leadership team. She's the Executive Vice President of GlobalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-30

Thank you, Doug. We'll now proceed to the formal business portion of the meeting.
There are 6 matters to be brought before the meeting today. And I'll take you
through them in the order in which they appeared in the agenda. Only those 6 items,
if properly presented, will be voted on today.
As a reminder, no one is permitted to address the meeting, unless recognized by
Greg Penner, our Chairman, or by me as Walmart's Corporate Secretary.
The ﬁrst item of business is the election of 11 directors. Greg has already introduced
you to each of them. And there is more information about them in our proxy
statement.
The second item is an advisory vote to approve the compensation of Walmart's
named executive oﬃcers. Walmart's executive compensation program is designed
to reward performance and to align the interests of our executives with the interests
of our shareholders. This vote is only advisory. But the board will consider the results
as they review our executive compensation program.
The third item is the ratiﬁcation of the appointment of Ernst & Young as the
company's independent accountants for the ﬁscal year ending January 31, 2019.
Two shareholder proposals appeared in the company's 2018 proxy statement. The
company's responses also appear in the proxy statement. In a moment, I'll recognize
individuals to present each of those proposals. And I'll ask each of those individuals
to stick to your 3 minutes of allotted time and to refrain from speaking on matters
unrelated to the proposal.
The ﬁrst proposal request that Walmart adopt a policy that the chairman be
independent. Ms. (Ann Kyle), who represents the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters General Fund, will present this proposal. Ms. (Kyle)?
Hello, everyone. Mr. Chairman, my name is (Ann Kyle). And I'm presenting proposal
#4 on the proxy submitted by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters General
Fund. The proposal seeks what we believe to be a fundamental element of best
practice corporate governance, a policy wherein the chairman of the board must be
an independent director. The deﬁnition of independent is important, especially at
Walmart, where shareholders have never had independent leadership of the Board
of Directors. The fund believes the board chair should be a director who has not
previously served as an executive oﬃcer of the company and who is independent of
management. For these purposes, a director shall not be considered independent if,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-30

Arianna Smithduring the last three years, he or she has not been a part of management; not a part
of the founding family of Walmart; not someone with a business or some type of
service relationship with the company or management; and not part of a director
interlock.
An independent chair who sets agendas, priorities and procedures for the board can
enhance its oversight and accountability of management and ensure the objective
functioning of an eﬀective board. We view the alternative of a lead outside director,
even one with a robust set of duties, as adequate only in exceptional circumstances
fully disclosed by the board.
Human capital management remains a challenge. The company is the largest private
employer on earth, yet no director has disclosed expertise in human capital
management. An independent chair would be better positioned to lead the
necessary board renewal process.
Several respected institutions recommend chair independence. CalPERS' Corporate
Core Principles and Guidelines state that, "The independence of a majority of the
board is not enough; " "the leadership of the board must embrace independence.
And it must ultimately change the way in which directors interact with management."
We urge you to vote for this proposal. Thank you.
{BIO 7234302 <GO>}
Thank you, Ms. (Kyle). We appreciate your viewpoint. The second shareholder
proposal request that the company prepare a report on racial or ethnic pay gaps.
Ms. Arianna Smith, who represents the Organization United for Respect, will present
this proposal. Ms. Smith.
This proposal says: Resolved, shareholders must request Walmart prepare a report,
omitting proprietary information and prepared at reasonable cost demonstrating the
company does not have any racial or ethnic pay gaps. For purposes of this proposal,
a racial or ethnic pay gap exists when one or more particular jobs or statuses --
management, part-time work -- are disproportionately occupied by persons of a
particular racial or ethnic group compared to the composition of the workforce as a
whole or persons of one racial or ethnic group are compensated diﬀerently from
persons of another racial or ethnic group performing the same job under the same
description with the same experience and level of performance.
Good morning. My name is Arianna Smith. And I am an hourly Walmart Associate in
Barstow, California. I like working at Walmart because I really like helping my
community and making customers smile. But as a part-time employee, it is a struggle
to make ends meet. I was hired working full time to help open our store. But after a
couple of months, they moved me to part time without any warning. Now I only
bring about $200 a week home before taxes. And it's a struggle to pay my rent and
to put food on my table.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-30
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 8Rachel L. Brand
Unidentiﬁed ParticipantOver 0.5 million Walmart associates work part time. And like me, many want full-time
hours. But instead of giving associates additional hours, management at my store is
hiring more and more part-time people. In fact, a survey by the Organization United
for Respect found that 69% of all part-time associates are involuntary part time. Like
me, they would rather work full time. And for black, Latin and Asian associates at
Walmart, this number was even higher.
One way I've tried to get more hours is to get cross-trained to do money services or
customer service work. But my managers never give me the time to do these online
trainings. At my store, it seems like managers' decisions on who gets more hours or
full-time jobs are not based on merit. But rather who their friends are. Favoritism
should have no place in our stores. But too often, managers are picking and
choosing who gets ahead.
We also know that, at Walmart, managers are disproportionately white and male. This
is why I believe it's essential for Walmart to be transparent and fair. Tell us if women
and people of color are disproportionately stuck in part-time jobs. Tell us if women
are paid less than men. And please vote yes on this proposal. Tell us if black and
Latin associates are paid less than white associates.
Mr. McMillon, you said that Walmart is committed to a new era of trust and
transparency. So why wouldn't you want to make sure that Walmart is fair for all.
Thank you.

Thank you, Ms. Smith. We appreciate your viewpoints and your service as an
associate.
Lastly, as noted in the Other Matters section of our proxy statement, Ms. (Girline
Mazzorin), representing Ms. Janie Grice, will present a proposal concerning our
share repurchase program and the corresponding distribution of shares to our U.S.
associates. Ms. Mazzorin?
Resolved, shareholders call on the Board of Directors to ensure that for every dollar
that the company spend on stock buybacks, the company shall grant an equal
amount to the Associate Stock Purchase Plan for repurchase of the share to be
distributed evenly among plan participant based on the number of hours among the
company U.S. workforce. For 2018 and 2019, there is $18.8 billion authorized for stock
buybacks. So that will mean granting over $12,000 in stock for our 1.5 million
associates.
Good morning. My name is (Girline Mazzorin). I'm a current hourly associate at store
3397. I'm also a Haitian immigrant and single mom. I moved at Florida to pursue a
better life for myself and my daughter. I started at Walmart in 2016 after seeing
online ad how well Walmart treat its customer. Like many at Walmart, I'm stuck inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-30

Gregory Boyd Pennerpart-time work. Even though I'm available to work additional hours and I have asked
multiple times for a full-time position, my schedule is always random. So it's
impossible to get a second job or to pick up my daughter after school. Even after
Walmart wage increased to $11, I cannot aﬀord to pay my bills. To make ends meet, I
visit the loan centers to get cash advances. And I pay $22 each time. Walmart got
billion in tax saving this year. But they only raise our wages a tiny bit. The majority of
the beneﬁt went to the Walton family, who are the richest family in the world.
Walmart plan to give $20 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks over the
next two years. A new study found that with that money, you could boost hourly
wages well over 11 â€“ I'm sorry, $15 an hour. No oﬀense to the Walton family. But you
don't need more money. It's time to invest in associates. Sam Walton said, "The more
you share your proﬁt with your associate, the more proﬁt will accrue to the
company." Our wages are well behind a company like Costco. And they are doing
better for investor than Walmart is. And our competitor, Target, has already
committed to be $15 an hour while we are still only at $11. Our work make Walmart
proﬁtable and give an advantage over e-tailers. But we need more hours so we can
take good care of our customers and our own family. Walmart is not making any
long-term investment in associates. That's all...

Almost done, please. Listen to Mr. Sam, share your proﬁt with us. It's time for a
change. Thank you.

further matters to be presented before the meeting. And so I will now turn the chair

This proposal was also approved by a majority vote.
Proposals 4 through 6 did not receive the required votes. And therefore, each of
them failed. We will issue an announcement later today with the approximate voting
percentages for each of these proposals. And we will provide a recap of the voting

proposal will be disclosed in a ﬁling next week with the Securities and Exchange
