Questions And Answers
{BIO 15106707 <GO>}
Thanks so much and good morning to you Colette and Jeﬀ as well for -- and thank
you for allocating this time for the investment community. I'm hoping, Colette, you
can maybe start by assuring us that you and your family and the broader NVIDIA
family are safe and healthy today, and maybe along with that, say that, these are
certainly unprecedented times and I'm hoping you can maybe give us a little general
introduction and talk about the current environment and what NVIDIA is doing to
work through it today?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Will, thank you so much for the question. So, ﬁrst, let me start oﬀ, our hearts go
out to everyone aﬀected by this virus. Us too here at NVIDIA, at our corporate home
base, our oﬃces are closed. Our employees are sheltering in place and we are using
this time to take care of all of our employees, our partners, and our contractors.
NVIDIA though is in full operations, our employees are working from home
worldwide, as well as here in the Santa Clara Valley. Our partners are nearly fully
back online at this time. But even though we hold oﬀ the GTC news that we originally
had planned for these weeks, our products are on track and in contributing to this
quarter.
It is certainly interesting times indeed, but we are all working in new and creative
ways to power ahead. This week we launched GTC Digital. GTC Digital is bringing
hundreds of online sessions to researchers and developers all around the world
even though we couldn't do it in person. So far we have more than 30,000
developers, researchers, that have registered for our GTC Digital. We decided to
hold oﬀ on issuing our news or doing a keynote on our conference call at Jensen as
we wanted this time to allow people to really focus on this crisis, even though we
couldn't get our news out for this week, our products are very much on track and are
contributing to this quarter. We look forward to telling you more about them in the
coming weeks when we determine a great date that we can come forth.
But we did want to stay in communications with you and our investors, and again, we
do thank you for holding this call. The company is continuing to pay our allied
workers and even though most of them are still unable to come in during this
environment. We're also donating to local organizations that can help the most
vulnerable in our communities. And then, lastly, one of the key things that we're
proud about is that we opened up our power brick genomic sequencing software
available for free over the next 90 days to help our researchers take care of this virus.
Power brick uses GPUs, for example, to accelerate as much as 50X the analysis of
sequencing data. So that's to kind of give you a opening in terms of what we are
doing, how our operations are going.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-24

Q - Will Stein{BIO 15106707 <GO>}
Well, that really helps. Thank you, Colette. It's natural, of course, for investors to focus
on comments that you made in your last earnings call where you indicated your
expectation for a roughly $100 million impact to revenue from COVID owing to some
combination of supply and demand, and split broadly between gaming and data
center. I'm wondering if you're able to provide a directionally updated view on that,
and perhaps, maybe frame the possibilities for what we might think about July?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. When we had guided -- we had guided our quarter back in the middle of
February, we said more than a month since then. But our guide at that time was
about $100 million of revenue impact to our Q1 results. This comprehended both
supply and demand impacts, and we had roughly split that between our overall
gaming business and our overall data center business.
Well, let me ﬁrst start and discuss what we're seeing in terms of the demand impact
on our overall gaming business. China was the ﬁrst region to be impacted by this
virus, deep in the epidemic and right around the time that we had given the
guidance. But we saw headwinds in the overall iCafe and essentially the traditional
retail channel markets, as much of the foot traﬃc in China shut down in February
through the early part of March. We saw, however, better trends in the e-tail and the
e-commerce channel.
As so many students and workers remain home, there was a surge in PC game play.
So today now in China, laptop continues to grow. Our overall China desktop is
normalizing as retail demand shifts to e-tail and our iCafes are starting to reopen in
China too. We are seeing similar trends emerge in North America, as well as in
EMEA. Yes, retail has been impacted. But, however, there are no iCafes in these
regions and from an e-tail perspective, the channels are doing better. We're seeing a
lot of evidence of a surge in the gaming activity. I'll let Jeﬀ Fisher talk about this in a
little bit more time.
Moving to the supply chain impact, our inventory was available going into Chinese
New Year as this is typical for that holiday season for them to have inventory on
hand. This helped as the virus took suppliers oﬄine early in the quarter as much as
China remained on holiday while waiting to be able to return to work. We have seen
improvement in our supply chain as the virus impact had moved through. Some
suppliers are further along than others, but we think things are normalizing through
this March month that we are at. I will let Jeﬀ Fisher, again, talk a little bit more about
what we're seeing in terms of the supply on gaming.
{BIO 15106707 <GO>}
Great. Maybe, Colette, I'd like to dig a little bit more into supply conditions. It sounds
like things at NVIDIA are just ﬁne, and I think, you talked about your partners. But if
you look maybe a layer or two behind you and then in front of you through the
supply chain, is there anything you see that is out of the ordinary, certainly, I don'tFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-24

Q - Will Stein
A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Will Steinthink we'd be surprised if there were some shortages, but I'm wondering if there is
any update you can provide there?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. So when we are working through our overall deep in terms of supply channel,
as well as our overall channel market, in terms of what they're bringing to market. We
are solid in terms of the supply that they have available and may not be at perfect
stages, but being able to transport the supply, so that they can ﬁnish the overall
manufacturing of the products is probably a key part right now. So the material is
moving, the material and the overall workforce is coming back to contract
manufacturing, so that they can build these products. So we feel we are getting into
better shape than where we were sitting in February. Hopefully, as we move through
March, get to the end of March, we'll be probably close to maybe 70% to 80% in
terms of the supply necessary for the products that we'll bring to market.
{BIO 15106707 <GO>}
Then maybe we can switch to the demand side a little bit. I'm going to let, Vivek, of
course, do the gaming part of the business. But, perhaps, you can talk to us about
what you're seeing more, let's say, current and near-term in terms of data center
where -- our contact suggest that demand there remains robust, automotive, which --
and I wouldn't be surprised if there is some weakness there and maybe the market
that doesn't get as much attention as ProViz. If you can dig into each of those a little
bit, we would love to hear that?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So what we are seeing in some of our other businesses outside of our overall
gaming is, there are some areas that are deﬁnitely beneﬁting from this area. The
work from home is really driving a laptop business, which is inﬂuencing not only just
mobile laptops but also in terms of our virtual GPU business, GRID, virtual desktop
workstations, our hyperscale orders also remains strong this quarter as we've
increased the use of Internet services and also cloud computing drives up this
utilization.
Regionally, China's coming back quite well. Our US and Europe also remain quite
solid at this time. But on the ﬂip side, there are some verticals that we're going to
likely see a little bit of a negative impact. Our automotive business is probably about
5% of our overall revenue and is likely to see some negative impact. For the US, our
sectors, our -- some of our vertical sectors are also impacted areas such as oil and
gas or ﬁnancial services. But these are a very small percentage of our overall
revenue, and probably, will not have a material short-term impact in terms of what
we're seeing. Now, if we take a look at the longer term. Keep in mind that our data
center business continues to be on a strong growth trajectory, driven by a lot of new
waves in terms of our AI investments across several of our overall sectors. I'll let you
take it from here as well.
{BIO 15106707 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-24

Page 5 of 17A - Colette M. KressWell, that really does dovetail nicely with the next question I was going to ask about
trends that might beneﬁt your business and you highlighted work from home and
the relevant laptops. Are there any other parts of the business that might see some
beneﬁt. You mentioned that there is an application in the data center in the deep
learning side that might help researchers in sequencing? Maybe you can talk a little
bit about what you're seeing in terms of customer demand there?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So when we think about the urge across the world right now in terms of ﬁnding
a solution to the virus, ﬁnding a solution to the virus faster than some of the things
that have occurred in the past. Key areas in terms of health care looking for the
compute, looking for accelerated method. So we do -- we'll probably see an
increase in health care, but also in terms of the government focus as well to see what
we can do.
Those are some of the underlying areas right now that we expect to also increase
during this time. But I think it's a good time to kind of go back and remember what
we had already expected or incorporated into our current quarter, as we outlined in
terms of our guidance at the very beginning. As you recall, our data center business
has grown quite well at the end of Q4 and as we moved into Q1, we continued to see
a strong overall visibility into the quarter as well. That has been inﬂuenced by certain
vectors, in terms of, in our overall AI investments that we have done.
First, in terms of natural language understanding, conversational AI and deep
recommend daters. Given everybody online, these are continuing to be great areas
of overall demand. But in the back end, it is driving giant models for overall training.
Our growth in overall inﬂuence as AI shifts to the development portion to overall
production is also a key growth area for us as well.
We're also seeing a huge rise in the adoption of the public cloud right now and we
have more than 6,000 AI start-ups worldwide. Edge AI with areas such as the US
Postal Service and Walmart are another key example of things that are online and
people focusing on their supply and demand forecasting through this time.
Now from a competitive forces, we still need to think through some of the things that
are out there. The need for accelerated products for AI is very well accepted and
very important for us as we go forward. That's why we have been focusing on
building the accelerated AI platform for over ﬁve years and we have more $1.7
million, overall, developers.
Our performance and programmability matter as the world's data centers become
AI data centers, running this huge variety of AI networks and workloads. But the true
test of our industry standard is looking at the overall benchmarks. NVIDIA was the
only provider to submit for MLPerf for all of the ﬁve benchmark wins back in the
overall fall and this has been very important at these times, as we lead in this overall
AI space that we're in.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-24

So it sounds like the long-term trends are very solid in data center as well given the
distinguishing factor your -- in your product solution is more software-based. Maybe
we can transition to talking a little bit about the balance sheet, it's much stronger
than most semi companies that note, you have almost $11 billion of gross cash only
$2 billion of gross debt. So a lot of net cash, last 12 months EBITDA, I think, is over $4
billion, so great shape there. But if we think about the potential for a more sudden
decline in demand. It sounds like that's not really what you're seeing. But if we were
to see that materialize over the next quarter or two, can you talk to us about NVIDIA's
approach to balancing the desire to preserve all your capabilities which might
proﬁtability a bit versus the desire to preserve proﬁtability?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. So a really good question, and yes, our overall balance sheet position is quite,
quite strong. Our cash balance been in the double digits, more than $11 billion
probably at this point and looking in terms of the amount of operating cash ﬂows
that we were able to complete at the end of ﬁscal year '20 at about $4 billion.
Our debt, we have a small amount of debt. We have $1 billion of that debt due in
2021. We have another $1 billion due in 2026. But our cash is invested in very
conservative portfolio low risk and essentially liquid instruments at this time. Our
overall liquidity position is extremely solid and we really have no concerns.
So as we move forward, our focus is really in terms of conﬁrming the business,
making sure that we can operate both of our overall OpEx and we do see some
really great opportunities as we go forward that we think we will weather through the
storm. So, given the strength of the balance sheet, given what we've already
discussed in terms of great opportunities in front of us, in front of the data center, as
well as what we're seeing in gaming and graphics. I think we're well set up to
weather through this storm.
{BIO 15106707 <GO>}
Thanks, Colette. Maybe asking a little bit more explicitly on this question. In the more
industrial part of my coverage investors talk about incrementals and decrementals,
but to maybe state it more simply, can you talk about the split of ﬁxed versus
variable costs in both your cost of goods and your OpEx?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
In our overall costs, when we think about our ﬁxed and our overall variable. I would
say, the lion's share of our costs are overall variable, variable related to our products
that we're bringing to market and pain for the overall creation of those products that
are overall contract manufacturers. Almost all of it is an overall variable.
From a ﬁxed proportion, you are just talking about our teams on board right now
and what they're doing to work with all of our contract manufacturers and ourselves
to build those products. Sure, though, we do have in some cases procured long-termFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-24

Q - Will Stein
A - Colette M. Kressagreements in order to purchase overall inventory that we have to keep in mind, and
that is visible, if you look at our overall 10-K ﬁling in terms of that amount.
Now, when we think about our OpEx. Our OpEx, for the most part, is our employees,
our employees make up a very large percentage of our overall OpEx and we kind of
consider that to be a ﬁxed cost. In addition to the overall compute that our overall
engineers are also working on to build the great products that we have and make
the investments of the things that we have in the future. So we feel solid again with
both our cash-on-hand and what we think as terms of long-term demand as we go
forward.
{BIO 15106707 <GO>}
Well, thanks, Colette. Maybe we can take one step higher a little bit and think about
NVIDIA's capital allocation strategy in general and then also in particular, we'd love
to get a status update on Mellanox. I know there were some news reports this
morning of some -- maybe some movement in that transaction, but any update there
would be very helpful?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. We've identiﬁed about three uses of our overall accounts. The ﬁrst one is
investing into our business. We play in a number of large and high-growth markets
and we need to assure that we continue to invest into that. That investment position
will take us through the long-term, but will also allow us to address these long-term
opportunities that are in front of us. We expect to make those investments in the
future, both organically with the overall team that we have, but also through
opportunistic M&A as we go forward. We are committed to continue to pay our
dividend that we have right now. And then, lastly, looking at our share repurchases,
we will stay nimble and think about the overall timing of when we would think about
future overall repurchasing shares. On the Mellanox front, we feel good about the
deal closing. We do expect this deal to close in the ﬁrst part of 2020.
{BIO 15106707 <GO>}
Great. Maybe along the lines of investing in the business, sometimes these periods
of great dislocation oﬀer opportunities to accelerate investments either through
M&A or through organic investment, anything like that that NVIDIA is contemplating
in the current environment?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
As we work through right now and think about the impacts of this market, we do
want to just make sure that we secure what we need right now from both supply
standpoint and making sure that we can meet the overall demand that we think is
arriving right now. We will continue to look at the opportunities that we can make
going forward certainly and those overall growth opportunities. There may be an
opportunity opportunistically for us to make some investments just back into our
overall business or from an overall M&A piece. But right now, I think, right now we're
just focused on that overall, meeting the overall supply and demand needs that we
are in the current quarter.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-24

Thanks, Colette. I'm on my last question, it may be -- it may require a little bit of a
longer answer. But we'd love to hear about what happens when the dust settles
relative to the current situation. If this current phenomenon of social distancing last
for some number of months or comes in waves, when all those impacts are behind
us, would you expect anything with NVIDIA's business, its market position, its supply
chain or other aspects of the business to change in any, let's say, a structural way?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So if we think about our overall growth opportunities that we have, it's kind of -
- I think it's a good reminder to help people understand that our gaming and
graphics business is deﬁnitely driving. The number of gamers globally continues to
grow and eSports continues to gain popularity with these audiences in hundreds of
millions. Our Max-Q technology has been an important piece of unlocking the
overall notebook market and also in terms of the workstation market, as a new type
of both the gaming device and an opportunity for enterprise graphics by keeping it
thin and light, as well as inﬂuencing the mobility that is necessary.
Our Studio line is a new entrant that allows us to address the 40 million creatives and
freelancers that are out there that could beneﬁt from the NVIDIA GPU. Cloud
Gaming is clearly in its development but holds a great long-term opportunity for us
as we expand to reach more than 200 million gamers and address a whole
opportunity of probably 1 billion gamers that are out there.
Our data center business will also continue to grow. We outlined late last year in
terms of a $50 billion TAM that we've identiﬁed in front of us. Training will continue
to beneﬁt and we see exponential increases in the AI model complexity that will
continue to fuel the overall training market.
Overall entrants will continue to beneﬁt from increased performance requirements
and the overall shrinking latency budgets. We are set up quite well with our overall
inferencing product, given the overall software enhancements that we have and the
overall programming that we have to address these larger and larger opportunities
for inferencing.
Edge AI, we think will be a very large business and will continue to ramp as we
extend our reach to the data centers to the edge across industries. And most
importantly, AI is probably a technology force of our time and NVIDIA is uniquely
positioned to power a good portion of the AI that's out there.
{BIO 15106707 <GO>}

turn it back to Simona.

the gaming part of the call.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Thanks, Will, and thanks to Colette, Jeﬀ and Simona for this opportunity.
Good to note that the NVIDIA communities is broadly doing okay. So maybe let's get
into gaming, fun market, most of the time, maybe extra important in these trying
times. Jeﬀ, let's start with the question that, I think, it's on top of mind for investors
and Colette touched on it at a high level. But what you are seeing from your
perspective positive or negative on the demand side, because of the ongoing
COVID-19 headlines? Any diﬀerences from a geographic perspective, any sense of
channel inventory and sell-through trends or ASP trend, just give us a snapshot of
what you -- changes positive or negative that you've noticed over the last few weeks
and how they should inform us of your gaming business at least in the near-term?
{BIO 2373419 <GO>}
Yeah. Thanks, Vivek, and thanks for hosting this. It's certainly been an interesting year
to say the least in gaming, and it's still playing out as you know, but the fundamentals
are very encouraging. Our work from home is now global. I think we're all probably
sitting home right now on this call. And graphics, as we've seen is an important
enabling technology for folks who are working remotely.
First of all, gaming, I mean, as you've read and it could imagine, the hours of
gameplay are increasing. We've seen in our installed base an increase of about
probably 50% of gaming hours. This is also evident in Steam where they've broken a
new concurrent gaming records of about 20 million gamers, all playing at the same
time on the Steam platform. We saw this ﬁrst in China, coming out of Chinese New
Year and in early Feb, and now we're starting to see it in the West in the last one
week to two weeks, in terms of viewers as well, Twitch has also, you may have read
averaged -- they've doubled their average viewership year-over-year in the last
several weeks. It's interesting even pro sports which is now also on a hiatus is moving
to eSports. Formula One, NASCAR, IndyCar have drivers are organizing races for
viewers to tune in and watch. There were 70,000 viewers on a NASCAR-e -- an online
e-NASCAR race this week.
So overall we're seeing pretty good demand trends in gaming. But obviously things
are a little ﬂuid and we'll talk a little bit more about that in a bit. Students, hundreds
of millions of students are now studying from home. OEMs are seeing a lift in laptop
demands across the performance and price range, as a result of students who now
need to take the work at home either for video conferencing or for more advanced
engineering or math work.
And then there's data scientists, then pros, designers data science creators, pros who
are working at home. There is about 20 million enterprise-based Quadro
workstations, this isn't in the gaming space, but I just wanted to comment on it.
Workers who need performance laptops or they need remote into data centers for
virtual Quadro workstations. So we're also seeing some -- a trend around higher
performance workstation-based laptops being sold to these types of workers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-24

Page 10 of 17Q - Vivek Arya
A - Jeﬀrey D. FisherYou also mentioned the supply chain, I'll talk a little bit about that. Our supply chain
is getting back to work. I think, Colette, had mentioned in our discussions with our
ASC partners and this is on the desktop side, primarily about 70% to 80% are back
to work. I will say 70% to 80% of capacity is back in place. AIC's and OEMs are all
working to catch up on inventory -- channel inventory that had been drawn down as
a result of the CNY plus COVID extended shut down.
For the most part on the desktop side channel inventories are being replenished.
They're approaching healthy numbers. On the laptop side, it's the supply chain is a
little more complex, takes a little longer and it may take a little longer to come back.
As we noted, and as I'm sure you've read demand has been strong for laptops due
to this work at home scenario. So I believe inventories are likely to remain below
normal for some amount of time. I don't know did you want to keep -- you want to
ask me some questions or I can keep adding some color?
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Yeah. Maybe just to kind of nail down the speciﬁc impact, how do we connect the
dots between gameplay and your ability to ship GPUs or just the demand for actually
GPU shipments and as part of that, if you could also give us a sense for any trends
that you might have noticed from an ASP perspective that people who are maybe
gaming more at home or otherwise, are they preferring certain kind of GPUs from an
ASP or a mix perspective than you would have noticed otherwise? Like what is the
speciﬁc demand side impact on NVIDIA?
{BIO 2373419 <GO>}
Yeah. So I think let's talk about regional ﬁrst, and I think, Colette, had mentioned that
iCafes represent, I think, you guys know reasonable amount of demand in China.
Throughout COVID, iCafes have been shut down. So that demand has -- was weaker
at the beginning of the quarter. I think that's part of what we had observed at the
beginning of the quarter and now iCafes are starting to reopen. It's still early. I would
say in the 10%, 20% iCafe traﬃc is starting to return and it will take some time, but
they're starting to reopen and will over time be normalizing.
We've seen a demand shift from retail to e-tail. It's -- the market has been very
eﬃcient, I mean, I am proud of our channel, it's very resilient and ﬁnd ways to get
product to market. In China, the -- when retail shut down, e-tail really stepped up to
pick up the demand and now we're starting to see that in other regions in the west
as well.
You talked about ASP trends. It's probably too early to tell. I mean, we've seen our
demand continues to be intact up and down the stack. So, I guess, I wouldn't expect
too much of a shift in demand as a result of COVID. But we'll get -- we'll continue to
watch that. There is deﬁnitely a correlation between gaming hours and amount of
time people are playing games and how they -- how important it is for them to win
and compete, and demand in gaming products. But it's -- so it's -- we've seen
demand is deﬁnitely intact throughout this environment, but it is hard to really put an
exact number on that correlation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-24

Got it. Then maybe, Jeﬀ, going to the technology aspect of your business, can you
give us a sense for the adoption of ray tracing technology and during among your
customer base. I think, when you guys launched that speciﬁc technology, it was at
least from the outside, perhaps, seen as a little bit ahead of its time. What is the
current status of that adoption? Do you think game publishers need an extra
incentive to adopt that? And just as part of that, I think, yesterday you also launched
DLSS 2.0, maybe explain to the investors what the beneﬁts are and how it can adopt
maybe faster, maybe how it can drive maybe faster adoption of ray tracing among
game publishers and importantly gamers?
{BIO 2373419 <GO>}
Okay. Yeah. Good question. I mean, Turing is doing great. About 50% of our -- sorry,
15% of our installed base is upgraded to Turing. If you at a high level that ramp
continues to outpace our prior-gen Pascal. Remember that our Pascal stack launched
all at the same time, eﬀectively from 1.99 up Pascal was all in-market within several
months of each other.
Our Turing stack was staggered. With 2060 and below, 3.99 and below really
shipping about six months after the higher end of the stack. So when you look at the
ramp of Turing relative to Pascal, the way we try and explain it is by normalizing this
to the T0 of each product when it ramped and in that regard the Turing ramp is
outpacing Pascal and we're super excited as is the end market. Some of the core
features that Turing brought to market, I mean, Turing announced and is really
delivering a reinvention of graphics, ray tracing, AI, and a number of features we will
talk about in a minute that have come to play through Microsoft's new update to
Direct X.
But you asked about ray tracing in particular to start and ray tracing has been around
for years. It's the movie industry for computer graphics has used it to deliver
cinematic scenes. However, it's required that each frame be rendered oﬄine to get
that type of realism in a CG type frame. RTX changed that overnight by delivering
the ability to render frames in real-time, ray traced range in real-time.
You talked about adoption, games take years to develop. Many developers want to
lead in visual realism, they want to be the ﬁrst one out, they are proud about it and
their gamers expect them to have really movie cinematics in their games as they
come to market. And these early adopters are really the ﬁrst games that have
embraced ray tracing and have come to market and the games are just amazing. I'll
mention some of them in a minute.
On top of that, the installed base for hardware-accelerated ray tracing is about to
explode, I know we want to talk about consoles in a bit. But both Sony and Microsoft
have now announced and revealed that they have hardware ray tracing capabilities
in their consoles, as this footprint continues to expand, it will bring the entire
industry forward and it's going to bring excitement among developers and gamers
alike to bring these type of eﬀects that ray -- real-time ray tracing is going to enable.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-24

Page 12 of 17So we think this is a kind of a perfect moment and a really about to usher in a new
wave of ray-traced content.
Looking at the games, we've had a number of games come to market already for
that are real-time ray tracing, some of them are just unbelievably amazing. Metro
recently shipped earlier this year. Control is one of the more recent games that really
took advantage, took ray tracing to new level, Deliver Us The Moon, an indie title that
is just stunning. But looking forward, as we've talked about, we've been working with
Microsoft and Mojang to bring ray tracing to Minecraft. And if you look at what's
possible with realistic eﬀects that ray tracing brings to Minecraft, it's just mind-
boggling.
Minecraft is probably the most important game in the world, has 100 billion views on
YouTube. There's 100 million monthly gamers playing Minecraft. And as you'll see
later in the year as Minecraft comes to market what creators and moderators are able
to do with this game exploring the world through Minecraft is going to be pretty
amazing. So we think you add Cyberpunk 2077 to that and we think this year is going
to be a great year for this technology.
You asked about DLSS 2.0. So let me talk about that, one of the core features of
Turing and our RTX technology is what we call Tensor Core, which brings AI to
graphics. DLSS takes advantage of the Tensor Cores to bring AI to gaming for the
ﬁrst time. And DLSS is eﬀectively an AI image reconstruction technology, it's a real-
time -- in real-time, it can ﬁll in missing bits from every frame, allows -- which delivers
eﬀectively a doubling of performance, you could think of a RTX 2060, which is our
299 to 349 GPU performing at a game with DLSS at roughly the performance of a
2080 tie, which is our 999 GPU. So DLSS can eﬀectively double the performance of
our entire stack as games -- as more and more games integrate this capability.
DLSS 2.0, DLSS was announced with Turing architecture back in -- at Gamescom
2018 and has continued to evolve and more games have been added. But with DLSS
2.0, it's our next-generation of this technology and it brings a new level of
performance and a new level of realism. Some of the artifacts as you could imagine
that come along with AI, reconstruction are now being -- are being resolved with
DLSS 2.0. In fact, the image is being delivered by 2.0 are often seen as better than
the original game frame.
DLSS 2.0 also has the capability, we train the network, the neural network on non-
speciﬁc content. Let me describe that for a moment, with the original, when DLSS
was ﬁrst launched, we had to train the neural net, the gaming -- the imagery
construction based on every game. So a game that had DLSS had to be trained on
the frames in that game itself was very time consuming, it took a great deal of tuning
per title.
DLSS 2.0 trains on non-games-speciﬁc. We use generalized images to train the
network. The results are not only much better, but the integration into games now is
much faster. And as part of this expectation that DLSS will become more prevalent inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-24

well, the next release of Unreal Engine 4 will have integrate DLSS. So it will be
available to any game developer who is using UE 4 for a fairly simple integration and
then we'll work with the developer to make sure that it's tuned for their game.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
And--
{BIO 2373419 <GO>}
Go ahead.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Yeah. Maybe just a quick follow-up on that, one question that comes up is that, I
think, investors understand that as the game, the production quality goes up, that's
an incentive for people to upgrade their gaming cards. But what about eSports?
Because there, the perception is that maybe the quality requirements are not as
high, so as eSports takes oﬀ, what is the impact on your gaming business, does it
change, whether it is ASP's or units or any other metric? If eSports becomes the
dominant growth driver?
{BIO 2373419 <GO>}
We're excited about both growth drivers. I mean, the AAA games and the cinematic
realism deﬁnitely drives higher-end GPUs and developers really love to take
advantage of the capabilities of RTX to deliver next-generation visuals and realism.
But you mentioned, eSports, which we're also super excited about because, I don't
know if you've seen our campaign, but there is now science behind the fact that
frames wins games. The lower the latency, the higher the frame rate, the more
accuracy you're going to have as a competitive gamer.
And if you look at the number of the installed base of users of our gamers who have
-- who can't deliver 144 frames per second or higher, it's a large number. So we
believe that there is an installed base -- as eSports grows there is an installed base,
it's going to want to upgrade to get low latency high frame rate, so they can excel
and be more competitive in eSports. Both of these factors, AAA and eSports,
national in our business going forward.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. And you brought up the game consoles that looks like they are still on track
for the second half. One perception is that is there some kind of pause before these
game consoles come out as gamers, perhaps, want to see what the important
features are and maybe what games are launch alongside. But the other aspect is,
historically, I remember that they have often stimulated the demand in the PC
gaming market as well. How are you looking at the impact on your business as these
game consoles are launched? And as part of that, if you could also, perhaps, help us
understand what impact it will have on, again, the mix of your cards, because when I
look at the performance attributes of some of these game consoles, they areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-24

A - Jeﬀrey D. Fishersigniﬁcantly higher than what they have been in prior generations. So what is the
impact overall of these game console launches in the back half on your business?
{BIO 2373419 <GO>}
Yeah. I think, you had mentioned it, I mean, historically, new consoles cycles have
been very good for PC gaming. They basically rise the tide. They give a higher
benchmark for developers to target to and the next wave of games are all going to
require higher end hardware. We've not seen installs in PC gaming, PC gamers
buying ahead of consoles in the past, I wouldn't expect that this time around either. I
think, fundamentally, gamer -- PC gamers buy stick with PC because of the scalability
and the visual, what you're able to play on PCs. I don't expect that will change this
time.
What's exciting about this cycle is that these consoles are bringing new technology
to the market. Ray tracing is probably the most important one. It's something that
we've been shipping for the last two years. We've got -- we've established a bit of an
installed base around it. I think of us as being a couple of years ahead of the industry
in this respect. So the opportunity for consoles combined with RTX to really continue
to accelerate this reinvention of graphics is super exciting to us.
Let me comment about performance. I see the performance, we've read the same
things about what's coming in consoles as you guys have. I think at the end of the
day the -- with today's games, the consoles are going to land somewhere between
the middle and the higher end of our stack. But I also think that when you add the
fact that our ray tracing capabilities are a couple of years ahead of consoles and we
have this, we have AI for graphics, we've started to deliver that in content. I think
you'll see our stack having a similar diﬀerentiation from console as what you've seen
in prior cycles, and of course, we're not standing still, we're working on next-gen
hardware as well.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
So when we see headlines in the media about particular console having center
teraﬂop or slow teraﬂops, what does that imply to you, Jeﬀ, in terms of what is the
comparable graphics card that delivers that level of performance or it isn't apples to
apples doing those kind of comparisons?
{BIO 2373419 <GO>}
Yeah. I think it's comparing teraﬂops is not apples to apples. I mean you can even
look at our architectures relative to our competitor game performance to game
performance and teraﬂops to teraﬂops, and I think, it's -- you'll see -- you won't see a
direct correlation between those numbers. The real question is what was the ultimate
game play performance. And as I mentioned, as we see games moving more and
more to RT and we have more and more games using DLSS. I think you're going to
see a real disconnect between those numbers. As I mentioned, 2060 with DLSS
performs around the 2080 tie performance and that's -- that could be a real
discontinuity as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-24

Q - Vivek Arya
A - Jeﬀrey D. Fisher
Q - Vivek AryaSo I think we've got to see how it plays out, but my general assessment is that the
performance of consoles is -- of the range of consoles that are coming out and we
still don't know exactly what the diﬀerent models would be, it will be somewhere
between -- in a range between the middle of our stack and the higher end of our
stack -- of our current stack.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Maybe just let me ask that one last way, which is, if you look at your deployed base
of gamers and you look at the performance attributes or gameplay attributes of the
new consoles, what proportion of your deployed base of gamers today has access to
that level of gameplay performance?
{BIO 2373419 <GO>}
Well, if you look at ray tracing, I mentioned, RTX is about 15% of our installed base.
So, maybe I'll start with that. I'm not -- if the question is, what kind of lift or refresh
might we see from the impact of new consoles, the performance of new consoles. I
think, it -- a majority of our installed base would want to upgrade to new -- to a new
level of performance that the games that are coming out over the next few years will
require.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. Perfect. Maybe one more level of technology detail. How important is the
manufacturing node in terms of maintaining your competitive edge because your
main competitor has adopted the 7-nanometer node ahead of you. Why has it taken
NVIDIA longer to adopt that and whenever you adopted, what could be the
potential beneﬁts and just how important is the manufacturing node when it comes
to maintaining your market share dominance in this market?
{BIO 2373419 <GO>}
Yeah. It's a good question. I mean, the race to be ﬁrst into a node for very large
ships, the beneﬁts of that have really kind of waned Moore's Law has slowed down
and architecture becomes really the most important thing. We've been competing
against 7-nanometer products for almost a year now with our 12-nanometer solution.
We continue to have the best price-performance. We continue to have the best
power eﬃciency, which you might think of as illogical if you just look speciﬁcally at
the nodes, but that's where really design architecture execution becomes super
important and that's an area we excel. When we ultimately move into smaller
technology, I think, you will see the beneﬁts of our architecture to scale even more.
So we're really looking forward to that. I don't think it's a race to be the ﬁrst into a
node anymore. It's really who has the best architectures, the best features and the
best execution.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. And maybe one last one, Jeﬀ, before we turn it back to Colette for closing
comments. Maybe the impact of game streaming on your business. I think, Colette,
touched on that, but if you could perhaps give us some more color on -- is GeForce
now kind of becoming more important to the business, and as, let's say, 5G takes oﬀ,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-24

additive to the business? Just some comments on game streaming?
{BIO 2373419 <GO>}
Yeah. Thanks. GeForce NOW, I think, you're referring to is really exciting. It's an
interesting time for game streaming. I think with work from home is -- as we're
hearing about all the demands on the Internet, not just for game streaming, but for
all forms of streaming. I mean, we've seen deﬁnitely an uptake in our service.
Gamers are now playing longer -- for longer sessions, we have streamed about 10
million hours this month so far on GeForce NOW. We've added 1.5 million users
since we launched oﬃcially took the service out of beta in February. And you're right,
we see GeForce NOW as really incremental adding to our TAM. The strategy is to
reach gamers on any device, who are under power devices. The $1 billion gamers in
the world.
On GFN, if you look at our user base, about 80% of them are playing on under
power devices, on Macs, on phones, on TVs, and certainly, in a majority on just low-
end PCs. We'll be opening that up to Chromebooks in a few months. So we're also
really excited about that opportunity. Let's see, so, Vivek, did you have another
question there on game streaming?
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Yeah. Maybe just any -- do you think 5G becomes an incremental driver for more --
{BIO 2373419 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
-- game streaming, because I know in the data center you have -- you guys have
been working with telecom carriers and Ericsson and whatnot on 5G. So I was
wondering if there is a kind of synergy between your gaming and the data center
business as 5G takes oﬀ?
{BIO 2373419 <GO>}
Sure. Yeah. No. Really good question. I mean, 5G is -- gaming is a killer use case for
5G and telcos recognize that and we've been working with many of them around the
globe to bring our service to their user base. This past week we announced even
yesterday, KDDI, one of the largest telcos in Japan. We're partnering to bring GFN
into their user base. This is in addition to SoftBank in Japan and LGU Plus in Korea,
huge gaming market. And GFN.ru, our partner in Russia, which is also bringing GFN
and has been now for several months operating GFN inside of Russia. And there's
other telcos around the globe that are going to be bringing GFN in the markets and
that's really our expansion strategy. But 5G is going to ultimately bring the type of
bandwidth and interactive -- interactivity required for this class of gaming to the
billions of gamers in the world. So it is an enabling use case and it is super exciting
for us and telcos.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-24

Great. Thank you so much, Jeﬀ. I really appreciate your time. And with that, maybe let
me turn it back to Colette for closing comments.

Okay. Thank you. So, in summary, NVIDIA is in full operation. So even though we
paused our GTC news that we were planning for this week, our products are on track
and are contributing to this quarter. In terms of demand, hyperscale demand
remained strong and our exposure to challenge verticals is small.
In gaming and graphics, e-tail is currently an important route for this demand and
new opportunities for gaming, graphics and commute, computer merging as
students and the global workforce are at home. Also discussed today, China is
coming back. While our China supply chain is normalizing, we are staying alert now
for any of the global disruptions.
Our balance sheet is strong and we have ample liquidity. We remain conﬁdent that
we will close the Mellanox acquisition and we are taking care of our employees, our
partners, and our contractors. Together we will weather the storm. Thank you, Vivek,
and Will, for hosting us today. We will stay connected with the investment
community and thanks all for joining this call.
