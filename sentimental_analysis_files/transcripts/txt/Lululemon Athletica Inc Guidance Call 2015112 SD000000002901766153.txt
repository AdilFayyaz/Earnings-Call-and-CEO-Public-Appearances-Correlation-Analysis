Good afternoon, everybody. My name is Bob Drbul and I'm from Nomura Securities.
It gives me great pleasure today to be here with Lululemon. I think we were talking
about some of my opening comments; it has been a very interesting year. And what
a diﬀerence a year makes, especially for Lululemon.
What we like about Lulu essentially is in the loyalty among the consumer, the unit
story, the unit growth opportunity that is global, the story that is there. And as the
management team has transitioned, it is always a good sign when you transition a
management team from outgoing CFO to a new CFO, that we think is also very
talented.
We have got Laurent Potdevin, is the CEO. He will be speaking. John Curry, the CFO,
will also be speaking and Chris Tham is in the front row here as well. And Jody Raitts,
the director of investor relations, is also here with us today. So with that, I would like
to turn the microphone over to Laurent.

Good afternoon. I think this mic is on. Wow. It is a big crowd for the end of the day. I
mean, I don't know if it's been as grueling for you guys as it's been for us. But the
timing of these meetings back-to-back was intense.
Anyway, John and I are very pleased to be here today to give you an update on the
business. So I will do a brief presentation. John will go a little bit further into the
press release we issued this morning. Then we will go into a function show. And I am
assuming that is why you guys are all here for. And you will get a glimpse of our
Spring 2015 products for both men's and women's.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-01-12

looking statements, statements that are covered by the safe harbor provision. And
you can ﬁnd more details in our SEC ﬁlings.
Quick overview; I mean, I couldn't be happier and more proud of the performance
that the team delivered during holiday season. We continued to build on the
momentum that we saw in Q3. Clearly, hit an inﬂection point late in Q2, early in Q3.
And we continued to build on that momentum during the holiday with higher traﬃc,
sequentially improving comps. And just a great holiday season with less markdowns
than last year.
And what I would like to do is share a quick personal story that really, in my mind,
really sort of helped me to visualize the Lululemon opportunity. So on December 26,
I was in Los Angeles where my kids live with their mom and my parents had ﬂown
from Europe. My daughter was going to a volleyball tournament and needed an
outﬁt. So we decided to go to the El Segundo store, which is the closest to their
home.
And away from the madness of Boxing Day in Canada at 1030 in the morning, I was
really hoping that I would get through and shop within fairly quiet environment. And
I walked into a jam-packed store. The music was blasting. People were lining at the
cash register. People were lining at the changing room, like arms loaded with
products. And the energy was incredible.
I mean, guests were engaging with educators. Guests were engaging with each
other. And we have called our educators, educators for a reason for a long time. And
for some reason, we have continued to call our stores, stores. But that environment
was so much more than a store. I mean, it was a community hub and the energy that
you experience in that location was just incredible.
And that is how I feel and see the Lululemon opportunity. I mean, it is a market that
we created. We have got amazing product. We are leading the market with very
strong margin and we deliver guest experience that are unique and second to none.
So when I think about the global opportunity, I really take the El Segundo store and I
take that around the world, both in stores and online, across gender with men's and
women's around the globe. And in the future across a number of new categories.
A lot of people have said, well, what are your -- what a diﬀerence a year will make.
And I wasn't around last year. And I certainly took my share of pummeling early on.
So -- but when I think about this past year. And despite all the headwinds that you
guys are very well aware of, I think the team delivered tremendous performance.
Nine months ago we had set out to achieve three goals. One was to strengthen the
foundation of the business so that we could scale the business and -- around the
globe and start growing more across multiple categories. It was to reignite our
product engine and it was to accelerate our global expansion.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-01-12

Page 3 of 7We have clearly strengthened our business foundation. Our product ﬂow, our
predictability has greatly improved. Our quality at the store level is impeccable. And
our guest experience continued to be so incredibly unique.
And we are very much on track to ﬁnish that foundational work by the end of 2015
and see the full impact of our work in Q1 of 2016 when our designers, developers
and R&D will have had a chance to work through the entire go to market calendar
and see their product come to life. From a standpoint reigniting our product engine,
Tara and Jennifer have done an outstanding job in a very short period of time re-
assorting, reﬂowing the assortment, shifting the balance of product and really
chasing the product where we had opportunities with our fashion group. And what
we saw in Q4 with tremendous performance of our bottoms, it is clearly an indication
that we have turned the corner in reigniting our product engine.
And ﬁnally, when you think about accelerating our global expansion, we opened a
store in London. We just opened a store in Singapore. We are about to open our
second store in London in Chelsea next week or the following. And we have
identiﬁed a number of showroom locations.
So we are going to be staying very true to our go to market strategy, which is about
building showrooms, getting involved in the communities, gaining momentum with
ambassadors. And we are going to do that over a shorter period of time so that we
can accelerate our international growth.
So we had three pretty signiﬁcant growth goals to achieve over the past year. And
the team delivered outstanding performance. So moving forward, I mean, we're
going to continue to build on our current momentum and 2015 -- I think John
described 2015 really well on our Q3 call when he called it an overlap year. I mean,
some of the investment that we have made in terms of building the foundation are
going to sort of normalize and phase out. I mean, we still have a couple of large
projects, including merchandising, planning. And allocation. Then we are going to
ramp up some investments around product innovation in raw materials in silhouettes
and in categories, as well as investments in the area of being very guest-centric both
in store and digitally. So you can expect to see operating margin leveraging in 2016.
When you think about the key success factor of Lululemon, it has always been about
the product, brand and community. And guest experience. And what you saw in Q4
with better product ﬂow, better predictability is that you saw the ability to see these
three circles come together. And for the ﬁrst time -- and this is tremendous -- this is a
tremendous unlock in terms of the potential of the brand, I mean, the three areas are
starting to work really closely together.
So being able to predict the product coming into the store allowed us to do much
better product notiﬁcation for our guests. It has allowed us to build campaigns that
will deliver seamlessly across digital and in stores. And it has allowed us to much
better educate our educators in-store so that they could, in turn, educate our guests.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-01-12

Page 4 of 7So we have got three fantastic leaders in those three areas with Delaney leading
store experience, with Duke Stump that recently joined us to lead brand and
community. And with Tara leading the product group. And we are really at a time
now where we can switch from playing defense to playing oﬀense. And so I am really
looking forward to those three leaders come together and unlocking so much of the
potential that we have got ahead of us. And clearly, as we start playing oﬀense,
innovation is going to be fueling all three elements of that business.
So product, well, we are leading through the design of innovative products. And the
white space of -- some of you saw our white space area last year. I mean, these guys
have done a tremendous work. That, combined with the talent that we hired on the
design side, is really giving us the tools to continue to lead in a way that is
unprecedented and really sort of focus on innovation from a raw materials
standpoint, from a silhouette standpoint across men's and women's. And down the
road across multiple categories.
And we are at a time now where, with better product ﬂow and with better
predictability, we can really start working with our vendor. We can move away from
working on the tactics of supply chain to really sort of looking down the future and
working on the innovation with them. So very clearly a year of stabilizing the
business, creating momentum from a product standpoint. And now moving full
steam ahead.
Guest experience is clearly something that we have always done really well. And our
focus is going to be in a couple of areas. One, from a digital standpoint, we have got
a tremendous opportunity to create more intimate, more personalized relationships
with our guests. And so we are implementing CRM. We are doing a full global
redesign of our website.
But think about, given that we have touched every guest experience, I mean think
about -- and I use that example because she is a friend of mine. I mean, she is a
consultant. She lives in Park City. She does most of her buying online. When she
goes to the store or, at this point in time, our new store in Park City, we don't know
who she is.
And so think about an environment where she goes to the store, we know exactly
who she is. We know what kind of activities she gets involved in. And when she goes
on vacation to Hawaii, when she lands, we actually can connect her with one of our
ambassadors and gives her like a class next to a hotel. So the ability to really
leverage technology, CRM. And from a product standpoint, our RFID project is really
going to allow us to create much more intimate and continue to build on what is
already a very good and a very unique and powerful guest experience.
Then, from a store standpoint, I mean, we have got -- we are not oversaturated. We
have got a very strong footprint and we are starting to play with diﬀerent formats. So
the economics always have to work ﬁrst. But you are starting to see us play with
diﬀerent formats.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-01-12

Page 5 of 7John CurrieSo in SoHo, we opened a men's only store. We are opening a larger footprint in
Flatiron New York or in Robson Vancouver or in Miami recently. And so we are sort of
playing with diﬀerent formats and trying to leverage the men's opportunity. And
when it comes to men's, I mean, we are trying the men's only store. But we also really
like the idea of the side-by-side because she still shops for him a lot. So a real focus
on guest experience.
And ﬁnally, from a brand and community standpoint, it is really sort of deepening
our voice. I mean, taking all the work that we do so well at the grassroots level and
sort of giving it -- amplifying that voice so that it has got global resonance. And I am
really personally very passionate about the balance of doing good and doing well.
So in the near future you kind of expect a little bit more focus on increasing our
purpose in that sense. And really sort of having a mission that makes us a little bit
more inclusive. And that is going to resonate with our guests very, very strongly.
So with that said, 2014 was a year of stabilizing the business. We did -- the whole
team did a great job battling all sorts of headwinds. I mean, the ﬁrst six months were
certainly interesting and not what I had necessarily anticipated. But our work is
paying oﬀ. The second half of the year, it has been tremendous. We're going to
continue to build on the momentum that we have created. And I am really, really
excited about 2015.
So before I turn it to John, I really want to thank him for his guidance, his advice. I
mean, this past year would have been many times more diﬃcult for me if I didn't
have him by my side. And while we are sorry to see him go, we know that he is going
to have a ton of fun skiing.
So and Stuart, who most of you -- a lot of you guys know, is a fantastic hire that -- we
conducted the search together. So very, very excited for John and for Stuart. And
obviously, John is leaving us in a very strong position, with a very, very strong
ﬁnancial team with Chris, Jody. And Winston. So with that, I will let John dive a little
bit deeper into our numbers.
{BIO 1494810 <GO>}
Thank you. Both Bob and Laurent said it. But I just have to say it as well. What a
diﬀerence a year makes. This year I am here with a CEO. That is an improvement.
And I am not standing up here explaining reduced guidance. I have the pleasure of
summarizing the increased guidance that we were able to announce this morning.
We really had a tremendous holiday season. We came in with some headwinds in
terms of store openings and currency and port disruptions. But we mitigated those
to some extent. And strong product assortment, continuation of strong traﬃc trends
that we started seeing in Q3 really allowed us to deliver a better than our
expectations for Q4.
And the strength was across the board. It was both in women's and in men's. And it
was both in stores and on e-commerce. So just brieﬂy, as we announced thisFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-01-12
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 6 of 7morning, we increased our revenue guidance for the quarter to $595 million to $600
million. So the top end of that range is increased by $15 million and we, of course,
narrowed the range because we are closer to the end of the quarter.
That translates to a combined comp for the quarter of 6% to 7%, up from previous
low single-digits. And with the leverage on the higher volume, there is strong ﬂow
through to EPS and our guidance is now $0.71 to $0.73, an increase from the
previous $0.65 to $0.69. For the year, that takes us to just under $1.8 billion with a
positive (three) combined comp and normalized EPS in the range of $1.80 to $1.82.
So we feel great about a strong ﬁnish to 2014 and we feel that momentum carrying
into 2015. Now 2015 -- I don't know how many times I have said today that I am not
giving guidance on 2015 yet. But let me just talk a little bit about some of the factors
impacting the P&L and the margin proﬁle.
Let me start by talking about currency, because with lower oil prices, Canada being a
petrodollar, there has been quite a signiﬁcant exchange reduction in the Canadian
dollar versus the US dollar over the past two to three months, even since we last
gave guidance. In the past, when most of our revenue was in Canada, a drop in the
Canadian dollar was quite catastrophic. And the point is really bad is not the case
anymore.
When the Canadian dollar is lower, of course it reduces our reported revenue in US
dollars. It also compresses our gross margin, because we buy product in US dollars,
even when it is sold in Canada. But because our head oﬃce is in Vancouver in
Canada, the SG&A that is also in Canadian dollars oﬀsets the negatives in the
revenue and the gross margin line. And in fact, we have quite a nice natural hedge at
this point. If anything, a lower Canadian dollars slightly beneﬁts us. So again, four or
ﬁve years ago that was a much diﬀerent conversation. And I think it is important to
point out that shift.
Other factors, as we head into 2015, in addition to the momentum we felt in Q4 in
terms of traﬃc, the stronger product assortment that is going to help drive topline in
2015. We have lots of growth drivers ahead of us still. We are going to end the year
at 200 stores in the US, which is 2/3 of the way to our target of 300. And we have a
robust pipeline for 2015 and beyond to complete that buildout in addition to
continuing -- to increase our penetration on our e-commerce channel.
ivivva, our second concept, which will end the year with 22 stores, has really hit its
stride. It is doing $1000 a square foot. And so it is time to put our foot to the gas a
little bit. We are looking to add up to 20 stores for ivivva next year.
In terms of margins, we talked a lot about -- for the last year about all the work that
Tara and Jennifer are doing to shore up the supply chain, all the investments in
systems and people and talent and process change. And those are well underway
and on track. But as we have said before, most of the beneﬁt of that you will see in
2016.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-01-12
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 7 of 7In 2015, there will be some beneﬁt on the margin. We certainly stabilized our
merchandise margins. We will see some improvement in airfreight. But for the most
part, the beneﬁts from that, you will see next year.
As Laurent mentioned, 2015 is sort of an overlap year in terms of investment on the
supply chain. It was a heavy year in 2014, a lot of systems and other initiatives that we
were putting the ﬁnishing touches on in 2015. And we are shifting our focus to more
forward-looking -- playing oﬀense investments including our R&D, our white space
facility. And an increased focus on innovation in our product.
In addition to investments on the supply chain, again, we are looking to play oﬀense
in terms of other areas of investment, include technology, guest experience,
innovation. And the brand. So all of this is a way of saying 2015 -- we feel like we are
entering 2015 in a strong position.
The question is not are we going to show leverage in 2015. The question is really, as
we shift to playing oﬀense, what are the right investments that are enough to be
really driving a longer-term growth of the business without taking on too much
beyond what we can execute well.
So again, we are still working on the ﬁnal touches of our 2015 budget with our
board. But again, the number one in question isn't are we showing leverage. It is
really how do we are we doing the right things to support the long-term growth of
the brand, because that is really what is important in the long run.
So that is the end of the prepared remarks ahead of the function show. So if the
audience listening to this on webcast, this concludes the formal part of the
presentation. And thank you for joining us today. We will turn oﬀ the audiovisual and
the webcast.
