{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Well thank you for joining us this afternoon. My name is Mike
McConnell. I'm the Lead Semiconductor Analyst at Paciﬁc Crest. We're very pleased
this afternoon to have Chris Evenden, Investor Relations at NVIDIA, representing the
Company.
As usual, I'll kick it oﬀ with some Q&A. But we always encourage audience
participation to hopefully hit the key topics that your interested in. And with that, let's
get started.
So Chris, maybe we can talk a little bit about company gross margins. If I think about,
in my opinion, the two drivers behind the stock performance over the last year, one
has been deﬁnitely gross margin expansion. And we're now close if not already at a
record high.
Can you kind of talk about the reasons driving the margin expansion and I think,
from here, how sustainable you think it is and if there's an opportunity for even
higher gross margins from here?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes. That's a good question. We are at a record -- Q2 is a record high by a signiﬁcant
margin. And Q2 did come in higher than we anticipated for a couple of reasons.
Tesla had a storming quarter. And Tegra was a bit lighter than we expected. And so,
combined, it gives us a very high Q2.
But even broader picture, we're a lot higher than -- we've been growing gross
margins steadily for two years now I think and all the way up into the mid; to high
50s, which is a good place to be. It's mix, right? And it's also the transition of our
business from being components, chips, to being more of a platform business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-08-12

Mike McConnellSo if you look at the value we add in each of our markets, the value is a lot more than
just a chip. In fact, for GeForce, for Quadro, for Tesla. And for GRID, physically, it's the
same piece of silicon. And the only thing that's diﬀerent is the software and the
ecosystem we build around that.
So you produce some really high-performing, high-quality 3D drivers. And you've
got GeForce. You've got the gaming GPU for consumers.
You optimize for professional applications. And you do shedloads of capability
testing and stability testing. And you've got Quadro, which is dominant market share
in the workstation space.
You build a CUDA ecosystem, a parallel programming ecosystem. You arrange for
universities to train tens of thousands of people to program parallel code on your
hardware. And you've got Tesla.
And so, these really are platforms now. We actually have more software engineers
than hardware engineers. And I think that's key to the value. That's why the margins
have been going up so much. And that's why we've been able to grow the high-
margin businesses, particularly Quadro and Tesla. And GRID I refer to as an option
on growth because it looks like it's going to be a great business. It's just I don't have
any proof points yet because we're at the trial stage still.
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
The trials are moving up nicely.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Trials are moving up extremely nicely Q on Q every quarter for the last year or so.
Then one of the things I talked about on the earnings call this year, we build this
GRID test drive, which allows you to just log into our Website and just try out GRID
because one of the challenges people have, IT departments have in evaluating
virtual desktop infrastructure is, to evaluate it, you pretty much have to build one.
And that's actually a lot of work and is very expensive.
And so, if we can just show you that actually we can give you a very good user
experience, we can support applications that you didn't think were supported by
virtual desktop infrastructure. And you can just go and see that for yourself with your
own eyes, then that should really encourage you to take it to the next stage and
actually start thinking about pilot projects because that's a big ﬁrst hump to get
people over.
And so, we had -- in the ﬁrst eight weeks of operation, there were over 10,000
people that tried it out. So there seems to be some really interesting demand there.

Mike McConnell
Chris Evenden
Mike McConnellYes. That's great. And looking at I think the other thing, in my opinion, which has
been the shareholder returns, that program has been very well received from your
investor base. We're about a little over halfway through this last -- the second tranche
of this $1 billion. And I think, if you look at your domestic cash position, it's a little bit
less than 50% of your net cash.
So can you kind of talk about the comfort level maybe going forward after we get
through this second tranche about what the Company's thinking about continuing
investor returns or shareholder returns? And can you keep up this pace I guess do
you think?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So I don't want to commit to anything for next year. So last year, we gave back $1
billion, just over $1 billion actually. This year, we said we intend to give back $1 billion.
We -- so, if you do the math, dividends come to about $190 million. We've already
done a $500 million -- executed a $500 million ASR that ﬁnished in June. So that
leaves you $310 million presumably to repurchase presumably. So that's the rest of
this year.
We do generate most of our cash oﬀshore. Before -- we haven't actually given a split
recently. But you can probably do the math. Let me see what we have said publicly.
We've said publicly that it was 80/20 oﬀshore/onshore before the convert. And that
gave us $1.5 billion of US cash when we issued that. So -- actually a net of -- a bit less
than $1.5 billion. So that's where we are.
So going forward, we have lots of options. We're still a very strong generator of cash.
Clearly, we'd rather not pay 35% just to bring it back to this country. And so, there's
always the hope that that will change. But then just being in such a strong cash
position means we do have plenty of options going forward.
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
Okay. So fair to say management's still very committed to the shareholder returns.
I'm not saying --.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
-- Yes, I don't want to make any promises for next year. But certainly, I would speak to
the last -- $2 billion in two years is quite a lot of return, right?
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
Yes. It's been very well received. Okay. Great. So if we look at I guess the near term,
there are a lot of things kind of around the Company that -- whether it was some
commentary from your competition, your foundry, some other things from the
supply chain. You guys had a great quarter, knocked it out of the park with guidance.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-08-12

Chris EvendenI guess, where did -- and including myself, where did we get things wrong? And
what were we missing that's maybe putting NVIDIA separate from some of the other
things that we were pointing to or concerned about going into kind of the the near-
term environment?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
That's an interesting question because, quite honestly -- and I've been -- every time
someone on your side of the fence raises doubts about the channel, I go back to my
team and the business managers there and say: Tell me again about the channel.
And I probe them quite closely because I want to make sure that I fully understand
all the issues there. And we are, honestly, not seeing any issues in the channel at all.
So Q2 unfolded very much as we expected it to from a GeForce perspective. The --
so, we divide our GeForce business into gaming, which is the sort of high-value
fewer-units side of the business. And OEM, which is the high-volume, low-value, low-
gross-margin business that sells through HP, Dell. And Lenovo pretty much entirely.
And those businesses had the trajectories that we expected them to have. So the
gaming business was oﬀ quite sharply in Q2 because you have a very strong Q4 on
Western holidays basically. And you have a very strong Q1 on Eastern holidays,
Chinese New Year. Then it fell oﬀ very strongly in Q2, as it always does.
And OEM, conversely, actually has a strong Q2 because there is a build for back to
school in July, right? There's nothing at all happens in May and June. Then July is the
back to school. And because of that nonlinearity of that quarter, that's why you see
an AR spike as well that you have point -- you raised in one of your reports. That's
why you see an AR spike in Q2 as well. You saw an AR spike last Q2 because it's our
least linear quarter by a signiﬁcant margin.
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
You do, what, 60% of your sales --?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
-- That's not typical. But it's been as much as that. It's been very, very high in the past.
So that's the dynamics.
Now -- so, maybe you were seeing the fall oﬀ in gaming in Q2. But that was a fall oﬀ
that we'd already factored in, right? That was understood.
The talk about inventory, we're not having any inventory problems in the channel.
Now, our competitor may be having inventory problems. That's better question for
them. Could that inventory aﬀect us should it exist? So intuitively, you'd expect, right,
at some point, they just reduce the price until it all shifts.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-08-12

Chris EvendenNow, the trouble with that is that you screw up your channel. And you mess up future
sales because it's very diﬃcult to go back to the channel then and sell something at
full price because they're going to try and wait two weeks just to see what happens,
right?
So you've got to be careful about -- you can't reduce prices willy-nilly. If they have
excess inventory, they've had that since April, right, because the cryptocurrency
mining, that fell oﬀ a cliﬀ mid-March, right? And so -- for two reasons, right? One, the
cost of the coins went down. And two, ASICs came in the market that could mine
them. So it literally switched oﬀ. So that's been around for a while, right? And it
certainly didn't aﬀect our Q2.
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
Well you don't participate in that market anyway, right?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
No. But, I'm saying that AMD's excess inventory didn't have any apparent eﬀect on
us. So it doesn't seem to be aﬀecting us that way.
Now, year on year, the dynamics are interesting because, if you look at this Q2
compared to last Q2, a -- by the way, this is a record Second Quarter. It's our best
Second Quarter ever. But if you look at the year-on-year dynamics, PC gaming is up.
And PC OEM is down. And I think that's indicative of the true long-term trends in
those two segments.
So PC gaming we estimate to be growing 10% a year or so as a market. And OEM is
weak. And I think it's probably going to be a long-term weakness. And that's driven
by a couple of things, principally by the fact that consumer notebook market as a
whole is weak, right?
And so, we -- that's our only exposure to the consumer mainstream is through our
OEM graphics market. And that generate -- although it generates a lot of units. So
you'll see it in market share numbers. And you'll see it in attach rate numbers, it
doesn't generate much revenue. And it generates even less proﬁt because the ASPs
are low. And the GMs are low as well.
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
And so, when we think -- when we hear, like, Intel talking about consumer and
emerging markets still being diﬃcult, we should be careful because that's mostly
OEM. IS that --?

Chris Evenden
Mike McConnell-- I imagine that's what they're talking about, yes. And it's -- because I don't think
anyone would look at the PC market and say: Hi. there's a market I want to be a part
of.
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
You guys are putting up pretty good results.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
But -- exactly. But if you -- and that's my point. The PC gaming market is actually a
really good market. It's really healthy. 67 million people play League of Legends
every month, right? And you -- it regularly peaks over 7.5 million concurrent users.
The amount of prize money in the Dota 2 tournament, Defense of the Ancients
tournament in Seattle last month was greater than the price purse in the British
Open, right? They had over $10 million prize money. So there is -- it's a ﬁve -- it's a
team game, ﬁve people on each team. Each team member took home $1 million.
Then the others got less.
So 45 million people post clips to Twitch every month. It's very, very healthy. Then
you've got all these great games coming out in the fall, Assassin's Creed, the latest
Assassin's Creed, the latest Battleﬁeld, the latest Call of Duty. There's a bunch of
really good games coming out. And ultimately, it's games that drive the revenues.
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
And I think another surprise you had to the positive, right, last quarter was Tesla and
Quadro. And so, with Tesla, I guess it used to be kind of a lumpier business. Are we
kind of starting to now see -- and I know you've talked about this, a steadier OEM
adoption now.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
We're getting bigger lumps. We're getting bigger lumps.
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
Yes, (inaudible) problem.

Chris Evenden
Mike McConnellBut do -- can we carry this forward into the back half of the year at this new level, or
is it tough to know?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So it's diﬃcult for me to talk about Tesla because our customers are bit cagy about
what they want us to say. So Tesla I think is -- Tesla's breakout year, if you like, was last
year. That's when it really started zooming up. It grew 37% year on year, largely on
the strength of our distribution channel eﬀectively.
Anyone who's anyone in supercomputers is now selling Tesla as an oﬀ-the-shelf
solution. So whether it's IBM or Cray or Supermicro or NEC, all those guys are there.
We had a very big strategic agreement with IBM, where they're actually looking to
port some of their enterprise applications or their Hadoop analytics, big data
analytics to Tesla. And that's hugely promising.
And also, the other big thing with IBM is they're going to put NVLink in Power V8 so
we can build a really high-performance supercomputer with very fast data
connection between the CPU and the GPU.
So there's a lot of business there. But that's -- the breakout last year was distribution
and code porting. This year, the interesting thing that's driving -- accelerating
growth, if you like, is these consumer Internet companies, these consumer service
providers.
And they are looking particularly at image recognition and speech recognition. And
it turns out that -- it's interesting, isn't it, that some of the things that our brain can do
very easily, computers ﬁnd very diﬃcult.
And so, good speech recognition and good image recognition is computationally
incredibly intensive. And so, they're using some very sophisticated machine-learning
algorithms running on deep neural networks, which run on Tesla and to better serve
you as more aligned with your interests. So it's (inaudible) amount of computer
power just to give you better advertising.
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
Then did this all start to come in fruition last quarter?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
We had a couple of big orders last quarter, yes.
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}

Chris EvendenSo we had Rich at -- CEO of Shazam, the keynote earlier on panel. And he brought
up basically how they're using GPUs inside of the datacenter. Is that unique to just
kind of that speciﬁc kind of Internet use case scenario, or is there -- are you seeing
broader interest in Tesla in the traditional Internet Cloud space?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Well so, that's not speech recognition. But it's akin to. Like, pattern recognition and
massive datasets is I suppose perhaps a broader way of putting it. So Shazam is one
great example. And that's a customer I'm actually allowed to talk about.
Netﬂix has published some research on how they're using NVIDIA as well. But they
haven't given much detail beyond that.
But more generally, I was talking about ads. And so, look. So, this is an example. So
let me -- I want to give a clear example without implying that anyone's a customer or
not a customer. But imagine you post on your social networking site, you post
pictures of your new dog, right? Now, if that social networking company was able to
recognize that that was a dog in that photograph, it would then start selling that
information to dog food advertisers, who would then buy ads on your page, right,
because they're targeting (inaudible).
Or, maybe you could recognize pictures of babies and advertise diapers and so on.
And that's a diﬃcult task, recognizing a baby. It's diﬃcult enough to recognize a
face.
So there's a lot of value in being able to tag photos appropriately, for example. And
so, that's one -- another example.
Voice recognition, driving user interfaces by voice is another one that requires a
surprising amount of compute power, particularly at the training stage when they're
learn -- when you're training the algorithm to recognize words correctly. So Shazam
is a great example. And I like it because I can talk about it. But there are plenty of
others out there as well.
Because that -- Tesla HPC is what % (inaudible) versus kind of now kind of non-HPC
type --?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
-- So we haven't given that breakdown. And the trouble is that, like, it's -- even if I
gave you what it was for Q2, that might not be a useful answer because we had
some big wins in consumer Internet in Q2, which might distort it. And if I gave it toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-08-12

Chris Evendenyou for the year, consumer Internet is new. So that would understate. So I can't give
you a useful answer now.
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
We estimate Tesla was about $50 million a quarter but had a nice jump last quarter.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes. As Tesla as a whole, separate of the whole. But that's right -- that's in the
ballpark. I was -- but breaking it down into consumer Internet versus HPC is not --.
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
-- My words.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes. That's good. That's good.
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
Let's talk about mobile a little bit, right? So Analyst Day, lot of talk about the
Company not -- Tegra, when we're talking about Tegra is all about automotive. And
not a lot about tablets, not a lot about smartphones. People started reading through.
Can you kind of talk about the commitment to both tablets and smartphones longer
term and what we should be thinking about that?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Sure. Well they're both still very interesting markets for us. We have acknowledged
that we've withdrawn from the mainstream smartphone market. The mainstream
smartphone market, frankly, commoditized faster than we thought it would. We
thought there'd be a place for diﬀerentiated products within that marketplace. And
there isn't really. The market competes on price and schedule, pricing, availability.
And that's not a market that we'd ever want to compete on.
So we're still interested in high-end phones. And the ME3 is a good example of
something that's driving revenue for us and tablets as well, the MePad. I suppose it's
no coincidence that both of those was Yowme [ph] because Youme is an aggressive
company focused on growth, focused on diﬀerentiation, ﬁnding a place for itself in
the market.
And so, we can help them with that, whereas, if you're using the same oﬀ-the-shelf
ARM core as everybody else and the same oﬀ-the-shelf graphics core as everybodyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-08-12

Chris Evendenelse, it's really hard to build a new chip or a new device that is actually any diﬀerent
to anybody else's.
So we're still focused on that. We're working really, really hard to build a gaming
ecosystem on Android. We believe that -- this is 1.1 billion unit market this year, that
there's going to be some segmentation on there, just like you've seen on the PC,
right?
So the -- again, the PC market, broadly speaking, doesn't look like a good market.
But gaming on the PC, great market. And I think you can make the same argument
about mobile as well.
Broadly speaking, there are some big challenges in that market. But if you can have a
gaming niche that is defensible, it's proﬁtable. And it's something where you can
really add some value. And you're not a components supplier again, right? You're a
platform provider adding value far and above the value of the silicon that actually
gets sold into the motherboard.
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
And spending on Tegra's about $400 million or so?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes. That's what we -- that's the number we gave you.
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
And you haven't split it out between automotive and the other?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
No. We haven't (inaudible). Also, it gives us a nice solid base that's growing steadily.
So that gives us the opportunity to keep working at building this gaming ecosystem
because that's going to be hard, right? It doesn't happen overnight.
So we've built -- with Tegra K1, we've got a great chip that's capable of supporting
the latest graphical APIs, right? We've ported a bunch of major game engines
across.
So I suppose the one that people are most familiar with is Unreal Engine 4. That's the
one that Google used at IO to demo its new Android. They have that amazing,
incredibly high-ﬁdelity demo. But we've ported Source across so you can see Half-
Life 2 and Portal on Shield now. And we've ported Unity Engine 3, id Tech 5. And
several other engines that I can't name oﬀ the top of my head.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-08-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 11 of 13Mike McConnell
Chris EvendenAnd the thinking behind that is it makes it much less expensive for a game
developer to port their game across to Android to Tegra. So it's a lower-risk
proposition from their perspective. So you spend $60 million developing a title for
PS4 and Xbox.
And so, then the incremental cost of bringing it to Android could be quite low and
certainly low in the context of that original $60 million. I actually don't know what the
number is. But it's relatively low because it's already running -- it's running on the
Unreal Engine 4 on PS4.
So you just now need to run it on the Unreal Engine 4 on Android. So there's some
tweaking you need to do. But it's at the level of tweaking rather than porting, right?
It's not a rewrite. So that's our strategy. There's a chicken-and-egg issue to gaming
on Android. And we're trying to prime the pump, if I can mix my metaphors. But to
get that going.
{BIO 4740633 <GO>}
Okay. Okay. Any questions in the audience? I think we have time for one or two
more. Okay. I've got to ask a question. Intel licensing, will -- what are we supposed to
think of their -- what's the probability you re-up [ph], or how's conﬁdence?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So I'd love to be able to give you, like, a progress bar that says 68% complete, right?
But it's not going to happen, right? It's either 0% or 100%. There's no in between on
this. The Intel licensing. So, it's -- let me take a step back because there's a lot of
misinformation around licensing.
So we have a cross-license with Intel. What that is, is an agreement not to sue each
other. It's not like a recipe book full of clever ideas that they can use to build
graphics. It just doesn't work that way. They don't get to see our patents until they're
published, which is three years after they've been ﬁled.
And all the engineers I've spoken to say: It doesn't happen. You're not sitting at the
bench thinking: I have no problems with this memory interface. I'll go and see what
NVIDIA has.
So it's just an agreement not to sue each other. It's recognition of the fact that we
have thousands of engineers working on clever processor technologies. They have
thousands or engineers working on clever processor technologies. You're going to
overlap and invent the same thing at some point, don't want to sue each other.
The reason it's a net ﬂow of cash to the smaller company is because the larger
company has more revenue at risk from patent litigation, right? So that's what a cross
license is. So actually, we pay them as well. We pay them $6 million for every $66
million they pay us. So that's the cross-licensing deal.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-08-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 12 of 13Mike McConnellNow, that covers all the patents, their patents and our patents in perpetuity after
March 31st, 2017. So as of April the 1st, 2017, we've got no patents that we can sue
them on. However, we've still got 6,000 engineers working on technologies that are
in the same area as Intel. So you would assume, eventually, that we're going to end
up in the same situation.
And so, then it's a question of: Well will Intel want to wait until we take them to
court? Should we think that's the right -- in three years' time when we've published a
bunch of new patents that we think are strong? Or, will then think: Well hang on, our
negotiation position is never going to be as strong as it is today April the 1st, 2017.
Maybe I'll renegotiate for I hope a much better deal. And NVIDIA will get continuity
revenues. We'll get a lower payment. Everyone's happy.
So there's that. But then that's just -- don't take that out of the context of the fact that
we are working very closely with other companies to sign other licensing deals. And I
think we'll see some success there in the next 2.5 years.
And meanwhile, we've got these very proﬁtable growth businesses, Tesla and now
GRID as well I think, that will also oﬀset some of that as well. So it's -- there's lots of
reasons not to think that the sky is falling out. There's lots of reasons to be positive.
As a whole, I would say, as you saw from the last few reports, not just Q2 actually. But
the Company is ﬁring on all cylinders, particularly all through the GPU businesses
and then through automotive as well. Then there's some debate about mobile in
Tegra. But I think we've explained our strategy there and why we're interested there.
So we've got like two minutes left, haven't we? So I think I'll use 30 seconds to say:
PC gaming is really strong. And people want to compare us with someone. They
compare us to AMD. And while, technically, we compete against them head to head
in some markets, if you look at what actually drives our ﬁnancial results, they're very
diﬀerent things.
Someone asked me this earlier today: Why aren't you doing -- why isn't your
business behaving the same way as AMD's? It's like: Because we're driven by
completely diﬀerent dynamics, right? AMD's business is dominated by mainstream
entry-level consumer PCs and consoles to some extent. Our business is dominated
by high-end gaming PCs and workstation and supercomputing and a couple of
other things as well, completely diﬀerent business drivers.
And so, you can't extrapolate from one to the other. And so, it's frustrating when I
see people trying to draw parallels there when none exist. It's a very small part of our
business. The bit that is the OEM graphics is the only area of overlap. And that drives
very little revenue and even less proﬁt.
