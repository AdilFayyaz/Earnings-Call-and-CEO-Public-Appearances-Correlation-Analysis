{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Good morning. It's great to be back in Orlando with all of you. We have over 30,000
people from all corners of the world here and it's great to be celebrating. What you
all do? I ﬁrst wanted to start by saying "A Big Thank you." A big thank you for being
that community, that builds Tech Capability in every organization in the world.
Because what you do and your push, your feedback to us is so important. And today,
and throughout this week, we're going to celebrate that Tech Capability and that
Tech Intensity. In fact, my entire keynote is going to be about Tech Intensity.
Now, as I was coming down, someone told me that there is this new exhibit, at the
Universal Studios, that perhaps best typiﬁes what Tech Intensity is all about. A team
came together in less than 110 days. They built this pretty amazing exhibit. And I said,
wow, to really get into the mood for this morning's keynote, I should go see it. So,
let's roll the video to show you what happened.
(Video Presentation)
Yeah, that's my -- me saving my life. Yeah, I learned a lot about Demo Bargains, but
really, in fact, that entire exhibit was created, as I said, by a group of people from
Universal, who came together and use some amazing tech. Azure Kinect is at the
edge. So this is a great example of the intelligent edge and the Intelligent cloud andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04

Page 2 of 34action. Azure Kinect on the edge did the skeletal understanding, environmental
understanding, then they had speech reco right on that walkie-talkie. Natural
language understanding for the dialog as well as Neural TTS.
And so that in some sense captures the spirit of what we want to talk about. The Tech
Intensity as a formula is something that we've talked about for a while now. It's a
pretty straightforward formula, but there are some nuances. The ﬁrst thing is, how
quickly can you do adopt new technology, because the last thing when you are
building tech capability in your organization is for you to recreate the wheel. You
want world-class input. And then the most key thing of course, is for you to build
your own Tech Capability.
And then trust is of paramount importance. The power law in this equation is all
around trust. Of course, we as platform creators have to care deeply about it in short
trust, but you all, as creators of Tech Capability will also have to treat trust as a ﬁrst-
class construct. Our mission is simply put to empower you to build that Tech
Capability. We want every organization to be a digital software company. And that
means, you all need to have the capabilities to be able to turn every organization
into a digital company. In fact, our goal is to commoditized digital tech. We don't
want it to be just the promise of a few companies in the West Coast to the United
States on the East Coast of China. We want every company out there to be a tech
company, in its own right. And you are the community that's going to make that
happen. And our mission is to empower you to do that.
And today, what I want to do is, walk up the tech stack and talk about how you go
about building that Tech Capability. I want to start at the very bottom of it with Azure
and start building up from there. In fact, I want to have some fun with numbers, just
to motivate each of the layers of the tech stack. When you look at these two
numbers, 50 billion devices by 2030; and 175 Zettabytes of data by 2025, up from
around 40 today. That's what's motivating us. That's what is motivating the need for
us to build Azure as this distributed computing fabric; as the worlds computer.
We have over 54 data center regions, more regions, than (Technical Diﬃculty) it has
the right certiﬁcations. It's supporting all of the digital sovereignty rights, all over the
world. It's also open, both Windows and Linux, Java and.NET, Kubernetes, Redshift,
VMware, Oracle, SQL Server, Postgres. So every layer of the stack there is openness.
And of course as we build out this global footprint, sustainability is of paramount
importance to us. In fact, this summer we launched a new data center design that is
zero waste and 100% renewable energy. It's so exciting to see this. This is going to
roll out in Sweden, and it's going to spread throughout every region of Azure. And
so we are really ensuring that the power utilization eﬃciency of every work load, as it
moves from traditional data centers to the cloud is something that's contributing to
the sustainability.
Now -- yeah, you can clap for that. Now, when we talk about the cloud, it doesn't end
in the cloud. In fact, the cloud in the edge form that distributed computing fabric.
That's been at the core of our vision, our design point, for how we built Azure. And
we want to make sure that there is consistency in the management control plane.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 34Natalia Mackevicius
Satya NadellaThere is consistency in the development environments, as well as the infrastructure
across the cloud and edge. It's so critical. When you're building distributed
applications, you need that consistency. And of course that has been our competitive
advantage and today we want to push that even further. The ﬁrst thing we're doing is
extending the Azure Edge family with some tremendous new innovation. And I
wanted to throw it out to Natalia, on the show ﬂoor to show you some of the latest
innovation on Azure Edge. Natalia?
Thanks, Satya. I'm on the show ﬂoor where you can see the full spectrum of Azure's
Intelligent Edge portfolio. Edge computing requires processing data closest source.
The Azure Stack portfolio of products can make all of your edge computing needs.
Azure Stack Hub provides a full hybrid cloud on-premises. It's an integrated system
that includes an Azure consistent cloud control plane. It delivers Azure services such
as server list computing with Azure functions and Azure Kubernetes engine to
simplify Kubernetes deployment and management.
Azure Stack Hub can run in connected or fully disconnected scenarios, literally
irrigate from the public network. Azure Stack HCI, lets you deploy high performance
at the end in your own software deﬁned data center and connect to Azure for cloud
services, such as Azure Backup, Azure Monitor or Azure Security Center. There are
over 150 hyper-converged solutions oﬀered from 20 hardware providers. Azure's
Tech Edge systems or Azure Managed appliances that bring compute storage and
intelligence to any edge.
First is the Azure Stack edge commercial series. We are continuing to add new
services and functionality to Azure Stack edge. For an instance, we're adding the
GPU option as seen in this system for NOP processing and inferencing. We're also
enabling private cellular networks as a service by adding the tech preview of Multi-
Access Edge, MEC and Azure Stack edge. We've expanded the Azure Stack line up
with the new rugged series. It oﬀers the same capabilities as the commercial series,
but ruggedized and even portable for using harsh or disconnected environments.
This rugged series systems is small enough to ﬁt into a backpack. It's portable and
with less than GBP10, including the battery, allowing you to run Azure services for
things like disaster relief, search and rescue or even mining. And all the Azure Stack
edge oﬀerings are available directly as an Azure service from Microsoft, ordered and
managed from the Azure portal; no initial CapEx required, no minimum commit. As
you can see, we have hardware solutions from compute to storage, all the way to AI
and Mixed Reality devices. Come see our full spectrum on the show ﬂoor.
Back to you, Satya.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thank you so much, Natalia. It's great to see the innovation on the Azure Edge. And
in fact, we see tremendous customer momentum already. If you look at GOJO
Industries, the creators of Purell. They're already using Azure IoT to build, in fact,
standardization solutions for hospitals. They're in fact, going to use Azure SphereFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 34Aaron Ogusgoing forward for even better detection and control loop. We have Johnson
Controls building out a complete new bad solution for smart buildings that uses
facial recognition and some of the cognitive capabilities in Azure IoT with the
container on the edge, as well as Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which is obviously
running a regulated workloads all on Azure Stack at the Edge. So these are just good
great examples today and with what Natalia showed, we expect this momentum to
continue to really meet the world's needs out there for distributed computing.
Now today, one of the most exciting announcements for us is this next big step
forward in hybrid computing. I'm really thrilled to announce Azure Arc. Azure Arc
really marks the beginning of this new era of hybrid computing, where there is a
control plane built for multi-cloud, multi-edge. And not only that, but we for the ﬁrst
time support managed data services to be anywhere your computers. So again,
managed data services that are multi-cloud, multi-edge. We also have two open
source projects that allow you to build these cloud native distributed applications,
both of new programming model that simpliﬁes enterprise application development
and a deployment model. And to show you all this, I wanted to throw it out to Aaron
on the show ﬂoor.
Take it away, Aaron.
Thank you. Satya. I'm excited to show you how we fundamentally redeﬁned hybrid.
So you can bring Azure innovation to your data center, virtually anywhere.
Imagine, I'm responsible for IT operations that would grow back. Here's my IT
dashboard. Now, I'm responsible for managing a heterogeneous environment with
increasing systems sprawl and data silos. And it's my responsibility to deliver the
agility of the business demands, while ensuring the compliance and security of the
entire state. With Azure Arc, I can manage all of my resources seamlessly from the
Azure portal [ph]. Extending management capabilities, Azure management
capabilities to my data center.
Now through few simple steps, I can connect my data center to Azure. We ran
through the steps moments ago, on this HPE Superdome Flex here on stage. And
momentarily, you'll see my Orlando data center show up as an Azure location. There
it is. Now with Azure Arc, I can extend Azure Data Services to my data center. My
bank is rolling out a new risk management application. Let's see how Azure Arc
fundamentally changes the game. So within the Azure marketplace, you can see
preview container instances at the Azure SQL DB and Azure Database for
PostgreSQL. My risk management application runs on Azure SQL DB. So I'm going to
select. I'm going to choose to deploy it to that Orlando data center I just created and
click creates.
Now what we're deploying is the same Evergreen version of SQL available only in
Azure. Typically, deploying a DB into a VM on-premises is a lengthy process that can
take hours. But as you can see in a matter of seconds, I was able to install Azure SQLFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 34DB to my data center. Even better, I now have access to all of Azure's unique security
capabilities. So I can enable advanced data security and that risk management
database can take advantage of Azure capabilities like advanced threat detection
and vulnerability assessment. And I can enable this by default with the policy. This is
a ﬁrst for on-premises customers.
Let's see what else Azure Arc can do for me. My Chicago location, another Azure Arc
location is running a number of Azure Arc enable data services. Here I see an update
reminder. Now typically updates and patching, as a task that requires constant
diligence. I know that Azure automates this for me, but what about Azure Arc? Well,
with Azure Arc, I can automate updates in accordance with my bank's policy. So I can
specify a custom maintenance window, or I can enable automatic patching and
never have to worry about a single updates.
Back in my IT dashboard, I have another warning. This time the PostgreSQL
Hyperscale database that's powering my mobile banking applications is reaching a
CPU limit. Now typically in this scenario, provisioning the servers and the databases
to deal with this unexpected spike in demand, is very time consuming. But Azure Arc
understands the capacity available in my data centers, enabling me to scale out on
demand. And with PostgreSQL Hyperscale, I can add instances to power that
application. I can even scale to over 3,000 nodes is needed.
Back in my IT dashboard, I see that VCO [ph] increased the CPU and then is resolved.
And I was able to scale out, just as I do in Azure with no application downtime. Now
let's take a look at how Azure Arc simpliﬁes IT management and governance for my
organization. Most of that workloads that are running in my Chicago data center are
running in containers and Kubernetes. With Azure Arc, I can manage Kubernetes
from within -- as reported, here are my kubernetes clusters that are across Azure Arc
locations.
Now the security is top priority for the bank. And with Azure Arc, I can create a single
policy that will encrypt the discs that are running on the data basis on the clusters,
across on-premises and Azure. So I don't have to worry about the application, the
database where it's running, who is running it, I can rest easy knowing that my data is
secure, all with the single policy. This is another ﬁrst for on-premises customers.
Now as a global bank, I need to serve my customers 24/7 worldwide with minimal
downtime. With Jio replication in Azure Arc, I can easily replicate from one on-
premises location Chicago to another or to an Azure Data Center or even to AWS.
This is a ﬁrst, again this time for the industry. So as you can see, Azure Arc uniﬁes my
operations, enabling consistency and agility across all of my data centers. Azure truly
is the worlds computer and its innovation is available at my ﬁngertips. And this is just
one example of how Azure's innovation is empowering customers to achieve more
across on-premises and multi-cloud at the infrastructure and data services layer.
Now let's take a look at another example. This time at the application layer, where
we're simplifying the programming model and deployment of cloud nativeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 34Satya Nadella
Rohan Kumardistributed applications. A great example of a distributed system is the railway
system with millions of kilometers of railway track around the globe, creating a
complex network of interconnected parts that almost work seamlessly. It's really
challenging. Owners and operators must make decisions on their own and with
limited information. And with no interconnected, interface between those railways,
it's a challenge. And even with the system is complex, as the railway minimal
downtime could have serious implications.
We will well believe there was a better way. They teamed up with Strukton, our
Maintenance Operator to create a digital twin solution in Azure, creating a
comprehensive and real-time view of their network. The Willow well distributed
application has powerful insights, which will enable decision makers to predict false,
optimize utilization and increase eﬃciency. Now we recently released two new open
source projects to help our partners like Willow and Strukton. Jaafar provides a
simpliﬁed cloud-native programming model for distributed applications and rather
simpliﬁes the deployment and management of distributed applications irrespective
of where they reside. We look forward to seeing what you do with these innovations.
Back to you, Satya.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thank you so much. Aaron. It's fantastic to see the innovation enough there. The next
layer of Azure, but again it's very diﬀerentiated and very important is the data layer.
To support again your data estate needs, last summer we made some giant strides in
around operational stores. We brought Hyperscale SQL and with Cosmos DB, you
now have the support for the variety, the velocity, the volume, your scale needs, of
course the cloud and edge needs for operational data stores.
And today, I'm really thrilled do announce Azure Synapse. We are taking the same
approach of using the cloud-native memory hierarchy and storage hierarchy, to
redeﬁne the rules around analytic workloads. We want to bring together what until
today have been two separate categories; data warehousing and big data. That
means your unstructured and structured analytics can be brought together with
unprecedented scale. Azure Synapse changes the game around analytics.
To show you all of this, let me throw it over to Rohan on the show ﬂoor.
{BIO 19488761 <GO>}
Well, thank you, Satya, and good morning, everyone. For the purpose of this demo,
please imagine that I'm a product manager at a gaming company. We've recently
launched a new mobile game, and I'd like to analyze our telemetry to signiﬁcantly
enhance user engagement. No matter what the public cloud platform building end-
to-end analytic solutions, it's really hard and project timelines are measured in
several months.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 34Welcome Azure Synapse analytics. Synapse is the next generation of the Azure SQL
data warehouse, which blends together with data analytics, data warehousing and
data integration into a single uniﬁed service that provides end-to-end analytics at
cloud sale. As you see on the screen, synapse makes building. These complex end-
to-end pipelines into a simple intuitive visual no code experience. With Synapse,
project timelines will be measured in hours and not months.
In addition to empowering users to gain quick access and insights across all of their
data, Synapse enables a whole new level of performance and scale that is simply
unmatched in the industry. Let's take a look. What do you see on the screen is that
analytics application that's followed Azure Synapse. Now to essentially analyze end
user engagement, I need access to a variety of data, including the current
engagement times, end game to extremes, obligation metrics and telemetry data
from our device partners, in short petabytes of data. With the Open Data Initiative,
accessing additional high value data from systems like Adobe is really simple.
Now to start, I'd like to ﬁnd out the longest playing duration of players for feature
with the total playing time is less than 20% of the average playing time ﬁltered by
user demographics and add-on feature names. Now this may sound like a simple
query, but it's actually quite complex, because we are accessing a joining data across
multiple very large disported data sources. In fact, a key part of Synapse is the ability
to query both relational and non-relational data at petabyte scale pleasingly fast
using an on-SQL [ph] language. Let me issue the query against Synapse.
Now what's happening behind the scenes, is the Intelligent distributed query
optimizer of Synapse is executing this query across of hundreds of nodes in a fault-
tolerant manner, wow, it just took nine seconds to execute this complex query
against the petabyte scale data set. Now, in the interest of some friendly comparison,
let me run the same query against Google's BigQuery. Now, what I'm doing is
running the exact same query against the exact same data set running in Google's
BigQuery. Now as you can see it's taking a little longer, now the interest of time, we
ran this query earlier. Any guesses on how long it took Google's BigQuery to
complete this inquiry? Two minutes? Five minutes? Eight minutes, maybe? Let's take
a look. It took a whopping 11 minutes. So for this complicated query, Synapse is 75
times faster than Google's BigQuery.
Now TPCH is a very comprehensive benchmark for analytics. The current state-of-art
for TPCH is 30 petabytes. I'm really excited to announce that with Synapse, we have
successfully run all the 22 TPCH queries and record time at one petabyte.
Now let's take a look at a diﬀerent capability of synapse. Query concurrency has long
been a challenge for all analytics systems. Now to showcase how Synapse empowers
users with limitless scale, I have a dashboard here that compares it with the other
oﬀerings in the market. Now what's backing this dashboard is a system that allows
me to issue concurrent user access using industry standard benchmark queries. Let's
start with 50 concurrent users. As you can see even with this fewer user said,
Synapse, based on the query response times is three times faster than Amazon's
Redshift, and ﬁve times faster than Google's BigQuery.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 34How about raising the stakes a little bit. Let's go to 150 concurrent users. As you see
on the screen, while Synapse continues to do great, we've head the limits with both
Amazon's Redshift and Google BigQuery. The Redshift starts queuing request at
around 100, resulting in signiﬁcantly increased query response time and a vastly
degraded end user experience. BigQuery users actually have a worse experience by
default BigQuery starts failing request beyond 100. So, if you happen to be the 101st
user, you're out of luck. How about raising the states to true enterprise scale? Do you
think Synapse can handle 10,000 concurrent queries? Let's try it out. Well, as I can
see in the stage, Synapse is easily able to handle 10,000 concurrent users. What
you're seeing on the screen is it working ﬂawlessly with 10,000 concurrent queries
operating on the system.
Now let's take a look at a couple of our additional capabilities of Synapse. As you
see on the screen, we've deeply integrated Synapse with Power BI making them the
best combination in the industry. For example, you can build Power BI reports and
enterprise with semantic models, right from within the Synapse's work space. With
this level of deep integration between Power BI and Synapse, business users can
gain insights that may need to make their data driven decisions in a timely manner.
Synapse also deeply integrates with Azure Data share, enabling secure sharing of
data and insights both within an organization and across organization with your
partners with just a few simple plex. Now some of you may be wondering, what's the
magic behind Synapse. Well, to achieve this limitless performance scale and true
simplicity, you've completely re-architected the analytics stack on Azure from the
ground up. Speciﬁcally, we've merged data lakes and data warehouses into a single
system that essentially enables querying across both relational and non-relational
data.
We support true online elasticity through a cloud-native design, that separates out
our compute and storage layers, so that they can be scaled out independently. We
have intelligent multilevel caching, which leverages that memory hierarchy and SSDs
in an eﬃcient way to give you the best price performance for workloads of any size
and scale. Our credit scheduling is workload aware and we support multi master
clusters that would share data sets giving us inﬁnite concurrency and scale.
Finally, Synapse supports both a server-less query service and a cluster based form
factor for both Apache Spark and ANSI SQL, enabling all the analytic workloads that
you can imagine. Well, a modern analytics platform all this stuﬀ is cool, but what
about predicting the future? Isn't a modern analytics platform supposed to do that?
Well, with Synapse's deep integration with Azure machine learning, you can scale
out build and operationalize complex and very powerful machine learning models
right from within the Synapse's workspace. Let me show you how.
I'd like to predict the propensity or the likelihood of our user base actually buying in-
game add-ons, ﬁltered by age demographic. Synapse enables me to do this by
actually writing a pretty -- modeling a simple query that also includes native scale out
machine learning based scoring on the Synapse nodes. Let's see how the query
works. As you saw, the response times was near instantaneous and I got myFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04

data professionals. Azure is the only public cloud that empowers users with limitless
performance scale and insights. Analytics in Azure is simply unmatched. We can't
wait to see how our customers use Synapse to digitally transform themselves.
Back to you, Satya.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thank you so much, Rohan. As Rohan was describing, not only do you need to build
this limitless data estate, you need to make sure that you can do AI compute close to
that data. And so our goal has been to democratize AI by building out the best
infrastructure in Azure for doing AI and creating your own AI solutions, providing you
the best most productive framework and tools with Azure ML, as well as pre-
packaged AI capabilities with Cognitive Services for speech, and language
understanding, computer vision, and we continue to push the frontiers of it and it's
great to see the customer traction. In fact one of the things that I sort of every day
check is just start to think about and see the customers deploying this in real world
solutions and you see Spotify for example using cognitive services to change how
they do podcast. In fact you can edit a podcast by just editing the text, because of
this text to speech capability. You have the Atlantic taking 160 years worth of their
content using Azure search turning it into a knowledge base. You have nationwide
insurance using the BOT framework to build their customer facing conversational
agent. ASOS a fashion retailer and a fashion brand is using the decision system in
Azure ML to build their recommendation engine that's improving their yield. So
great use cases and this is one of the most exciting areas of what's happening with
application development on Azure,
I wanted to talk about three areas where we're pushing the boundaries of where
computing is going. I want to start with Autonomous systems. When we think about
autonomous systems, the ﬁrst place we go to is autonomous cars, but in fact
wherever there is a control loop today, you can think about AI driven autonomy. In
fact that's our goal with autonomous systems. Across industries to build out, whether
it's industrial applications, whether it's energy whether it's robotics, how do we
create that autonomy and it's a couple of key elements. First is to really push the
boundaries of reinforcement learning, so that you can build an AI engine that's
capable of driving autonomy, but the one of the things that's important for us is to
take engineers who today build these control systems and turn them into AI
engineers by really helping them teach machines.
So we have a new paradigm called machine teaching, where the engineers are
teaching these AI engine by putting constrains even giving it safety bounds so that
you can now have autonomous systems that are driven by engineers' domain
knowledge. Of course you have a stimulation environment where you generate all of
this synthetic data and these machine teaching labels in order to be able to train
these models and then ultimately to be able to pick the right model to drive the
autonomy. Recently DARPA had a challenge a subterranean challenge and Carnegie
Mellon University along with Oregon State were the ones who won this
championship using the Azure autonomous system, and it was pretty fascinating.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 34There was a mine in Pennsylvania where you had to have this autonomous system go
ﬁnd object in fact they won because they found two times the number of objects
compared to their competition and they were able to ﬁnd objects within 20
centimeter distance of where they were located right completely autonomously and
it's fantastic to see that type of progress and what we are very, very excited about is
to see ﬁrst of all, even partnerships we have with MathWorks where they bringing
simulation engine to Azure to in fact enable more of this simulation driven
autonomy, as well as really the application across many, many diﬀerent industries
and I wanted to give you a feel by rolling a video of some of the use cases, let's roll
the video.
(Video Presentation)
The next areas I want to talk about is storage. Again core part of compute and so
one of the things that we are thinking about is how do we change the game again in
storage? We were inspired by the use case from Warner Brothers. Now Warner
Brothers stores some of the most iconic movies of all time, Superman, Wizard of Oz
in storage systems like the one you see in the picture behind me. Now, of course, it's
all in ﬁlm, it's in a temperature controlled room and that means it's fragile. If there
was any kind of drop in temperature or if there is any kind of other issue, you lose in
fact originals of Superman. Now that would be a tragedy. Now, what we said, okay,
what if we sort of re-thought this? What if we can take a piece of glass. This is just a
regular quartz glass and using femto lasers we were able to etch into this glass, the
entire Superman movie. Now what is fascinating about doing that is, ﬁrst of all you
encode it in multiple -- multi-dimensional space inside of the glass and so therefore
you need to be able to read it using machine learning algorithms and so we've built
this entire system that's fully capable of essentially our new cold storage system. But
the interesting thing of course is the reliability of this piece of glass. So we add some
-- and we put it through the ringer, we boiled it, we baked it, we shook it around. We
tried to scratch with wool and we still have the Superman movie and so that's the
frontier of new storage systems and we are really, really excited about working here
with Warner Brothers and bringing new innovation to even core storage systems
going forward.
Now the last area around pushing the frontiers of computing, I want to talk about is
quantum. We have always been very focused on trying to build a general-purpose
quantum computing environment, because today with all the capacity we have
around computing, we still have many unsolved problems, right? Whether it's
around food safety or climate change or energy transition. These are big challenges
that need more computing. But we need general purpose quantum and so, it
requires a diﬀerent type of approach, it requires a platform approach and today I'm
very, very excited to announce Azure quantum and it has three elements to it.
First, it is about open hardware, we are very excited to have partners, two ion trap
IONIQ and Honeywell, so this is, they make machines that trap ions and then a
superconducting partner QCI joins us with in fact, our own quantum eﬀort with
topological qbits, which is also super conducting machine. So we'll have a variety of
hardware solutions that are going to be all opened in Azure. Now of course, if youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 34have a variety of hardware, the ﬁrst thing you want to do is build and open software
ecosystem on top of it. And so we have built that, with Q Sharp which is open source,
QDK that's open source and so we have built that with Q#, which is open source, and
QDK, that's open source.
And today, we're also pleased to announce 1QBit also joining with their simulation
machine learning capabilities on Azure, and so to build a complete toolkit for
software developers to get started on building quantum computers and quantum
algorithms.
Now, one of the most interesting things about quantum is that you can get started
with quantum algorithms on top of classical, and because of the simulation
capabilities that we have. Now, we've seen, in fact, many use cases already, across
healthcare, across ﬁnance, and the electrical grid, as well. But, one example that
stands out is what Case Western Reserve University, along with the Cleveland Clinic,
have been doing. I want to roll the video to give you a feel for how you can do
quantum-inspired work on classical computers.
(Video Presentation)
Now, as we build out all these tech capabilities, one of the most important
considerations for all of us is trust. This is something that we're very focused on, as a
platform provider, trust across privacy. We have to enshrine privacy as a human right
in the systems we build. We have to consider the ethics of AI. The models that we
deploy into production have to ensure that there is no bias built into it. We have to
improve the state of the art of the development processes with things like machine
learning ops and data lineage, so that we really ensure that AI is safe.
But what I want to talk about today is cyber and security, and simply because of this
number, just last year, the total amount of cost of cyberattacks was $1 trillion. And the
sad part of this is that the people who are most impacted by this is small-to-medium
businesses, all over the world, and consumers.
Therefore, it is our collective responsibility to do our best work to ensure that the
most vulnerable of these populations are protected. That's why we've focused on
this end-to-end security architecture, from identity, to devices, to cloud applications,
to information and data, to infrastructure. How do we have one integrated
architecture, and opening it up, in fact, for all third parties using the security graph to
participate, as well, because we need the ecosystem's support, or to have that
consistency in architecture.
Now, especially with the management control planes now, one of the most exciting
announcements of Ignite is going to be the Microsoft Endpoint Manager that brings
together the comprehensive management control planes for all endpoints. In Azure
Arc, you know can really deploy the security policies. Not only can you ﬁnd the
vulnerabilities, but you can deploy the remediation, to all end points, all
infrastructure, and all data. That's what we mean by the end-to-end architecture.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04

Page 12 of 34There are a couple of use cases. There was an attack on 10 smaller pharma
companies. And it was a phishing attack. It was a social engineering attack. First of
all, in most cases, 95% of the time, the ATP capabilities in Oﬃce 365 were able to
catch it, and even if it went to the endpoint, the Microsoft Defender was able to catch
it. That ability to have defense in depths is so important when end-to-end
architecture support is so important.
Rapid Deploy is a company that builds mission-critical software to handle emergency
calls, 9-1-1 calls, And so each municipality deploys their software, and unfortunately,
some of these deployments have been attacked, especially one recently in North
Carolina, which was attacked by ransomware, and now though Rapid Deploy is using
Azure Sentinel. It's continuously monitoring all of the deployments, ensuring the
security of their entire estate. And this is great, again, to see how this end-to-end
architecture and the ability to proactively mitigate on cyberattacks, is being used.
Now, I want to move up from infrastructure and trust to the next layer, developers.
Now, this is obviously close and near and dear to everyone at Microsoft because this
is how we, as a company, got started building developer tools. But one of the most
interesting things that's happening out there is, today, when you look at the software
engineering jobs, 61% of the openings are outside of what is considered the tech
industry. In fact, the crossover, the tipping point was 2017, and therefore our mission,
that we got started in 1975, is even more important. This is to build the best tool
chain, the most complete tool chain, for developers.
With Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, we have the best ideas out there for
doing language innovation like type script, we have Azure DevOps to help you with
all of your build and deployment needs. And, of course, GitHub is the home for 40
million-plus open source developers in collaboration and communities. And sort of
bringing all of that, is what our goal is. In fact, the use cases, some of these sort of
innovations that you'll see, I'm really thrilled about. The ﬁrst one is Visual Studio
Online. I mean, you should check this out. Even just last night I was going in and
playing with it. I signed up for it. It's so -- it's a gamechanger for anyone who
struggles on weekends to create your own dev environments. This is a godsend
because you now can go to Visual Studio Online. You can get your entire
environment provisioned for you, with all its dependencies, right there, just on a
browser, on any machine.
Another one is IntelliCode. We're using AI, learning from all of the open source code
out there, on GitHub, and then bringing that intelligence to your editor. As you type
your code, it's doing all of the completion so that you can build on the shoulders of
the giants, and that the way it drives productivity.
Another one is Live Share. Now, just imagine what it can do for a young developer
who joins a team and wants to have some code reviewed, or goes -- consult with a
mentor, Live Share changes the dynamic because no development project is a solo
sport; it's always a team sport.So it's really bringing that next level of innovation with
GitHub and Live Share, changes the dynamics and culture of organizations. We see a
fantastic adoption of this tool chain from companies like Stripes, to the VeteransFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04

organizations are changing, using these tools, let's roll the video from Comcast.
(Video Presentation)
And as we talk about developers, it's not just the professional developers who are
building applications. One of the phenomenon you see is citizen developers getting
involved in a very deep way. In fact, it's motivated by the fact, we are going to have
500 million applications that are going to get created, new, by 2023.
That's just to kind of put in perspective, more than all of the applications that were
created in the last 40 years. And so that means we need to empower citizen
developers with tools that are low-code/no-code tools so that they can build out
these applications, and that's what Power Platform is all about. In fact, there are
already 2.5 million citizen developers using Power Platform, and it's great to see this
community. And one of the things that inspires me to listen to their stories, it's that
feeling if empowerment, of making a diﬀerence, building that digital capability in an
organization, perhaps most truly comes through from this community. Let's roll the
video to hear from them.
(Video Presentation)
All right, so it's a really awesome to hear those voices because I think that what this
community is doing is perhaps going to build the most digital capability, and help
democratize digital technology all over the world. And today, I'm really thrilled to
take the next big step forward in terms of the tools that will be at the disposal of all
of the people who use Power Platform. Today, I'm really pleased to announce two
new members of the Power family: Power Automate and Power Virtual Agents. Power
Automate brings full robotics process automation to the Power Platform, along with
a lot of other capabilities. And Power Virtual Agents bring language understanding,
using the bot framework, with now full language understanding and conversational
capabilities to the Power Platform so that you can build these virtual agents.
To show you both of these, let me it throw it out to the show ﬂoor, Charles, to show
you Power Automate as well as Virtual Agents.
Thank you Satya. For over 40 years, TruGreen has helped homeowners create
beautiful and healthy lawns. And one of the most important ways they engage their
customers is with the TruGreen websites.
And in the past, if a customer wanted to schedule an appointment for a TruGreen
agent to come out their homes, they had to call the 1-800 number during business
hours, a very lengthy and painful process. However, with Power Virtual Agents,
TruGreen has been able to completely transform how they engage their customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 14 of 34Their customers can now just walk up and report the actual issue that they're facing,
and this will go use Power Virtual Agents on the backend
To identify common issues that can be causing that problem and it even integrates
with the TruGreen knowledge base so that it can pull back all of the relevant
information for that particular problem.
And on top of that, with all of that additional information, I can even go and start to
schedule an appointment. And just by providing my email address, it will actually go
to the TruGreen backend, cull their scheduling APIs, and ﬁnd the next spot, the best
time for me to have an appointment. And just like that, I'm able to go and book a
TruGreen agent to come out to my home, something that used to take hours, but
now just takes a couple of minutes. But what is really special about it is how they
built it. TruGreen use Power Virtual Agents, the newest addition to the Power
Platform, which makes it possible for everyone in the world to go create chatbots
without having to write any code.
The way that Power Virtual Agents works, as you can see on the right-hand side of
the screen, a visual designer that captures the entire chatbot experience, as well as
the AI that backs it, and on the left-hand side, something called tracing, which makes
it easy for you to actually watch how your customer interacts with that chatbot. So, if I
go and run through the same set of steps as I was doing before, we can see that on
the right-hand side of the screen the Power Virtual Agents chatbot will automatically
start showing all of the diﬀerent steps, as they run through. If I zoom in here, we can
see all the diﬀerent user responses that I oﬀered, and if I go back out, you can see
that this is exactly what the customer sees in their chat experience, as well.
This just continues to advance through, using all kinds of great AI capabilities,
without requiring code or data science. Now, if I want to go and schedule an
appointment, that requires pulling out for the TruGreen backend system. To do that, I
used Power Automate. Power Automate has over 275 diﬀerent connectors which
make it possible to connect all your diﬀerent business applications, right out of the
box. So, when I provide my email address, that is actually going to that backend
system, and looking up the next-best time for me to have an appointment to send a
TruGreen agent out.
And for this next part, when I conﬁrm that I want to have this appointment, you can
see that it's using Power Automate, again. However, the system I want to interact with
is a contact management system which is legacy and Win 32 app which doesn't have
any APIs. The only way I can talk to it is through the UI, and that's where the brand
new UI ﬂows capability of Power Automate comes into play. It makes it possible for
me to just record a series of steps on my desktop which will then run in the
background as part of my standard Power Automate workﬂows. Just to show how
easy that is, I can launch the TruGreen contact management application. I can go
take an input from the virtual agent, or the email for the user, paste that in there, and
I can then go and click "search" after I do that, and that will actually make it so that I
can go search that particular record, in that contact management system.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 15 of 34Satya NadellaSo, I switch over to the "save the activities" tab, and then what I want to do is, I want
to capture all of the outputs from that chat experience because that information will
be useful for the TruGreen agent when they go out to the home. That makes it
possible for the customer to have a complete end-to-end experience with TruGreen,
all integrated and highly automated.
When I click "done" then I can switch back to Power Automate. You can see, inside
that same web-based Power Automate visual designer, all of the steps I just recorded
are visible. If I expand each of these individual steps, we can see the search box, the
text command, and all of that information is captured, in a truly automated way,
allowing me to very easily record this information in a contact management system.
Now, I'm switching back to Power Virtual Agent. Once I conﬁrm this appointment, it's
actually going to go and trigger that UI ﬂow that I just ﬁlled. What this is going to do
is, it's going to capture all of this information I was just entering inside the chat box,
opening up that Win 32 application, simulating all the same keyboard inputs and
mouse clicks that I just did. This uses three diﬀerent types of rules in AI to make sure
that I've selected exactly the right controls in that UI automation, making this
incredibly robust and durable.
And this is a great example of how, when you use the Power Platform, you can do
two really amazing things. The ﬁrst is without writing any code. Anyone can be a
developer, completely transforming how your business operates. The second is that
you can do all of this without replacing your back oﬃce software or systems.
Between data connectors and UI ﬂows, we can connect to anything in your business,
making it easy and actually aﬀordable, completely transforming your company in a
very short period of time. To show another great example of this in action, we're
going to roll a great video from the American Red Cross.

It's great to see all of that innovation in Power Platform. But, most importantly, and as
I said before, it's great to see how it's democratizing how applications and
technology is being built everywhere, by domain experts, citizen developers, the
people who are closest to solving some of the hard challenges.
Now, going up one level in the stack, business process. One of the things that is
going to deﬁne the competitiveness of every business going forward is going to be
how well do you harness the power of all of the data that is there in your enterprise
to drive the transformational outcomes for your company.
It's not about other people using your data; it's about how good are you at driving
your business process using the data you have. That's core to what we are trying to
do with Dynamics 365.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 16 of 34Dina ApostolouIn fact, today, when you think about the amount of data there is, one of the sad facts
is 73% of the data is not analyzed. That means you're not able to drive that next level
of automation, creating that next level of predictive power or analytical power,
because that's going to deﬁne competitive advantage.
And our goal with Dynamics 365 is to build out that world-connected business cloud
so that you can harness all of your data to drive the productivity of your business
process. That means you want to create these digital feedback loops across all of the
key elements -- people, operations, products, customers; all of that has to come
together. In fact, an AI-ﬁrst company is a company that knows how to take data from
one system and change the outcome of another system. And that's what we
endeavor to do with Dynamics 365.
In fact, a great example of this is the Customer Data Platform and Customer Insights.
This is all new innovation in Dynamics, and it typiﬁes this change in paradigm from
being reactive to data to being proactive with data. How do you take all of the data
that you have in the enterprise and bring it together with all sources? In fact, we built
the data platform -- in this case, Customer Data Platform and Customer Insights -- on
top of Azure Synapse, so it builds up all that rich platform capability. That means all
of your enterprise data can be brought in.
And then, on top of that, you can operationalize AI at scale. So, you can build these
customer segments to drive the next level of experience. But those customer
segments are not being created by just using data in a CRM system. It's using all of
your data, so if you want to target someone for sustainability eﬀorts, you want to be
able to take your supply chain data and bring it into your segment creation. Of
course, it has to be extensible, and all of the Power Platform capabilities come
together. And you also want to bridge. One of the things that we're very excited
about is how business processes are changing by bridging what is physical and what
is virtual.
And AEP Energy is, in fact, using Customer Insights to just do that, and it's a great
use case of how all of the data can be brought to bear in changing the customer
experience. And to show you that, let me throw it out to Dina on the show ﬂoor.
Thank you, Satya. AEP Energy, a retail electricity and a natural gas supplier to more
than 400,000 residential and business customers, is transforming their business
model from buying and selling electrons, which have become commoditized, to
consulting with customers to help them make the best energy decisions that are
eﬃcient and sustainable.
The challenge is that they don't have a holistic view of their customers because data
is residing in disparate sources. The foundation to deliver an exceptional customer
experience lies in the ability to have a uniﬁed view of your customer. AEP is using
Dynamics 365 Customer Insights to create a 360 degree view of their customers andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 17 of 34re-imagine how they're servicing them by infusing the insights into their business
processes.
Let's go take a look. Today, energy managers are unable to provide real-time
recommendations to their customers. With Customer Insights, the new customer
data platform solution from Microsoft, we've enabled AEP to create that master
proﬁle that comes together with customer and real-time product usage data, and to
discover high value segments based on solar propensity.
They were able to create that consolidated proﬁle without the need for complex
integrations using our prebuilt connectors. They brought together Dynamics 365,
utility usage from regional transmission organizations, and weather data. This
aggregated dataset lands in Azure, meaning you have full control of your data while
being backed by security and compliance from Microsoft cloud services. And with
this data sitting in Azure, you can run powerful analytics with Synapse.
With the AI and machine learning capabilities of Customer Insights, AEP can now
precisely identify customer segments to target with energy recommendations, like
this one here: high energy consumers. This data and insight can be translated in real
time to inﬂuence how AEP employees better sell and service their customer. For
instance, AEP can proactively dispatch an energy manager to go onsite. The energy
manager can see all the speciﬁc device details for that anomaly with their behind-
the-scenes meter or a generator. And looking here, they can see that this customer is
in the high energy use category, and an alert indicates that they can beneﬁt from
alternative energy options.
When looking at this customer detail further, I see all that rich information from
Customer Insights -- the full contact information, a timeline of activities. But the thing
that I see most here at the top is the spike in energy use on hot days that exceeds
the network capacity. The intelligent recommendations are telling me that the
customer could beneﬁt from solar as a way to reduce their energy consumption by
35% and ﬁx energy as a way to limit the expected rising costs.
Now, seeing is believing, and I want to make sure that the customer has conﬁdence
in their purchase decision. With Dynamics 365, and the Product Visualize, and the
power of mixed reality, I can help they customer explore solar panels right here in
person.
Now, solar panels can be extremely complex and technical, but seeing them taken
apart makes it far easier to understand. Instead of videos and brochures, Product
Visualize allows the energy managers to help the customer to better understand the
product, creating a more conﬁdent purchasing experience at the real world scale of
using mixed reality. This notation feature allows us to quickly highlight in context with
data, as well as existing marketing materials, like this note here about polycrystalline
wafer, which, when compared to monocrystalline, absorbs sunlight better in partially
cloud climates like Columbus.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 18 of 34Satya NadellaNow, all of this information is linked in the Common Data Service, so that allows us to
use predictive data modeling to get an accurate estimate of the customers' cost
savings over the next ﬁve to 10 years. What makes AEP unique is their consultative
approach to helping customers make the best energy decision. Microsoft and AEP
are partnering together to bring data, AI and mixed reality to create that 360 degree
view of their customer so they can personalize every customer experience. Together
with their customers, AEP is redeﬁning the future of energy and developing
innovative solutions that power communities and improve lives.
Now back to you, Satya.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thank you, Dina. I'm here at the Modern Work portal to talk about the next layer of
our stack with Microsoft 365, and empowering the knowledge workers and the
ﬁrstline workers. In fact, the two stacks that motivate all of our work here is 25 and
40%. It takes 25 minutes to get back on task when you're multitasking, and you lose
something like 40%of your productivity.
And so, with all this abundance of computing around us, what is scarce is human
attention. And that's why we are building the world's productivity cloud with
Microsoft 365, to help you focus on things that matter the most to you. And the way
we're doing this is by starting by putting people at the center of it all. It means we've
got to really think about how they express themselves, how they communicate, how
they collaborate, how they create knowledge inside of the organization. That's what
drives all the innovation across Microsoft 365.
But it starts with device innovation. Devices are the most personal things in our lives,
and we want to make sure that we are bringing the best in class innovation, starting
from the silicon to new form factors. We just recently had the Surface launch where
we really pushed the envelope of creation of new categories and new types of
devices. And right behind is the wall of all devices from Surface and all of the
innovation in our OEM partners and ecosystem. It's great to see this come to life.
Now, ultimately, we want to drive new experiences that take advantage of these new
devices. We want to infuse AI into every experience out there. We're infusing AI into
PowerPoint; presentation are more persuasive. Data is more actionable in Excel.
Videos are more searchable, and stream and emails are more acceptable through
Cortana.
Microsoft Teams has been a breakout experience. It brings together for the very ﬁrst
time in one user experience scaﬀolding, chat, meetings, collaboration, as well as
business process. And 350 organizations with over 10,000 users are using Teams
already, so it's really amazing to see the momentum around Teams.

Now, the next step forward for us in M365, or Microsoft 365, is knowledge. If you
look at it, you're using your devices. You're using these applications. You're creating
perhaps the most valuable data about your people, their relationship to other
people, the expertise, the artifacts of work; all this today is raw data. We want to
convert that into knowledge that accrues on a continuous basis. This is, again,
putting your data to work for you.
And so, I'm really thrilled to announce Project Cortex. And Project Cortex takes what
is data today inside of your organization and converts it into knowledge. You now
have AI-driven topics, so essentially you have AI creating topic wikis inside the
enterprise. You have the ability now in the context of any document or any mail.
For example, if you get an email with an acronym, you can look up what that
acronym means because AI, again, has gone to work. It can work that data into
knowledge. But more interestingly, you can ﬁnd the experts who know something
about that acronym, and you can really integrate and interact with them.
You can also interrogate a document. You can have a conversation with document.
Say you're looking at a contract. You can ask the contract, "When is the ﬁrst payment
due?" That's, again, converting data into knowledge.

across Microsoft 365 and Surface. Think of this as the holiday wish list to help you
unlock products across your entire organization. Let's start with the newest service in
Microsoft 365, Project Context. As Satya just shared, Project Context bring together
the power of the Microsoft Graph with AI, people, content and apps into an
interactive knowledge repository. It sounds complex, but we've made it incredibly
simple to use. I'll show you.

brings me to an AI-generated knowledge network that pulls together experts on the
topic, as well as content, like presentations, videos and conversations, all curated for
me in this pattern map. This is a great way to ramp up new team members or share
knowledge across an organization.
Here in my knowledge network, I notice a stream video from an expert in the ﬁeld.

Understandably, there's a lot of background noise when you're onsite. However,
Microsoft Stream's new voice enhancement feature uses AI to drop out that
background noise so I can focus just on what's being said. Let's listen to the
diﬀerence with this feature on.
That's so much better. And you may have noticed I've been doing all of this on the
brand new Surface Pro X, our thinnest two-in-one ever. It's always ready with my new
Surface Slim Pen ready at my ﬁngertips because it charges while docked right here in
our new signature keyboard. So, I can jump right in to a brainstorm using the
Whiteboard app and inking.
Hello, Sonia. Looks like you're already in here.
Yup. I'm in the same Whiteboard experience here on the Surface Hub 2 S, which is
perfect for team collaboration and also, now, mobile. Using the new templates in
Whiteboard, we're able to easily organize our thoughts, assigns tasks, and it even
sums up ideas that you agree with. But here, let me show you one of my favorite
features. So here's an image of a ﬂoor plan. I'm going to select it, hit the "ink grab"
tool, and using AI, it's going to convert this into digital ink. So, I can come in and edit
it as if I had drawn this directly into the Whiteboard myself. Pretty cool, right?
But we know Teams are going remote, so we want to showcase a few AI-powered
experiences that will help create more personal connections in meetings. So here,
you can see all of my teammates looking sharp on this 4K+ resolution screen. You
know how, oftentimes, people look disconnected when you're in a video call
because they're looking down at their screen as opposed to up at the camera? Well,
this person's using the Surface Pro X, which supports new EyeGaze technology. The
AI corrects the direction of her gaze so it's looking as though she's looking directly
at me. Also, nice oﬃce background you've got going on over there.
But we know not every conference room has a Surface Hub yet. We have some
teammates who are joining on a call in a conference room with a physical white
board, so we're not really able to easily follow along with their notes. But fortunately,
they're in a Teams room with a dedicated Whiteboard camera. Using AI, the camera
detects the edges of the white board and zooms in. But the real magic is that it alsoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04

Let's bring AI and voice into the mix with Outlook. Show me emails from Jordan with
attachments. Using Microsoft Search with natural language, Outlook gives me just
the emails from my colleague, Jordan, where he shared a PowerPoint attachment
with me. This is such a more natural and easy way to search.
I also like to use my phone to capture images of information I know I'll need later.
So, I'm going to use image-to-table in the new Oﬃce app to take a photo of this
dataset here. The Oﬃce AI will recognize it and analyze it, and convert it into a real
Excel table for me. I don't have to manually enter the data or format the cells. It's all
done right here. And now that it's a real Excel table, I can easily continue to work
with it or share it with my team. And this is so important because, as you know, we're
collaborating with more teams than ever before around the globe. At Build, we
announced a new collaboration platform called Fluid Framework. Fluid works by
breaking down documents into component parts that can be collaborated on in real
time across diﬀerent applications. Fluid previews in just four weeks, so I'm super
excited to show it to you in action today.
Here we are in a Teams chat where you can see diﬀerent folks form the group
collaborating on a document together.
Jump on in, Sonia.
Sure. So, I'm here in Outlook. I was sent the same table in the body of an email. I'm
able to see your edits coming in from Teams, and you should be able to see mine
coming in from Outlook. I can also use this data to create a pie chart and it'll all be
connected on the backend, just like how it is here on this PowerPoint slide on my
brand new Surface Laptop 3.

I love Fluid because I can continue to collaborate even while on the go. Here, we see
the same table on my mobile phone. Now, notice there's the missing data here. I'm

Unidentiﬁed SpeakerAll right, that was a whirlwind tour of 12 AI and hardware experiences. But we have
two more to show you for next year's wish list. A few weeks ago, we announced our
vision for a new category of dual-screen devices: Surface Neo with two nine-inch
screens running Windows 10X, and Surface Duo with two 5.6 inch screens running
Android, both available holiday 2020. We're so excited for you to start using these
amazing innovations from Microsoft 365 and Surface.
Now, let's head over to Dr. Balshi from the St. Luke's University Health Network.
Hi, good morning. St. Luke's University Health Network is a non-proﬁt with 10
hospitals, 300 ambulatory sites, a medical school, a nursing school and 15,000
employees. We have a mission, an unwavering commitment to excellence, delivering
care to our community, educating our physicians and nurses, and improving access
to care for our patients.
For me, it's personal. I was born at St. Luke's, and I, like many of my colleagues, have
spent my entire career there, often caring for each other's families. Working with
Microsoft, our physicians, our nurses and our technologists have started to manage
the overwhelming tsunami of healthcare information that inundates us every day.
Microsoft 365, and in particular, Microsoft Teams, is allowing us to reduce our
administrative tasks, to organize our patient care, and to collaborate with
teleconferencing and ﬁle sharing, secure text messaging.
The Microsoft employees who work with us at St. Luke's have become like family.
They understand our culture, our work ethic, and our priorities. They've helped to
empower and move our organization forward in digital transformation, and that's
something we're really excited about at St. Luke's.
Now, I'll turn it over to my friend, Yousaf Saijid [ph], who's going to tell you some
great things about Teams.
Thanks, Dr. Balshi. Today, I'm going to show three scenarios on how St. Luke's uses
Teams and Microsoft 365. Care teams needs to be in constant, and at
Times, urgent communication with each other, but that can be especially challenging
when you have 15,000 people spread across 10 diﬀerent hospitals, like they are at St.
Luke's. But with Microsoft Teams, they can stay connected through chat, audio clips
or even video calls right from their phones. They can easily use a smart camera to
take a photo of something like a patient's skin condition. They can mark up the
image right in Teams so the Care Team knows exactly what to follow up on.
Next, they can ﬂag the message as urgent so that the right specialist who might be
miles away at a diﬀerent hospital can respond at the right time. Now, the best part isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 23 of 34that the image is not stored on their personal device; rather, it's saved on the secure
M365 cloud, which enables the Care Team's HIPAA compliance.
Now, in addition to improving internal communication, St. Luke's has looked for ways
to transform clinical processes to better patient care outcomes. To ensure doctors
are continuously improving and providing the most empathetic care to patients, St.
Luke's used Power Apps to develop their own patient experience app. The app helps
to gather and provide feedback to doctors during their rounds. Right from their
phones, clinicians can select the doctor they're shadowing, and then, right in the
app, they can score the patient and provider interactions.
They can even put qualitative feedback around topics like provider duties. Once
they're done, they can hit review and get an individual summary of the feedback that
was shared, and an overall score. Now, the data from this assessment and across all
the assessments are ﬂowed into a Power BI dashboard using Power Automate. Here
the leads of each specialty can review individual performance data, realize any
performance trends and approve quality across the entire network of hospitals.
Now, a core part of St. Luke's mission to improve patient care is ensuring that the full
context of the patients' care history, including those notes outside the health
records, naturally follows them to every interaction they have, regardless of the
clinician they're seeing that day. Microsoft Teams integrates electronic health record
systems via a FHIR extensible interface. This healthcare interoperability standard
enables data interoperability in Teams. Now, what this means is that providers like St.
Luke's can bring in relevant medical information from their systems of record into
one central hub meant for collaboration.
Here, all the providers in surgical oncology can get a list view of the patients they
care for. They can then click on a patient and get up-to-date information from the
EHR, like medication. They can then improve those critical patient data hand-oﬀs by
inputting notes around care logistics, in this case, a patient needing to fast prior to
procedure in the morning. They could even dynamically collaborate around this
information like through video in a team huddle, while knowing that they're on a
secure platform.
It's been incredible to see all the ways that St. Luke's is using Microsoft 365 to
improve patient care, but now I want to show you something new. Today, we're
announcing Virtual Consult, a feature in Teams that will be available to customers
across all industries. And in healthcare, this type of patient provider video
collaboration can help networks like St. Luke's reach even more people.
Here, an administrator can access a scheduling view of clinicians in the Care Team.
They can book a consultation by inputting relevant notes, like leading notes and
consult-type. Once done, they just click "send." At that point, the patient receives an
email with a customization and Teams meeting link to join. The best thing is that they
don't even need a Teams account to participate. They just need a web browser and
they can join in one click. So before the meeting, the doctor can turn on aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04

them. And once they're in the meeting, they can engage with a patient, who may be
at home, or they may be at a diﬀerent hospital quite all together.
Hey, Travis. We're going to begin by sharing your test results. This was a quick
glimpse as to how Teams is transforming healthcare, but Teams is a hub that adapts
to any industry. Whether you're in retail, manufacturing or ﬁnancial services, it uniﬁes
everything your organization needs to communicate, collaborate and move your
business forward.
Back to you, Satya.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thank you so much, Melissa, Sonia, Yousaf and Dr. Balshi. It's great to see all of
innovation across Microsoft 365. So the last piece of innovation we want to talk
about is the web. When you think about what's our usage of the web, in fact, 60% of
our time on PCs does get spent in the browser. But we still have some very big
questions. The real question is can we expect more. Is our data safe, and private, and
protected? Why can't we ﬁnd the information inside our organization like we do on
the web? And why doesn't the web work with all of the productivity tools that we use
every day?
And to try and take a step forward and ﬁnd answers to these questions, we are going
to innovate across both our browser in Edge, as well as Bing and Search. And to
show you all this innovation, let me throw it out to Yusuf on the show ﬂoor.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Thank you, Satya. Here at Microsoft, we think the time is right to expect more from
the web. And we hear this from everyone -- IT professionals, developers, every day
people. So today, we're going to unlock a whole new wave of innovation to
empower you on the web. I'm going to start by focusing today on people in
business, and our goal is to bring, really, the best browsing capability and search
capability to deliver you the best experience on the web. Now before I get in and
show you all the cool things that are going on, let me address the elephant in the
room. Some of you out there might be thinking, hey Microsoft, what's changed over
the last 10 years in browse and search that will make you be really competitive?
Well, I would like to welcome you to the new Microsoft Edge. Today, we released a
new browser update that is going to address three big things that we've been
wanting to do to get in there and be super competitive. First is we now release
separate from the operating system, so we ship at internet scale every four to six
weeks we're doing innovation. Second is we're going to run now on all platforms
that you have in your company -- iOS, Android, Mac, Win 7.
And last and most importantly is, about a year ago, we moved to the Chromium
browser. What that has allowed us to do is now deliver for you world-classFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 25 of 34performance and compatibility. These are the two key things.
Let's start with performance. Here on the left side of the screen, you'll see the old
Edge, and on the right, you see the new Microsoft Edge. We are over twice as fast.
We now rival Chrome in terms of performance for rendering web pages. Second, on
compatibility, as you would imagine, we are now perfect matched compat our
websites, so now you can rest assured you've got world-class tools.
Now, with those things, we can start to do some things that go beyond and innovate
on that and push the boundaries. I'll start ﬁrst on one on performance and one on
compat.
Let's start with performance. What I wanted to introduce for you today now is the ﬁrst
personalized homepage that is unique for everyone that speeds you to what you
want to get done. What's going on under the covers here is I'm logged into my
Azure Directory, so the system knows about me and it knows about the Microsoft
Graph. So, I get specialized links and data for me, so the speed to get to action from
the page is dramatic, and only we can do this on Microsoft because of the Graph
and Azure.
Secondly, what we do is we're going to push the boundary forward on compatibility.
You can believe that you can even be more than 100% compat, because today, 75%
of Fortune 500 companies run more than one browser. They run Internet Explorer
and a modern browser, like Chrome or Edge.
Let me show you this. This is an IE legacy site that we actually run at Microsoft for
time reporting, and when I click on it, I get a separate IE instance. But what you see is
it's actually inside of Edge. So now, you only have to have one browser to manage
your entire estate. That's a massive time savings, massive management savings.
All right, second thing is privacy and security. This is a top concern for all of us. If
you're an IT professional, you already know that we're world class at managing and
securing your data state. But today, I want to show you show you some things we're
doing to empower us all as individuals. And I want to focus on privacy and security.
Let's go ahead and start ﬁrst with some of the privacy. So today, when we all surf the
web, behind the scenes, we don't really realize it, but a lot of tackers and cookies get
dropped on the machine. So in this slide, for example, I'd go to weather.com. And
what you'll see is that over 66 trackers are loaded onto my IT piece for this site from
average surﬁng. But what you see below is we've blocked 62 of them, and part of
that is because we are taking a new, more protected stance to help you on the web.
So what you see here is this is the conﬁguration page, which you don't have to go to,
but we give you three options now: Basic, which is how the web works; Strict, which
is we really control all tracking and we reduce personalization; or Balance. Balance is
what we do by default. This is more protection than you get from any other browser.
So if you want to really have your data and your privacy secure, you're going to wantFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 26 of 34to go with Microsoft Edge. The other example of what I want to show you is
Incognito. So if you search today and you use Chrome, Chrome's got a great feature
called Incognito that keeps your browsing safe and private. But what you don't know
is you can be accidentally logged in if you're on Gmail, and your search is on private.
Let me show you the new capabilities now with Microsoft Edge and Bing. I go into
InPrivate, but look at this. When I start to navigate to a page, we will actually prevent
you from being accidentally logged in, right? We keep you InPrivate, and when you
type in searches, all those searches are kept just on the machine. They don't go back
to the server. So if you want the most private way to search and browse on the web,
you're going to want to go with Edge and Bing. All right, the last big pillar of work, I
have two things I want to show you: How you can start to get more knowledge out of
the web, as Satya talked about it. Today, the web is this incredible research tool, but
it's hard to collaborate.
So let me give you an example. I'm an IT professional and I'm looking to put
together a set of recommendations on PCs to buy. So today, what we do is you'd
send around links. But now, look at this: I can create a separate Collections page on
the right. And what I'm able to do now is, as I surf, I can kind of drag and drop things
over. I can add whole pages. It's kind of like a scratchpad. And so, here I go to
Amazon, I go to Best Buy, and I pull in the computers I'm looking to see. Not only do
those pictures come over, but all the metadata comes over. So now, you've got it in
one place. You don't have to email these things around in links. And then, when I
want to share it, with one click, I can come in and I can just share that, and now I can
share with people. If you're doing a personal example, I can share with my family.
And here's some pretty magical stuﬀ. Watch this. I can say, 'Export to Excel,' and in
the back and automatically, we gather all the data from those web pages and drop it
into Excel. Yeah, how cool is that? Look at that. This is all live data. You've got reviews.
You've got ratings. You've got prices. These are powerful tools to harness knowledge
out of the web. All right, last but not least, I'm going to save the best for last here. We
want to really now do a big thing forward that we can only I think uniquely do a
Microsoft. We want to unite the internet with the intranet, the ease of use of how you
surf the web with the power of your own data, right?
So let's take an example. Today on the web, the web is magical. You can ﬁnd
hundreds of millions of documents in sub-second time, but how many of you have
had that problem where you can't ﬁnd the document you want inside of the
company? Everyone here travels. You want the travel site so that you can do your
booking. Does anyone know the SharePoint travel site? I don't. But watch this, now.
Within my own browser, within my own search engine in Bing, I can start to type in T.
I get web results, but look at this. I also get the links inside my company, and with
one click, I get taken right to the Microsoft -- in this case, my travel site -- and there's
the SharePoint URL. Take a look at that green URL. I'd have never remembered it.
Today, we go one step further, though. So 76% of the information in companies is in
unstructured data, but we now can read that data just like you can read on the web.
So if you've ever used Bing to say, "Hey, how tall is the Empire State Building, orFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 27 of 34What's the weather today?" and we answer at the top, what if you could do that
within Bing today? Watch this. Let's say I want to ﬁnd out how many days can I take
oﬀ for jury duty. I can just type that in, and as I type that in, up will come not just the
website but the actual answer, 10 days at Microsoft, and you can see it. So, we can
read the web semantically and pull it out.
Here's another one. I've got two dogs I love. I want to know can I bring my dogs to
work. I can just type in, can I bring my dog to work, and we will go in and ﬁnd this
thing, which is very obscure inside the company, and what we'll see here is not only
does it give you the pet policy, which is unfortunate, I can't bring them in unless
they're a service animal, but we didn't even have dog show up, it had pet policy. And
that's because we have an understanding of the semantic web. So, imagine now
being able to query all of your intranet and just use basic English to answer the
question.
Here's my favorite, Power BI is a new way to run companies and get access to your
data. Now when I'm looking for sales of the new Surface laptops we launched a few
weeks ago, I can say, give me the Power BI for multi-sales overview and I get it right
there. I don't know the URL, I get the link. And if I want to look at all of the other data
around there, I have one-click link and now I can pull up all the Power BI dashboards.
So, that's what's great for intranet-searching.
Now let me show you people search at the next level. So, I'm going to do a trip to
England and I want to meet with Sophia. I type in Sophia and I get this real beautiful
contact card. Now, what you don't sort of know that happened is in the background
the Graph knew, oh, Sophia is probably most relevant for me because of emails
we've exchanged. So, you would each get a diﬀerent Sophia in your company. But
what I want to do now is I want to do something more complex. I know I'm meeting
with Sophia, who's in engineering. So, I can just add to my query, hey, Sophia in
engineering, and then I get the Sophia in engineering. But I'm actually traveling to
London, so I want the Sophia that's in London. So, I can just use natural language
and it will ﬁnd the Sophia that's most relevant to me. This is Sophia Morta. She's in
London. That's the person I want to meet with. And now look at that contact card. I
can get access to all this great data to go out there and meet with her.
So, for example, I want to come out and ﬁnd out where her oﬃce is. All those oﬃce
maps that are in your corporate service, you can now get one link and I can turn
around and ﬁnd out where we're going to meet and it will help me save time as I get
to London. And I can also use that on my phone. So, with your Azure Active Directory
you're logged into your iPhone or Android phone, you can now get access to all
those company resources right oﬀ your phone.
And best of all, if I want to prepare for the meeting, I can come in and look at the ﬁle
that she's shared with me, so I don't have to go and search my emails to say, hey,
what were those ﬁles? They're all right there with one click of a button. And if you
look closely, the ﬁles aren't just from Microsoft sites, there's one there from Box, and
that's because today we're making a bunch of announcements to create newFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04

other content in there like Box and SAP and Salesforce and ServiceNow.
In fact, today, I'm pleased to announce that over 100 connectors are coming online
that will help you be able to get access to all of this great content, and they're
coming empowered by some of our ecosystem partners who are providing these:
Accenture, BA Insights, and Ration.
So, what you'll see today is if you want the best browsing and search experience,
today we are announcing the release candidate, the ﬁnal release candidate for
Microsoft Edge is available. Go up and download it now if you want to have the best
and most private browsing experience. Our ﬁnal version is coming January 15th in
over 90 languages. And for IT professionals we're going to put this into the Fast
Track program, so we're going to help you make all the deployments easy, and there
will be sessions later today to talk to you about it.
And all your sites will automatically work, including your legacy sites in IE11, they'll
work automatically. But if they don't, you let us know and we'll ﬁx them for free with
the new App Assure. So, we think it's time to expect more out of the web. We're
excited to unleash whole waves of innovation. Today's a big step forward for
business. You'll hear more about what we're doing for developers and for everyday
people coming next spring.
With that, back to you, Satya. Thank you very much.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thank you so much, Yusuf. We're very, very excited about all the innovation across
Edge and Bing. So, I want to close where I started, with our mission to empower
every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more, it's all about
creating that tech intensity, that tech capability inside of every organization. And we
started the day with Stranger Things, which typiﬁed in some sense tech intensity. I
want to end by talking about another fun experience, Minecraft Earth.
We started the launch of Minecraft Earth around the world and, in fact, tomorrow it
will launch in the U.K., but we wanted to give you a demo of playing Minecraft Earth,
which brings together some of the core capabilities of the cloud with this iconic
game and turns the real-world into a playing ﬁeld. So, let's have Saxs and Neena
show us Minecraft Earth.
Thank you, Satya. We're excited to be here today to talk about Minecraft Earth, a
brand new Minecraft in augmented reality. We've been wanting to bring Minecraft to
the real world for some time now, but the problem is like how can we give players
the same experience no matter where they are or what they do, and doing that at
scale is a pretty hard problem.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-11-04

get like quick resources, jump a rabbit, carrots. That's useful. Or if I want a fully
