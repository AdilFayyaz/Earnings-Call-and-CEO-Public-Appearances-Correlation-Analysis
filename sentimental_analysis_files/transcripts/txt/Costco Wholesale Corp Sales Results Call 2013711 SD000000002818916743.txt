started on Monday, June 3 and ended on Sunday, July 7. For comparable sales
results, this ﬁve-week period is compared to the same ﬁve-week period last year,
speciﬁcally Monday, June 4 through Sunday, July 8.
June included 34 selling days for both years, reﬂecting business closure in the US
and recognition of the Independence Day holiday and closure in Canada in
recognition of the Canada Day holiday.

In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights for the
month of June were as follows.
On a regional and country basis, US regions with the strongest results were Texas,
Southeast and Midwest. On an international basis in local currencies, we saw the
strongest results in Canada, Mexico and Japan.
Moving on to our merchandise highlights, the following comparable sales results, by
category, exclude the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Food and Sundries comparable sales for the month were in the mid-single-digit
range. Within Food and Sundries, the departments with the strongest results were
Cooler, Frozen Foods, Deli and Candy. We experienced a slight amount of inﬂation
during June in Food and Sundries compared to last year.
Comp sales results for Hardlines were also up mid single digit. Better performing
departments were Lawn and Garden, Health and Beauty Aids and Automotive.

for the month. Produce and Service Deli experienced the strongest results. Fresh
Foods experienced slight inﬂation for the month compared to last year.
Within the Ancillary businesses, Hearing Aids, Gasoline and Pharmacy produced the
best comp sales increases.
Gasoline comp sales were up high single digit year over year. The average sale price
per gallon was plus 2% higher at $3.65 this year, compared to $3.56 last year.
Overall, gasoline price inﬂation had a positive impact of about 0.25% on June comp
sales. Comp gallons were up year over year.
Weakening foreign currencies year over year relative to the US dollar resulted in a
detriment to our reported June sales of about a little over 0.5%.
Total international comps for the ﬁve-week period came in at plus 8% in local
currencies. But resulted in a reported comp of plus 6% when converted to US
dollars.
The average transaction increased year over year approximately 1%, which included
a negative impact from foreign exchange and a small positive lift from gasoline price
inﬂation. Comparable traﬃc or frequency was up just under 5%.
Cannibalization for the month of June had a negative impact to the total Company's
comparable sales of a little over 0.5%. That's pretty much in line with recent results.
Looking ahead, July sales will include 20 selling days for both years. The reporting
period will end Sunday, August 4 and will be compared to the four weeks ended
Sunday, August 5 last year. We plan to announce the July sales on Thursday, August
8.
