per gallon was minus 1% lower at $3.27 this year compared to $3.29 last year. Overall,
gasoline price inﬂation had little impact on December comp sales results.
Weakening foreign currencies year over year relative to the US dollar resulted in a
detriment to our reported December sales of about minus 2%.
Total international comps for the ﬁve-week period came in at plus 7% local
currencies. But resulted in a reported comp of plus 1% when compared to US dollars.
The average transaction was down approximately 0.5% year over year, which
includes a minus 2% drag or impact from foreign exchange.
Comparable traﬃc frequency was up. It was up about 4%.
