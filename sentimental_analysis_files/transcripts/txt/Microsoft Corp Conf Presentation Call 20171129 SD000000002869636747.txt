Good morning, everyone. Day 2 of the CrÃ©dit Suisse Annual Technology
Conference. Thanks for joining us. We are thrilled and delighted to have Dave
O'Hara, who is the CFO of Cloud and Enterprise, Oﬃce, Dynamics, AI and Research
for Microsoft. Dave, welcome.
Thank you.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
And before I begin, I was asked to read the safe harbor statement for Microsoft.
Before we begin, Microsoft may make some forward-looking statements during this
presentation. And you should refer to their SEC ﬁlings for the risk factors relating to
their business. And that's true whether you're here in person or listening on the web.

With that out of the way, Dave, welcome. Maybe if -- for the audience members, if
you could just give us a little bit of a background in your role at Microsoft.
Sure. Thanks. Well the simplest way to describe me, Michael, I think is that I'm the
CFO for the commercial business, which includes our Cloud business. And that cuts
across Cloud and Enterprise and Oﬃce and Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Research and
many other areas. So that's my current role. Came in to Microsoft through the
acquisition of Great Plains many years ago, worked in the Dynamics business for aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

A - David M. O'Harawhile, was the CFO for the online business and CFO for Oﬃce and then Cloud and
Enterprise. And then it all sort of came together.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
So basically, everything kind of grows at Microsoft is what you're responsible for.
Not everything. But I would say that it's a unique position as Satya pushes for more
unpredictable and consistent growth. We have a lot of levers that we can pull. And
so I think within that remix, there are a lot of really good healthy growing businesses.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
So you've been at Microsoft for over 17 years. And so you've seen a couple diﬀerent
CEOs in that position. Satya's come in. What do you attribute the success of
Microsoft over the last couple of years?
Well there's a couple of things that -- some decisions were made when Steve was
still the CEO. Like investing in Azure, for example, was a decision that was made
originally under Steve's watch. And Ray -- a guy by the name Ray Ozzie, who I'm sure
people know, was the original founder of that. Steve was there when we started to
move to Oﬃce 365. Steve was there when we decided to get into the CRM online
business. And so a lot of that stuﬀ had -- was started many years ago. And I think
what Satya did is really to step on the gas. And he just said, hey, there is -- the world
is moving here faster than we thought. And we need to get there faster than we
thought. And so he drove just better agility and acceleration, I think, as we moved to
the cloud. And we were able to move resources over there. And we were able to
catch up. And in a lot of the cloud services, we weren't the ﬁrst mover. But I think we
did a good job, especially on something like Oﬃce 365 where Google Apps was a
cloud oﬀering ﬁrst. I think we did a really good job catching up and passing them
and becoming the market leader. And so I would say, the simple answer for me is
Satya drives sort of the cultural shift in terms of agility and acceleration and really
focusing on growth.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
Does this feel like a new age for Microsoft, completely diﬀerent than it's been over
the last ﬁve years?
Well if you're there, I think it's harder to see sort of the instant change. I think the
market perceives that there is some instant overnight change. And there really
wasn't. It was more over the course of a few years. I do think we're in a better
position than we were. So if there is an incentive of the new age, I just think we're
better positioned. We're better positioned in the cloud. We're better positioned
even in SaaS, in the Oﬃce 365 oﬀerings. And so overall, I think the company is better
positioned for growth than it was ﬁve years ago.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

What excites you the most over the next 1 to two years at Microsoft?
Well the cloud business, we had some lofty goals and expectations for the growth of
our cloud business. And we've even exceeded those. And so we would sit in a room
and talk about how big it could get and how big the market could get. And we had
some pretty big numbers. And I think we're all sort of -- we thought we'd get big, we
didn't really know how big. And I -- as far as the nearest we can tell, it's actually
exceeding our expectations on how fast the market can grow. And so I think we're,
again, well positioned to grow in the cloud on Azure. I think Azure's had a really
good couple of years. That's due to a lot of hard work and a lot of forward thinking
and working directly with a lot of customers. And so I think the cloud business is by
far the most immediate opportunity for us to grow. Longer term, the work that we're
doing in AI has some really great applicability to customers. I think it's very early days
in AI. But we've been doing work in AI and doing work with machine learning for a
lot of years. And so I think the key for us is to be well positioned as a company. And
then once you see something taking oﬀ, just be able to have the agility to move the
resources there and invest in it.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
Well let's dig in a little bit on the cloud and enterprise piece. We ran a survey or a
couple of surveys over the last 12 months. And we -- in those surveys, the enterprise
reaction was -- we saw an inﬂection point for Azure. And we saw that in the ﬁscal Q4
results when you actually showed a reacceleration of growth there. What do you
attribute that reacceleration in the Azure business to?
Well I think there's a few things. One is -- and you guys sort of remember these
meetings after the fact. But I remember having a meeting a few years ago where we
just said, look, we really need to double down on the engineering. We need to get
this working better and faster. And we need to build out more services within Azure.
And we did. And we just -- we made a bet. And the bet -- I think the bet has paid oﬀ.
We hear from customers that the Azure service is in a much better shape. We feel it's
much more competitive. We have diﬀerentiation in some very key categories like
hybrid. And so I think we just made some bets a few years ago that are starting to
pay oﬀ. And we're starting to see that. The other thing is that I think we're candidly
just better at selling it. It wasn't something that came natural to us. We're used to
selling on-premise products in an enterprise agreement environment. And we had to
ﬁgure out how that goes. So an online product in the consumption environment.
And it took us a while to get our sales force there. But I feel like the sales force has
ﬁgured it out. And we're able to articulate the value prop better. We work -- I
personally work very closely with many of the big deals that we -- with customers.
And so I think we're closer to the customer. We have the value prop down, the
services better. I think all of that adds up to faster growth.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

And what are those conversations like with some of your largest customers? And
how have they evolved as you're selling cloud and Azure to those large enterprises
over the last, let's say, 3, 2 and one year ago?
Well I just -- I even think 3, two years ago, there were still people saying, do I need to
move to the cloud? And if I do, when does that all need to happen? And we're kind
of past that point. Any customers that we talk to are clearly in the mode of we need
to move to the cloud, which I think points to the TAM expansion, the acceleration
and the growth in the market and the market being even bigger than we might have
thought. And so there's not a lot of debate anymore about whether or not they
should move to the cloud. It's like how should we move to the cloud. I think there
was a lot of fear at ﬁrst for customers because they thought you need to move from
this environment to this environment. You need to move from on-prem to cloud. I
think that's one of the things that's caught on with our hybrid oﬀering is we're
saying, look, it doesn't need to be that dramatic. You don't need to just pull
everything over at once. And so being able to oﬀer some services in the cloud and
some on-prem and have them all work together, I think that's probably what's
resonating the most with customers. And so the shift for me over the last 2 or three
years is they all get it. They all get they need to have a cloud strategy. But now they
also get the fact that it doesn't need to just be one or the other, that they can migrate
over there in a more responsible and reasonable way.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
One of the things that I talk with investors -- well, the question that I get from
investors is about sizing the opportunity in the IaaS and PaaS and SaaS environment
and the overall cloud opportunity. It sounds like the hybrid approach is an expansion
of the TAM that we know in cloud. How do you guys view and size the market
opportunity in cloud?
Yes. It's a good question. And we resize it frequently, I would say. We look at it every
six months and every year and just say, where are we at? And the good news is it
gets better. I think it has also been the assumption around Microsoft. When we talk
about hybrid, there's been the assumption again that our on-prem products will just
sort of fade away and then the cloud will grow. And the question was always, that
could grow faster...
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
The cannibalization.
Cannibalization. And we've seen -- the Windows server as an example, we've seen a
lot of our on-prem products continue to grow while we're also growing the cloudFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

Page 5 of 18Q - Michael Barry Nemeroﬀ

Q - Michael Barry Nemeroﬀ

Q - Michael Barry Nemeroﬀbusiness. And I think that reﬂects the success in the hybrid strategy, which is people
don't want to just throw out what they've invested in. They have a lot of money
invested there. They have a lot of hardware investments that they want to make sure
they make use of. And so they look at the cloud as more of let's move some stuﬀ
over, let's do our new stuﬀ in the cloud. And then over time, we'll get there. I
honestly don't even know what over time means, like what's the Windows server
business look like 3, ﬁve years from now? Right now we feel good about our
Windows server business. And we continue to see decent growth. And as long as
customers are happy and as long as we can enable it to work and to coexist in a
cloud environment, I think we'll continue to have customers.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
What is Microsoft's best guess as to what % of workloads are in the public cloud
today versus still in -- behind the ﬁrewall? And where do you think that could -- what
do you think that look -- could look like, that ratio over the next, say, ﬁve years or so?
Yes. I mean, I don't know if I would call this Microsoft's best guess. But I would say
some of the numbers I've seen here that -- like 10% of the workloads are in the cloud.
I would make an argument that, that might even be optimistic. We might not even be
there yet. And so I think we still have lots of opportunity to move workloads to the
cloud. And so I think that will take place not over the next year or two years but more
like over the next 5 to 10 years. Then I think even 10 years from now, we'll still have --
I think we'll still have some folks running some stuﬀ on-prem. And so it's just going
to be a hybrid environment for years to come.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
As you talk to these large enterprises, do you think that the hybrid cloud -- the
hybrid approach that you have gives you a distinct advantage over competitors in
the market?
Yes. Absolutely. I think we're uniquely positioned that way and that we're the vendor
that can go to them and say, hey, this on-prem stuﬀ that you've been running, we can
continue to support that and take care of that and help you run that well to have
these cloud oﬀerings. And you can do all that. And the only person you need to go --
the only company you need to go to for support is Microsoft. So I think just -- a lot of
times, people look at legacy as something that might hold you back or a boat
anchor. We don't see it that way. We see legacy as a great asset because we have all
these customers running these products. And our responsibility is to make sure that
our cloud oﬀerings work with those existing products so that they don't have to go
through some nasty transition, just bailing into the cloud. So I think there is no other
company on the planet that has that array of oﬀerings that we have.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}

workloads to the cloud, what are the demand drivers of the shift to the cloud thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

Q - Michael Barry Nemeroﬀ
A - David M. O'Harayou're talking to them about?
Well the one -- there's 2 that I would point to, I think, that are probably the most
pronounced. One is they don't want to be left behind. They want to make sure that
they're current. They have the best technology. They -- it's -- so it's a competitive
advantage for them. They just look at they can get a competitive advantage by
moving to the cloud, or they just look at it and say, all of our competitors are going.
And they just don't want to be left behind. That's one. Two is every conversation
quickly evolves into a cost conversation. And can you guys really do this cheaper
than we can do it? And we still have customers who say, even if it's a cloud oﬀering,
we can run it cheaper ourselves. Then when you get in and show them the numbers
and show them the beneﬁts of scale and the geographic footprint we get and all of
the goodness that comes along with security and everything else that's in our cloud,
then I think they understand that there's a diﬀerent stream just running at low cost
and running at low cost with all the compliance and security and everything else that
goes along with it. And so for us, they want a competitive advantage and they want it
at a lower cost than they're getting today. I would say those are the 2 primary drivers.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
On average, when you're looking at that total cost of ownership and it's less for you
guys to do it, on average, approximately how much less from total cost of ownership
is it typically? And I know it depends on the customer?
Yes. It really depends. But I would say it's almost always double digits lower than
what they could do it.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
Great. And let's talk about -- there are obviously competing cloud vendors in the
marketplace. AWS has got a -- and (Jesse) is talking right now. And we're talking
right now.
Thanks, everybody, for being here.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
Exactly. Then Google Cloud is an up-and-coming vendor in that market. How do you
guys -- when you're out in the ﬁeld, how do you diﬀerentiate from the other cloud
oﬀerings other than just the hybrid cloud approach?
Yes. And I think -- hybrid has been a lead story for us and I think will continue to be a
lead story for us. Price is always a factor when you're out competing in this -- we've
made some public statements that we're going to be a price matcher in. So we'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

Q - Michael Barry Nemeroﬀbasically saying we're not going to lose a deal based on price. And I think that the
global footprint is something that's hard for everybody else to match. We have data
centers all over the world. So for anybody who's doing business outside the U.S.,
that's super important as well.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
And you mentioned that you would match price cuts. But do you think you're better
oﬀ matching those price cuts if not keeping the prices a little bit higher than the
others in the market given the premium services that diﬀerentiate Microsoft?
Well I think it's a combination of both. I mean, one is we just said, hey, we're not
going to get our position on price, which is just that -- we just see that as fair. If
somebody is oﬀering a service and we're oﬀering a service, then we shouldn't be
underpriced. I think Microsoft has always been a company that has focused on share.
And we'll continue to do that. I think we also are getting much better -- to your
earlier question, Michael, about what are we seeing that's diﬀerent, we're getting
much better about explaining the innovation that we're adding to the cloud and
some of the things that we oﬀer. So to us, it's both. It's, hey, we're not going to get
beat on price. But if you pay...
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
On compute.
On compute. But if you pay -- if you're a customer of Microsoft for that price, you will
get all these innovations that we're investing in. And so I think, ultimately, the market
is going to go to being priced base on innovation as opposed to just low cost. And
we -- when we came out and said, hey, we're going to match price, it was more to
save price out of the conversation and to get the conversation back to innovation
and back to the best technology.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
So you feel like the mix shift of your premium services versus compute will oﬀset the
price cuts. That's...
Yes. Premium services is growing faster than core Azure. And we'll expect that to
continue for.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
You mentioned earlier that you see your legacy products as an asset. What's
interesting is the durability of the server products over the last couple of years. How
do you see that continuing to evolve? And do you see that durability continuing in
the server business?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

Page 8 of 18A - David M. O'Hara
Q - Michael Barry Nemeroﬀ
A - David M. O'Hara
Q - Michael Barry NemeroﬀWell yes. I mean -- so I would just say that I -- we'll continue to support those server
products and we'll continue to support those customers running those server
products as long as they ﬁnd them useful and as long as they're getting value from
them. And right now they're getting a lot of value from them. And so we -- it goes
back to the hybrid story of making sure those on-prem products work at the cloud.
And we'll do that. Even Oﬃce, using Oﬃce as an example, the transition to the Oﬃce
365 and the online version has -- we've done well at it. But there's still a lot of room
to grow there, too. And so all of the stuﬀ takes years and years to transition over. And
so I think the important thing for the customers is they made big investments. They
don't want to throw out those investments. They also want the beneﬁts of the cloud.
So they expect us to make all that work together.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
One of the questions I get a lot from investors is your CapEx spending and where
you are in the spending on building out the data center footprint around the world
to support Azure and for how long it could support Azure. It looks like CapEx is
going to be roughly ﬂat this year from last year. Should investors expect that the
large spending on CapEx to build out Azure over the last couple of years that you've
done is not over but kind of leveling oﬀ so that we should start to see an
improvement in the margins on that?
Well I would say, we were getting a lot of questions on cloud margin, I think it was 12,
18 months ago in terms of how we thought about cloud margin. As we explained at
the time. And we've been candid about this, we were playing catch-up. And AWS
had a head start on us. Azure came out later. We had to catch up. Catching up meant
that we had to build out our data center footprint in the U.S. but also around the
globe. We were putting up lots of buildings and investing in a lot of servers and
spending a lot of money on networking. And there is just a cost of catching up. And
I'm not saying we're past that. But I do think we have a much better demand signal
now. We've largely built out our global footprint. So from countries you can go into.
But we're largely built out. And in addition to that, to the earlier comment I made
about where we sat in a room and said we need to really double down on the
engineering piece of it, I think we've driven some really good engineering
improvements over the last couple of years. We have super smart engineers working
on this stuﬀ. And they've gone and done some things in the core code that make it
run more eﬃciently and more cost eﬀectively. And you can get more out of a server
and you can get more out of a data center. And so I think when you look at the
CapEx curve, we -- when it was at a steeper slope, we were playing catch up. And
now as it sort of starts to ﬂatten out, you're just seeing the beneﬁts of scale and good
engineering driving cost eﬃciencies. And so I think we'll continue to see some of the
beneﬁts from the engineering investments that we made. And we'll continue to see
some of the investments from the global expansion that we made.

Q - Michael Barry NemeroﬀOne of the questions I get from investors around % utilization of those data centers,
what is a comfortable % utilization as the CFO of those businesses that you ﬁll with?
Well any engineer would say you can measure utilization 50 diﬀerent ways. And so it
depends on (inaudible)
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
How do you measure? What metrics that you look at?
I would say -- well, I'll give a very CFO answer. I measure it on how our cloud gross
margins are doing, right, which is if a cloud gross margins are improving, you're
getting more return on your assets. And so as long as we continue to drive
improvement in cloud gross margin, I feel like we're getting decent utilization.
Obviously, the engineers go through and look at that. And they look at the
chokepoints within the data centers and say, what's the chokepoint and how do we
expand that. And so we're counting on continued good innovation on the
engineering side to drive better utilization of our data centers.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
You brieﬂy touched on the gross margin of that business. And last quarter was the
ﬁrst time that we saw the actual margin split out for commercial cloud, which implied
was a very healthy gross margin for Azure, probably a lot higher than people
believed. What do you attribute that strength? And where do you see that going
over time?
Well I think it will continue to improve. I would say that I think there's a few things --
just to state the obvious, there's a few things that impact margin. And ﬁrst and
foremost is price. And so how do you think about the price you're able to achieve in
the market, which was, again, part of our goal of sort of neutralizing price
conversation because we do think, ultimately, it's about innovation. I do think we'll
continue to see some engineering beneﬁts. Even though I think the engineering
team has done great work in the last couple of three years, there's still a lot of
opportunity to go out and drive good beneﬁts there. I also think there's some things
that we're doing that will -- so there is always puts and takes. And some of the things
we're doing like building out more availability zones to make sure that customers are
up and running and they don't have any downtime, I think that's an investment we're
willing to make. And that might swing it a little bit the other way. But I would just say,
over time, we'll continue to see good improvement in cloud gross margin.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}

Q - Michael Barry Nemeroﬀnow in the public cloud business. Is there any reason why you couldn't match or
exceed what AWS is doing in their margins in their cloud business?
Yes. We believe -- I always said that when we're at the same scale, when we're at the
same inﬂection point, we should be able to have -- we should be able to achieve the
same gross margins. I think Microsoft is in a unique position because, really, we talk
about the Microsoft cloud. Last quarter, we reported $5 billion in cloud revenue. And
that's -- we're talking about Oﬃce 365. We were talking about Azure. We were
talking about Dynamics. Bing, you can even argue that Bing was the very ﬁrst cloud
service we had. And so when we're building out a data center, we don't build it out
for 1 SKU. We don't build it out for sort of their metal SKU, for lack of a better word.
We're supporting this very diverse cloud. And so I think it's -- there's a little bit of
uniqueness there in terms of how we think about spend and how we think about the
cloud build-out. I also think it puts us in a very unique position relative to
competitors that we have a much broader cloud oﬀering. And so I think over time,
we will see -- it's fair to go in and say, how are those margins doing compared to
others? How is Oﬃce doing compared to others' assets? How is Dynamics doing
compared to others' assets? How is core Azure doing compared to AWS? I think
those are all fair comparisons.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
That's great. That's a great segue into turning to Oﬃce 365, the commercial
opportunity. The Oﬃce 365, the 365 commercial, for the ﬁrst time recently, that
eclipsed the licensing on Oﬃce 365. What inning do you think we're in? And how
large do you think that 365 commercial business could be over the next couple of
years?
Yes. It's sort of interesting because when I was -- when I ﬁrst moved in the Oﬃce
business, I heard a lot of people saying, hey, Oﬃce is dead, ﬂat, it's going to be
done. And we have -- over the course of a few years, we've injected really good
healthy growth back into the Oﬃce business. And so the question is, how high is up?
I just revert back to our strategy, which is our strategy has been use Oﬃce as an
opportunity to both continue to support customers in their Oﬃce environment but
also to break into new markets. If you look at E5, that's helping us break into some
new markets that we wouldn't have been in. Otherwise, we wouldn't have been a big
player. And otherwise, security is a big piece to how we think about that. BI and
analytics, voice, all of those are part of the E5 oﬀering. And so what we did is we -- at
one point in time, in its early days, our E1 SKU, our low-end SKU was the most
predominant SKU. And now we've said that over half of our customers are running
premium SKUs, which is E3 and higher. And so we just look at it as the Oﬃce
playbook is keep oﬀering SKUs, use the Oﬃce strategy to break into new markets
and do it at a very cost-competitive way. So how high is up? It's really dictated by
how innovative can we be? What's E next look like? We have E3 and E5, what's E
next and what are those oﬀerings?

Well I would say, our ARPU has trended up. But that's more -- that has more to do
with the mix. That has more to do with people moving to E3 or people moving to E5.
And so we haven't increased pricing. But we have shifted the mix in the higher-value
SKUs.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
Within E5, what are the -- some of the demand drivers that are pushing that, the
highest price tier? Is it BI? Is it security?
Security is certainly top of mind for lots of people. And we have a really good
security oﬀering through the E5 SKU. And so when we're really talking to folks about
E5, we -- security is a big topic conversation. The BI and the analytics, we have -- the
Power BI stuﬀ is very popular both either of the free version or the paid version.
They're both doing well. And so I think the analytics piece is super important. Then
voice is typically a longer-term sell. If you're in -- trying to get somebody to replace a
PDF system, that's going to be a longer conversation. So I think it's a mix. When we
came out with E5 SKU, folks were asking, how do these things tie together and how
do they accrue value in certain companies that focus in more on one or the other.
Then in the end, when you get done talking to them about it, a lot of them just say,
ﬁne, let's take the E5 SKU. And those are all good oﬀerings that we'll use over time.

I was just out at the Salesforce's Dreamforce Conference. And they had a market
share slide with Microsoft really down low, with Dynamics at the bottom of that slide.
How are you guys thinking about getting some more market share in the Dynamics
business? And what are the drivers there? Is it with through the acquisition of
LinkedIn and the data that that's going to provide? What are some of the things that
you guys are working on to really pour some gas on the ﬁre in the Dynamics
business?
Yes. I think Dynamics -- and Satya would say Dynamics as a company is our biggest
opportunity for growth. And I think it's -- candidly, it's also -- again, very CFO'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

A - David M. O'Haraperspective. But it's the biggest opportunity for good, healthy gross margin. So we
look at the Dynamics business and we say, the history of biz apps has been about
big monolithic applications where people need to come in and pay a lot of money
then pay even more money to get them implemented. And by the time you're done,
you're years into it and tens of millions of dollars. And so we've been on a path to
take that tech and break it down so it's more digestible and it's more disruptive to
the marketplace, which is you don't have to buy these big monolithic apps. You can
go in and buy a set of services and only the set of services that you need or you can
just go in and buy a subset of those services. And we do it in a very cost-eﬀective
way. So what we're trying to tell folks, again, sort of similar to the cloud or similar to
the hybrid story is, hey, you don't need to throw out everything you've invested in.
So we're not in trying to say throw out your European build on our ERP. We're saying
we have some really -- we have a great collection of biz apps services that can be
broken down and you can just take pieces of it at a time. So if you already made a
big investment in some ERP system, we can go in and augment that, we can
surround that. And over time, if they want to throw all that out and go with ours,
great. But it's not required. So I think, for us, the real opportunity Dynamics when you
see that low share is it's all growth, I mean. So it's all upside. If you look at Oﬃce, we
have pretty high share. There's still upside in Oﬃce. But it's a high share oﬀering,
whereas Dynamics, we just feel like it's all upside.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
Closing out on Oﬃce, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about the piracy -- pirated base of
Oﬃce. It's a very heavily pirated software. How does the 365 commercial or the shift
to the cloud help you on that pirated capacity?
Yes. Well obviously, it's really, really hard to pirate an online service. And there's ways
that we can govern that. And so we're building all of our innovation into the online
services, continuing to innovate it on-prem as well. But a lot of the good news is
coming in the online services. So if you want the latest and greatest Oﬃce, you
should be in the online oﬀering, which is hard to pirate. I would just say that our
strategy on Oﬃce is -- ﬁrst of all, we want you as an Oﬃce user. And secondly, we
want you as a paying Oﬃce user. And so if the choice is having them use the pirated
version versus having them use the competitive product, we'd probably take that.
Then over time, we just want to move them to Oﬃce 365 when they're ready to
move there.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
And just lastly, on Oﬃce margins, do you think that you can keep pushing past peak
margins in that business, in the Oﬃce business? And when do you get there with
your scale in the cloud?
Yes, yes. I mean, I feel like the Oﬃce business is a pretty scaled business right now.
There are still beneﬁts of scale that we can achieve with Oﬃce. But if the -- and you
pointed out earlier, over half of our customers are now cloud customers. That's aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

A - David M. O'Harapretty scaled business. I would say an inverse of that or sort of a diﬀerent lens on that
question we get asked is, how do you feel about Oﬃce pricing, because if you really
wanted to drive up margins on Oﬃce, you would look at pricing and say, is there
something we can do on Oﬃce pricing. And we feel -- we're, again, a share
company. We feel like it's important to have as many people using Oﬃce as
possible. And so we're not focused on maximizing price. We're focused on
maximizing value to the customer and maximizing share. And so I think there's
always an opportunity to improve margins in any product, including Oﬃce. So we
feel -- and we'll continue to see improvement in Oﬃce margins. So we feel good
about our strategy. And our strategy is one more of share as opposed to maximizing
price and maximizing margins today. It's more about the long haul.

One of the things that we keep hearing Satya talk about is artiﬁcial intelligence. And
you are in charge of artiﬁcial intelligence at Microsoft. I keep reading about advances
and investments that you guys are making in hardware and quantum computing and
pushing that. How does AI ﬁt into the overall strategy of Microsoft? And where is that
today versus just a couple of years ago?
Yes. Well AI, we made a lot of progress in AI in the last couple of years. I also feel it's
still very nascent. I mean, we -- it's -- the one thing about -- that's unique about the
cloud business, I think, when we're -- and I'll circle around that to your question, I
promise. But the one thing about the cloud business is it's just a high -- it's an
expensive game to be in. And there just can't be that many players of scale. And I
think we're seeing that. And I think we'll see that in artiﬁcial intelligence, too, which is
it's really going to be an expensive business to play. And so I think...
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
How do you mean that?
Well because the investment that you need to make just even in the engineering
side, when -- and the engineering side in AI...
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
On the hardware side?
Well on the software side ﬁrst. And then when you start talking about hardware and
you start talking about things like quantum and some of those other innovative
technologies, I mean, you really got to sort of stare into the investment and say, am I
ready for this? And so there just aren't that many companies that literally can aﬀord
to do it, much less have the fortitude to do it. And so I think the folks who win in AI
will be the ones who are willing to make the big investment and who are willing to
innovate, both on hardware and the software side. And we're making investments inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

A - David M. O'Haraboth those. We're also seeing some companies out of China that are leaning in
heavy on AI. And so I think it will be -- I do think it will be a bit of deep pockets race.
There will be companies, point solutions, that do great work on AI. And it will be cool
and innovative and helpful. But to really get scale in AI, I think you're going to need
some fairly deep pockets. And so early, early days. You asked the question earlier
about what inning are we in Oﬃce. I think in AI, we're absolutely still in the ﬁrst
inning.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
As the CFO, you're the person in charge of making those investments. And you just
said you have to kind of stare into the abyss and get comfortable. But there's going
to be a return on that. How much are you willing to put in, throw in to AI without
knowing what the payback is going to be over the next 3, 4, ﬁve years?
Yes. That's a good question. We ask ourselves that every day. I mean, yesterday, we
were asking ourselves that question. I would just say that we focus on, is there value
to customers? And so we try to take what we're building and what we're working on
and get that in front of a customer as soon as we possibly can and say, does this add
value for you? Would this -- do you see this as helping you run your business? And if
the answer is yes, then ultimately, we feel like there's a monetization model there.
And so we don't need to know the exact SKU or the exact price of that SKU or who's
going to buy it. We just need to know the customers are going to look at it and say,
hey, that's innovative, I want that, that will help me. Then we'll ﬁgure out the
monetization strategy. So I would just say, the short answer is we'll make -- we'll
continue to make investments. We will continue to be a market leader in AI. And
there will be responsible investments that have some forward-looking lens on
monetization.
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
Well how forward is that lens? I mean, I guess that's the question, right? If you are
going to see the return in one year or two years, then yes, probably you're going to
make that investment. But how willing are you to look out 3 to ﬁve years for some of
the -- to see the monetization in the investments that you're making in AI?
Yes. A part of our org is also Microsoft Research. And we have -- we invest a
considerable amount in just pure research every year. And so a lot of the AI work, it's
done in MSR. And then a lot of the AI work, it's done in the engineering groups. And
so if you look at something like MSR, we don't look at that through a monetization
lens per se. We just say, look, there's research that we need to be doing to stay on
the cutting edge. And we're going to continue to do that. As it moves closer to our
product group, we move it closer toward a monetization model. And so we -- I really
look at it and say -- as the CFO, I look at it and say, is that something somebody
would be willing to pay for? And whether that's a year down the road or three years
down the road, I think that matters. But it matters less. It more like are we really
adding value to customers. So we have the pure MSR research piece that is doing aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-29

something that people (inaudible)
{BIO 6355446 <GO>}
Related to AI as well as research, how do you measure success with some of the
investments that you're making, especially if they're long-term investments?
Well we had the -- we go through and do a deep analysis on the return on invested
capital for CapEx, for example. And so that's another big bet where we were
spending, obviously, billions of dollars. And we just say how are we really going to
get a return on this. And so you get -- you have to go through and build the model. I
think that from our perspective, the toughest part about building a long-term model
is just getting a sense of the demand. I mean, do you really have your -- do you really
have a nose for the demand curve and what that demand look like? And in AI, it's
early days. I mean, all we know is everybody is super interested in it. They think it's
cool. They really don't know how it's all going to work. But I think there's enough
there for us to keep investing because people are saying if this really works, we'll pay
for it.

There's been a lot of investment and talk about collaboration tools. And you actually
have the Microsoft Teams, which is a relatively new product competing against Slack,
which, kind of in upstart, kind of went toe-to-toe with you guys publicly. How do you
view the competition in the collaboration space right now?
There's a lot of innovative companies out there. I think that Slack -- Stewart in that
curve had done a really good work. And they were out front on a lot of that, how
they think about collaboration and communication. We have customers that tell us,
hey, we use Slack, we're a Slack shop. But we also use it with Oﬃce 365. So don't be
confused. We love Oﬃce 365, that's just our communication tool. That's a little bit of
what drove us to build the Teams as we decide -- folks using both. And we said, well,
maybe there's an opportunity to just have that all work in one environment. And so I
-- there's a lot of good innovators out there, I think. And lots of interesting stuﬀ on
collab. Some other companies out there are doing really good stuﬀ. Ultimately, we
have a really big base of Oﬃce customers. And we feel like if we can take Team to
that Oﬃce, that base of Oﬃce customers, that's going to give them the collaboration
they need.

Great. So what are -- you're obviously in charge of the Research division, too, which
is the other cutting edge of what Microsoft is working on. What are some of the areas
that are the most exciting things that we'll hear about from Microsoft over the next 1,
2 and three years?
Yes. And we've touched on -- I think we've touched on most of them. I think AI, you'll
see a lot of stuﬀ manifested in AI. And a lot of that started in MSR. And then we'll
eventually segue to the product groups. I think quantum is a really interesting
opportunity. And I sit in lots of quantum meetings. And I'm still not sure I understand
a bit. There are people who do. And I think they're doing really interesting work. And
we'll see where that goes. But not all of those bets are going to pay oﬀ. I think we
just need to make the bets. Then I'll just start back with the very ﬁrst question we
had, which is what's diﬀerent about Microsoft? I feel like we're better at identifying
the bets better serving to get traction and moving resources and dollars to those
bets. So we're not trying to pick the winners right away. We're trying to invest in
various areas. And once we see one of them start to win, then we're better at moving
the resources there and investing.

A - David M. O'Harathat newness. And the partner ecosystem has shown an amazing propensity for
making big bets and big investments. They just -- a lot of them just come to us and
say, tell us which you're working on, we want to get in front of that, we want to build
a new practice. There are some partners who are more focused on taking care of
their existing customers and maybe they're not innovating as much or investing in
the new products as much. But we need to balance that. I mean, we need partner
ecosystems kind of take care of all of our customers on-prem, in the cloud, wherever
they are. And so I feel like -- I'm a big believer in the partner ecosystem. I know a lot
of partners, personally spend time with them. And I think we have a partner network
that's second to none. And we'll continue to have that.

One thing I didn't ask about is Microsoft's security strategy. Very important these
days, how would you characterize it these days at Microsoft?
I would describe it as a very strong business and growing. That -- to the earlier
question about E5, that's probably the biggest demand pull for how we think about
E5. Those are the biggest demand pulls for how we think about Azure, which is
securing compliance in people. That's just table stakes. If you have a cloud service,
you have to have the best security. And you have to have -- there has to be
compliance. And so we focus on those. From the very ﬁrst day, we've been -- that's
been a focus for us. I don't know that security is something that Microsoft has always
been known for. But I think we're getting more known for that, especially as the
cloud oﬀerings continue to grow.
