Thank you, (Tori) It's a pleasure to be here today to talk about GitHub and Microsoft.
And our shared goal to empower developers. I want to share what this acquisition
will mean for our industry and for developers. The era of the Intelligent Cloud and
the Intelligent Edge is upon us. Computing is becoming embedded in the world
with every part of our daily life and work and every aspect of our society andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-04

Page 2 of 6economy being transformed by digital technology. And developers are the builders
of this new era, writing the world's code. As every industry is being impacted by
technology from precision medicine to precision agriculture, from personalized
education to personalized banking, the developer community will only grow in
numbers and importance. Developer workﬂows will drive and inﬂuence business
process and functions across the organization, from marketing to sales to service to
IT and HR. And this is just not happening in the technology sector but in every
industry. According to LinkedIn data, software engineering roles in industries outside
of tech, such as retail, health care and energy are seeing double-digit growth year-
over-year, 25% faster than the growth of developer roles in the tech industry itself. As
every company becomes a digital company, value creation and growth across every
industry will increasingly be determined by the choices developers make.
In short, developers will be at the center of solving the world's most pressing
challenges. However, the real power comes when every developer can create
together, collaborate, share code and build on each other's work. And in all walks of
life, we see the power of communities and this is true for software development and
developers. That's why we're so excited about today's announcement. Building
technology so that others can build more technology is core to our mission to
empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We
don't celebrate technology for technology's sake. We celebrate what others can do
with technology. Also core to our mission is empowering communities from the
world's professionals to IT professionals to gamers. We believe in the power of
communities to achieve more than what their members can do on their own. It's our
ability to work together that helps our dreams become reality. And we are dedicated
to cultivating and growing communities to do just that. More than 28 million
developers already collaborate on GitHub and it's home to more than 85 million
code-repositories used by people in nearly every country. From students to hobbies
to startups to large organizations, GitHub is the destination for developers to learn,
share and work together to create software. And GitHub is the world's leading
software development platform. It's a destination for Microsoft too. As GitHub shared
in a recent report, Microsoft is the most active organization on GitHub with more
than 2 million commits or updates made to projects. And from our earliest days,
we've been a developer-focused company with our very ﬁrst product, the basic
interpreter for the Altair in 1975. Obviously, a lot has happened since then. But we
still focus on creating tools and platforms for this new generation of developers. We
have always loved developers. And we love open-source developers. We've been on
a journey ourselves with open source and the open source community. Today, we
are all in with open source. We are active in the open source ecosystem, we
contribute to open source project. And some of our most vibrant developer tools
and frameworks are open sourced. When it comes to our commitment to open
source, judge us by the actions we have taken in the recent past, our actions today
and in the future. Given all this, together with GitHub, we see 3 clear opportunities
ahead. First, we will empower developers at the -- every stage of their development
life cycle, from ideation, to collaboration, to deployment, to the cloud and to the
edge. Going forward, GitHub will remain an open platform, which any developer can
plug into and extend. Developers will continue to be able to use the programming
languages, tools and operating systems of their choice for their projects. And will still
be able to deploy their code to any cloud and any device. Second, we will accelerateFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-04

Page 3 of 6Chris Wanstrathenterprise developers use of GitHub with our direct sales and partner channels and
access to Microsoft's global cloud infrastructure and services. Finally, we'll bring
Microsoft developer tools and services to new audiences.
To close, I want to share some details of the transaction. Microsoft will acquire
GitHub for $7.5 billion in all stock consideration. Most importantly, we recognize the
responsibility we take on with this agreement. We are committed to being stewards
of the GitHub community, which will retain its developer-ﬁrst ethos, operate
independently and remain an open platform. We will always listen to developer
feedback and invest in both fundamentals as well as new capabilities. Once the
acquisition closes later this year, GitHub will be led by CEO, Nat Friedman, an open
source veteran and founder of Xamarin, who will continue to report to the Microsoft
Cloud and AI Group Executive Vice President, Scott Guthrie. GitHub's CEO and Co-
Founder, Chris Wanstrath, will be a Technical Fellow at Microsoft and reporting to
Scott. Together, we will continue to advance GitHub as a platform loved by
developers and trusted by organizations. And to share more on GitHub, I'll turn it
over to Chris.
{BIO 18716070 <GO>}
Thank you, Satya. I'm super excited about today's news. We started GitHub because
we wanted an easier way to work together on all sorts of projects, whether they were
open source, private or just something in between. And since then we've seen the
rise of smartphones, VR, AR, self-driving cars, all sorts of amazing innovations. And
the thing they all have in common is software. The future is powered by software.
And for 10 years, it's been our mission to make it easier for people to become
software developers and easier for existing developers to build better software
together. Today we've grown to become one of the largest code hosts and
development platforms in the world, with over 28 million developers globally using
GitHub to help build software. Through every step of our growth, we've been
obsessed with building a product for the people using it. Our focus has been the
developer. And our belief has been that making life better for developers would
result in better software and a better life for us all. As we look to the next decade of
software development and beyond, we know it will focus on people, the people
building the software and the people using it. As we've gotten to know the team at
Microsoft over the past few years through partnerships, collaborating on open
source and working together to improve Git, we've learned that they agree. Their
work, in particular, on open source has been inspiring. In record time, they've gone
from dabbling to full on embracing the community, releasing .NET as open source,
developing VS Code in the open and using Git internally are just a few things they've
done that helped us decide Microsoft is the right home and the right future for
GitHub. Their success with Minecraft and LinkedIn acquisitions has also shown us
how serious they are about growing new businesses while maintaining their
independence and identity. And their contributions to developer tooling and the
cloud have showed they are continuing to innovate. But more than all of that, what
stands out to me is Microsoft's vision for the future of software, their focus on
developer-ﬁrst and how these philosophies match our own. We both believe GitHub
needs to remain an open platform for all developers, no matter your language, stack,
platform, cloud, license, device, GitHub will continue to be your home, the best
place for software creation, collaboration and discovery. We both believe thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 6Nat Friedmansoftware development needs to become easier, more accessible, more intelligent
and more open. So more people can become developers and existing developers
can spend more time focusing on the unique problems they're trying to solve. We
both see the growing need for developers and the growing importance of software
in all facets of our life. I think, all of us recognize that. But most importantly, we both
believe that we can do greater things together than alone. Collaboration, after all, is
at the heart of everything GitHub does. And spending time with the team, it's also
become clear that Nat Friedman embodies this ideas and passions to his core. He is
a long-time open source developer and cofounded Xamarin, a pretty awesome
development tool that recently joined Microsoft. In my mind, he is the perfect ﬁt to
take on the role of GitHub's, CEO, upon the close of this deal and help lead us into
the future. I could not be more excited about our future with Nat and Microsoft. Last
year, I announced that I'd be stepping down as GitHub's CEO and remaining
involved as an adviser. And I'm very, very happy to be joining Microsoft in a similar
role and completely conﬁdent in Nat and the team. So with that, let me hand it oﬀ to
Nat.
{BIO 4010928 <GO>}
Thank you, Chris and Satya. I am incredibly excited to be here today. I've been a
developer almost my entire life. I think I wrote my ﬁrst line of code when I was six
years old. So I've been coding since as long as I can remember. And I've been
hooked. And I grew up as a developer. And with the developer mindset, I discovered
Linux and open source in high school in the '90s. And I went deep down that rabbit
hole and I spent about a decade of my career working in open source and Linux.
And in fact, I made my ﬁrst commit on GitHub just a year after it started in 2009. As
Chris said, I joined Microsoft two years ago as a part of the acquisition of my
company Xamarin. And so I know how Chris is feeling right now. I was in a similar
spot to him a couple of years ago embarking on this new chapter and everything
that, that entails. Since joining Microsoft, I've been running our developer services
team. And so the common thread across my career has really been about creating
and engaging with developers across multiple dimensions. And that's why I'm so
excited about today's news. GitHub is, to me, the most important developer-ﬁrst
company in the world. It's a company that has already accomplished so much to
become the largest community in the world and has changed the way developers
collaborate together to build software. And I'm passionate about not just what
GitHub is today. But the potential for what it can be in the future and unlocking that
potential to create new opportunities for developers around the world. Core to this,
is the idea that GitHub is the developer's home. And what I mean by that is, it is the
place developers go to be a developer, to discover, to create, to learn. And
collaborate and communicate with each other. And as I think about our path forward
and this idea of the developers' home, there are 2 critical aspects that underpin that
road ahead. The ﬁrst, as Satya said and as Chris mentioned, is our commitment to
openness. GitHub was founded as an open platform, as a free marketplace where
anyone could upload their code and anyone could extend the platform, Open APIs,
an open community and an open platform. And we continue that commitment. The
second is the potential for an even more expanded set of opportunities. We want to
bring more developers and more capabilities to GitHub because, as a network and
as a group of people and a community, GitHub is stronger the bigger it is. Lastly, anFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 6Amy E. Hoodimportant part to all of this is, as Satya said, GitHub will operate independently. I
think it's important to reiterate that here.
So next, let me share with you a few examples of how we see all this potential
coming to life and give you a taste for what's possible together with GitHub and
Microsoft. And the ﬁrst is centered on the cloud, The cloud is increasingly a core
priority for developers. And since at GitHub everything we do should be about
making a developer's life better at every stage of their work and life cycle, that
includes helping them make it easier to build on the cloud. As part of this, we think
broadly about the new and compelling types of ways that we can integrate cloud
services into GitHub. And this doesn't just apply to our cloud. GitHub is an open
platform. So we have the ability for anyone to plug their cloud services into GitHub
and make it easier for you to go from code to cloud. And it extends beyond the
cloud as well, from code to cloud, code to mobile, code to edge device, code to IoT,
every workﬂow that a developer wants to pursue, we will support. A second example
to illustrate how we'll do this is the GitHub marketplace. Today, GitHub oﬀers a
marketplace that any organization or even any individual developer can use to
integrate their developer tools and services. And GitHub is as healthy as the network
and marketplace that it has. This is a great way for developer tools and services to
reach developers. Now when it comes to Microsoft, as we're acquiring GitHub, we
have the opportunity to go all in on the GitHub marketplace.
And so we will be oﬀering all Microsoft developer tools and services in the GitHub
marketplace. The last illustration that we want to share has to do with VS Code. Chris
already mentioned that VS Code is a development environment and editor that
Microsoft released fairly recently. And we were honored last year to be chosen by
developers on stack overﬂow as the most popular development environment. We
have almost 5 million developers a month who use VS code. It, itself, is open source
and developed in the open on GitHub. Now with the acquisition of GitHub, we can
integrate new capabilities into VS Code to create a more seamless experience for
developers so that they can collaborate and merge code and just have a more
productive experience from end-to-end.
So in summary, our vision is really all about empowering developers and creating a
home where you can use any language, any operating system, any cloud, any device
for every developer, whether you're a student, a hobbyist, a large company, a startup
or anything in between, GitHub is the home for all developers. Now let me pass it to
Amy to run through the ﬁnancial aspects of the deal.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thanks, Nat. Over the past four years, you've seen our consistent approach to
mergers and acquisitions of all sizes. We focus on structurally growing markets,
aligned to our strategic priorities, where we can add unique value to the users or the
community. And at a price that supports the long-term shareholder value creation.
GitHub certainly meets those criteria. We have agreed to acquire GitHub for $7.5
billion in Microsoft stock. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the
Boards of Directors of both Microsoft and GitHub. We will ﬁnance this transaction
through all stock consideration. We expect that an incremental share buyback,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 6Operatorbeyond our recent historical quarterly pace, will oﬀset stock consideration paid
within six months after closing. We will utilize the portion of the approximately $30
billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization for the purchase.
Based on the expected close date and Microsoft's ﬁscal '19 and '20, we anticipate
this transaction will be minimally dilutive, less than 1% to EPS on a non-GAAP basis.
And in FY '20, we expect the transaction to be accretive to operating income on a
non-GAAP basis. In this context, non-GAAP excludes the expected impact of
purchase accounting adjustments as well as the integration and transaction-related
expenses. Following the close of the transaction, we expect to report results for
GitHub in our Intelligent Cloud segment.
Finally, our regulatory approach. As you can see on the slide, we plan to obtain
regulatory approval in the United States and the European Union before we close
the transaction. We're conﬁdent about our prospects for obtaining regulatory
approval by the end of this calendar year.
And with that, thank you all for joining Satya, Chris, Nat and me on this exciting
morning.
