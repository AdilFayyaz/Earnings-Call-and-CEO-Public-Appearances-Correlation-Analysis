MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
[Abrupt Start]
...Food and Discount Store Analyst at BofA Merrill Lynch. We're very pleased to have
Greg Foran, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. with us here today. Greg has been
with Walmart since 2011, working in many diﬀerent roles in Walmart International,
including President and CEO of Walmart International. Prior to Walmart, Greg held a
number of positions at Woolworths, one of the large retailer in Australia and New
Zealand.
He has been extremely busy, as some of you probably know, with strategy and
performance at Walmart U.S. over the last few years. So this is a real, real treat that he
made time to be here for us, so we really appreciate it. I also want to thank Michael
Dastugue, who is here with us as well. He is Walmart U.S. CFO. And Kary Brunner is
right there, and he made the trip also. So again real pleased that these guys are
here.
I'm going to turn it over to Greg for some comments before we do Q&A.

And thank you, Robby, for the introduction. Any excuse to get out from ﬁlling the
shelves. Greg Foran, look after the Walmart U.S. stores business. And before I get
into Q&A, I'll just take a few minutes and just give you an update on how things are
going with the business. But ﬁrst, we've got to show you the legal disclaimer. So as a
reminder, we may make forward-looking statements during the presentation this
morning. So please review our entire Safe Harbor statement on our website.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-14

Page 2 of 15So to the business, strong momentum in the stores in FY 2018 as you can see from
the headline. And, look, I'm pleased with how the business in the stores has been
going. We've got a strong – reasonably strong year of comp sales. And the good
thing about it is that it's healthy. That was led by really good traﬃc increases. And in
fact, in Q4, our two-year comp stack was 4.4%. And, Michael, I think that's the best
it's been in about eight years. So we're feeling pretty good about some of the
momentum that we're seeing there.
I'm really pleased with, as I said, the health of that and, in particular, inventories
being a bit of a highlight and a focus for us in the U.S. stores business. We continue
to bring the comp store inventory down and we've done that for 11 consecutive
quarters. There's still room there for us to do more. And the importance of that is that
it breathes life into the store.
If any of you have ever worked in the shops, it is really tough turning out to work,
knowing that your backroom is completely ﬁlled and maybe there is 30 or 40
shipping containers out at the back full of merchandise. I can now turn up to stores
and by and large I can see no shipping containers out at the back of stores apart
from when we're running layaway.
And in most stores, the backrooms now have empty steel. And at the same time that
we're bringing the inventory down, actually the on-shelf customer availability, now
in-stock for customers is actually improving. And that's not surprising, I've seen that
play out in other businesses and it's because, eﬀectively, it's just a healthier way to
run your business.
Technology is helping us get there. A lot of investment from Mark Ibbotson and his
team around developing the right technology and then we layer in the academy
training, so that our associates actually are able to perform their task easier. There's
about 14 to 15 apps that they have on TC70s or, if you like, some of us, we have these
downloaded on our phones. I can check in-stock, I can check availability, I can check
things like what associate turnover is on CAP 2 teams. I can check customer service
scores, clean, fast, friendly. I see customer recommendations or complaints. All of
that is available digitally to all associates in our stores. So good year, good progress,
some momentum and good momentum coming into this year.
Our plan to win, our strategy hasn't changed. But I'll just give you a bit of an update
on a few things. We've been executing against this consistently now over the last
three years and customers are responding to it. And, as you can see, running great
stores, providing convenience, being great merchants, delivering value. What is
changing is that we're changing our mindset around this. For the last three years,
we've been focused on ﬁxing. And I think that's been appropriate. Fixing things like
in-stock, ﬁxing the quality on leafy greens, ﬁxing the associate experience, now we're
moving to a mindset of leading.
And let me touch on how we're doing that across each objective. So, ﬁrstly, running
great stores. Lots of progress we've made, and you've heard me already mentionFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-14
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 15things like clean, fast, friendly. We've seen improvements in that week on week,
month on month. We continue to be focused around driving our grocery business,
that is core to our strategy and included in that, fresh foods. And we're seeing the
customers responding to what we're doing there.
So whether it's developing a much better croissant, which is just sitting in our shelves
now, or whether it's improving the quality of our frozen foods, we're seeing
customers responding to that. But we also see signiﬁcant opportunity in omni-
channel.
And our view here is that customers should be able to shop when they want, where
they want and how they want. And I am completely ambivalent as to whether they
want to drive to our supercenter or neighborhood market, park their car and go in
and do the shopping themselves or whether from the convenience of their home or
maybe they're at work, pull out their mobile device, order what they want online and
then come and pick it up, or as you've heard us say today, at their convenience,
order online and we'll deliver it to them. I'm ambivalent as to how they want to do
that. And I'm excited about the opportunity that that presents. I'll talk some more
about that in a minute.
But we're also in the game of taking friction out wherever we can. And the way I
think about that is, I look at customers' experiences, customer journeys in our store
and whether they're coming in to return a product that they bought, get a refund,
whether they're trying to order a birthday cake, whether they're trying to get their car
checked in to get the oil changed, whether they're trying to get a script reﬁlled,
whether it's checking out and using Scan & Go. I think there's an enormous
opportunity for us to double down in this area and take friction out for the customer.
So that's a key part of the omni-channel experience as well.
In terms of our grocery pickup, another key part of it, we've shared with you the fact
that we rolled out basically 1,100 locations over the last 18 months. And we've gained
momentum through here. We'll do another 1,000 this year, actually just over 1,000.
And that's a pretty rapid pace. And I'm really pleased with the way that the team are
doing that. We're doing it once. We're doing it right. The customers like it. Our NPS
scores for what we're doing with online grocery is incredibly high. At the same time,
these pickup towers – and some of you will have seen these and getting rolled out at
an increasing rate – I think we're up to circa around about 118 of these at the
moment. And you're going to see several hundred of these hit our key stores. The
wait time for getting a parcel out of one of those towers is about 15 seconds. So, you
can imagine the customer experience is pretty good.
And then, of course, today, we've said we need to get into the business of delivering
products if customers want them to their homes. That hasn't been something that
has just cropped up on our screen. We've been quite deliberate about how we have
approached this. First and foremost, you have to ﬁx the basics in the store. Secondly,
develop the skills to be able to pick items from the store and make them available
for pickup.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-14
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 15Third thing, as you develop that muscle, work out how you can deliver those to
customers. And I think it plays well into this concept that here we are a business
spread pretty much across all of America, majority of our stores within 10 miles of
where most people live and within those stores, 100,000 of the bestselling SKUs. So,
theoretically, if we've done our job properly, we got them into the store at ideally the
most eﬀective cost of anyone in America. Now if you want to come go shopping, you
can do that. If you want to pick them up, you can do it. And if you want it delivered,
we'll provide that as well.
Next part of our strategy, great merchants. Isn't this a key part of being a retailer?
And you often hear people talk about assortments. But actually, I get much more
excited talking about items. And I do that because customers buy items. We've done
something recently, which has just been incredible. We've taken our VPI, Volume
Producing Item, and some of you who know the story of Walmart will know the story
of the Moon Pie and we've invigorated this. We now have a VPI app for our
associates.
I go into stores now and associates are pulling out their devices, their phones or
their TC70s and showing me their ranking on where they are, on the item that they
pick, how much margin they're making, how much they're selling. But as well as that,
Steve and the team have been leaning into both national brands and private brands.
And the great thing about Walmart is, we can do both, because we've got big boxes.
And we can do a great selection of national brands and we've been working hard to
get some new ones added into the stable and you can see them down there,
whether it's Bose or Cuisinart. And then, of course, the opportunity to do a great job
with private brands, but not just in food, we've leaned into that over the last three
years but now as we move from ﬁx into leading, let's get really good at general
merchandise.
And I can tell you that apparel, when Walmart does that well, is powerful. You can go
into our stores and you can buy a women's cami, comes in eight colors for $1.68. And
we make pretty good margin on that item. Why? Because we actually buy about 60
million units. So, there is competitive advantage in general merchandise, just as
there is in food when we execute it well.
Finally, delivering value. Our mission hasn't changed and nor should it, save people
money so they can live better. And I can tell you, as I get around the country and I
learn more and more about the U.S., what a fantastic mission for Walmart to have.
There's a lot of people out there, where we operate stores that rely on us to do this
every single day so they can live well. And I'm proud of the fact that what we
continue to do is to provide better value. At the same time we lift quality, we drop
our prices.
Academies is being a key part of our strategy. And you can see a picture there and
you can pull out your phones at any stage and Google if you like, WalmartFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-14
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 15academies and you can see pictures of associates who have graduated from
academies.
What are academies? We've rolled out 200 in the last year. They're located
strategically so any associate in our stores can get to them within a couple of hours
of where their store is. And there we provide proper training in how to use all the
technology that we're creating in the business, whether you're doing section work
and you're changing on hands, whether you're placing manual orders because you
want to drive your VPI.
People are being trained in new skills or it could be you've moved from being a
department manager to now being a personal shopper in online grocery, you've got
to train your associates. So this year we will put through 140,000 associates on top of
the 250,000 we did last year. This is a meaningful diﬀerence to our business.
We continue to think about what else we can do. We had an opportunity at the end
of last year with the changes to tax rates to think about how we might accelerate
some things. And I can share with you that there were three things that we were very
thoughtful about doing. One of them, not surprisingly, was to say, why don't we put
a little bit more into our associates. What we're seeing is, as we invest in our
associates, we get a return on that. We get better productivity. It helps us leverage.
In fact, Michael, we've basically leveraged all four quarters last year in the stores. So
despite the fact we're investing, as we improve productivity, we reduce turnover, we
improve ﬁll rates, pick rates, we're actually able to leverage in this business and at
the same time drop prices. So we invested more in our associates. We took some
action on start rates, but I think even more importantly and I hear this from our
associates, we did a better job with beneﬁts.
Second area, we're encouraged by what we're learning as we continue to oﬀer even
better value to our customers by dropping prices. So we've invested a bit more,
Michael, into pricing, very thoughtful, very strategic about how we do that.
And then the third area, which I'm really excited about, is that we've bought forward
some more investment in IT because we know this is a critical enabler at us driving
even better productivity in our stores. So excited about what we're seeing here as we
continue to work to drive the productivity loop.
So quickly in closing, I'll close where I began. Store business is strong and we've got
pretty good momentum. Our strategy remains the same and we execute against that
very focused and very diligently. The change is that we're now moving from a ﬁxing
mindset to a leading mindset. Let's not play defense, let's get out there and play
oﬀense. We're going to continue to push down the journey of driving even greater
value to our customers. And we're excited about the year ahead. Good momentum.
Roby, back to you. Happy to take your questions.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-14

A - Gregory S. ForanQ&A
Absolutely, great. Thanks for those comments. I think the ﬁrst question that I think
everybody always wants to know from Walmart, so, you mentioned the acceleration
in your momentum and obviously all these things you're doing are working. But, is
there an aspect that's also your core customer feeling better and can you tell us if
you're feeling any change or seeing any change in spending habits that imply sort of
any momentum related to rising wages or a better economy or better conﬁdence et
cetera?
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Yeah. We felt the customer was in pretty good shape last year and we felt that
certainly played out Q3, Q4. And we're not seeing too many changes at the moment,
Michael. And when we look at the broad sort of indicators, whether it's employment
or whether it's the price of gas, we think that's all pretty good. I can tell you, as I get
around the stores and as we pay out Myshare payments to customers, which – to
associates, which we've just done this week, my sense is that everyone is feeling
much like they did last year and for our customer in reasonable shape. Anything you
like to add?
{BIO 6969980 <GO>}
Yeah. I think with the employment, with a little extra money from the tax checks, I
think we're reasonably upbeat about FY 2019.
There hasn't been a whole lot of inﬂation in your same-store sales for the last couple
of years. How should we think about puts and takes for seeing or not seeing some
inﬂation come back into your comps?
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
I'm actually really proud of the fact that we don't have any inﬂation, to be honest with
you. I think it plays well to the story that we're seeing with comp sales. And I like what
I'm seeing in terms of units in the business. And most importantly it plays to saving
people money so they can live better.
So last year, you're right, pretty much no inﬂation. I'm not going to forecast what I
think it's going to be because I don't really know. I hear chatter around the corridors
from the merchants that they're saying they can feel it coming. I can tell you that our
attitude is we're going to continue to invest in price thoughtfully as we have been
doing, that's sort of where it sits.
Can you speak about the role that the stores are playing in the omni-channel
strategy? What is your big focus at the store level that supports the Walmart.com
business and...
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-14
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 15A - Gregory S. Foran
A - Michael DastugueYeah.
...what are the most important initiatives this year?
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Yeah. As I shared in the presentation, I think this is really starting to leverage some of
the assets that we've got. So just to replay quickly what I said, 4,700 stores, roughly
4,000 of those are supercenters. A supercenter has circa 100,000 SKUs. At a point in
time over a period of a year, they have about 270,000 SKUs. What's the diﬀerence?
You put Christmas in, you take it out, you put Easter in, you got deletions, new lines,
but fundamentally, here you are on the corner of Central and Main. In most parts of
rural America and you got a good box that we're remodeling, we're doing 500 good
remodels a year and you got the best 100,000 SKUs you want in your life, 10 miles
from where you live.
I bought them in a truckload, moved them in a truckload and got them on the shelf
in a case. The economics for that have got to be good. So, why don't we now, as
we've improved the running of the store, and the in-stock's improved, and I can have
better conﬁdence on the accuracy of the PI, let's enable a customer to get access to
those from their home. And as I said, a lot of people are still going to drive to the
store and do their shopping. But I guess, increasingly, what you're going to see is
some people are going to say, let's order it and have it available for pickup.
And if we can get really good at this pickup – so it's quick. And by quick I mean, we
see you coming along the road – and we do this now, by the way, about 85% of our
customers who use online grocery, use the check-in app. So we see you coming
along the road, we stage the order, you pull in to the store, we burst out through the
doors. You pop your trunk, we put the groceries in your car, high-ﬁve, particularly for
a man with busy children, and oﬀ they go.
And, of course, today we've said let's get to 800-odd stores this year with delivery.
Now, our view of delivery, that last mile costs you. If I go and oﬀer free delivery for
that last mile, you don't have to be – you can work out, I've got to pay for that
somewhere. So that's why we're going to charge $9.95. We're going to give you
Walmart's everyday low prices, and if you want it delivered, there'll be a fee
associated with it. I guess, as we get more eﬃcient at that, we can probably bring
that fee down. But I'm excited about the fact that we've got the set of assets that
we've got to a point now where we can really leverage them.
Can you give us – can we – actually give us some more metrics on grocery pickup in
terms of, I think, you say you're doing 1,000 more this year, any idea of what happens
to it? Can you give us some idea like when you add one of these, what kind of lift
does it do overall to the stores? How important is it as a contributor to the overall
Walmart.com business?
{BIO 6969980 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-14
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 15A - Gregory S. Foran
A - Michael DastugueLet me start and Greg jump in. I think what we clearly see is that when we add this to
our store, both the customers that use online grocery and those customers that don't
both beneﬁt from the store because, frankly, the store has to up its game and has to
be better in stock. The Net Promoter Scores are terriﬁc, some of our best in the
company. We don't really get into the granularity of talking about lift, but let's just
say it's a meaningful part of our overall eCommerce business and we're excited. And
I think that you're going to continue to see us invest in it in a big way over the next
several years.
And maybe a follow-up on that. Greg, can you talk about how the vendors have
been responding to the omni-channel strategy versus the old way of doing business
and how supportive are they in what Walmart's doing?
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Yeah. Look, we made some pretty signiﬁcant changes, didn't we, about three-and-a-
half years ago as we pulled together, what we called, our legacy plan for the
business. And we committed ourselves back to everyday low price. We reduced the
amount of tabs that we were running. We became disciplined around how we build
modular. We have hit it down a path of shelf-ready trays, with being quite thoughtful
about the role of private label national brand. We have pulled down inventory.
And to be completely transparent, I think a lot of people, probably, said not to show
how this is going to play out, particularly initially if my order volume comes under
pressure. Actually how it's playing out at the moment is pretty good because sales
are up, units are up, way easier to deal with, way more eﬃcient to deal with.
I look for a balance in anything that we do with our suppliers. I think suppliers are a
key stakeholder in our business just as you are, just as customers are, associates are,
and the community is. So getting that balance of the relationship is right. Too easy,
you leave money on the table. Too hard, it comes back and gets you.
So Michael, Steve Bratspies and myself spend a lot of time actually going, if we got
this balance about right, are we being transparent, are we being clear on what we're
doing, are we delivering on what we said we'll be doing? I think we are riding this
one pretty well at the moment. And I spent a lot of time with suppliers at the
Housewares Show in Chicago last Saturday and Sunday, meeting lots of suppliers.
My sense is we're about where we need to be and we got to keep it going.
{BIO 6969980 <GO>}
The only thing I would add is in addition to Steve Bratspies, who leads the
merchandise eﬀort and Greg, also Greg Smith who leads our Supply Chain team, he
came in a little over a year ago and he's doing a terriﬁc job. He actually has
experiences previously with some of our vendors. And supply chain, we got to
remember, it's an important part of that cost structure and some of it's just in
eﬃciencies, right. And it's just better communication between Walmart and the
vendor community. So, we think there's some real opportunities to continue to help
us invest and price there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-14
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 15A - Gregory S. Foran
A - Gregory S. ForanAnother thing I want to ask you about was ship-from-store. One of your competitors
is very big in ship-from-store and that's not a big aspect right now of what you guys
are doing. Can you walk us through the pluses and minuses of ship-from-store from
the Walmart point of view?
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Gee, hasn't the world changed? Online grocery, you could argue is now going to be
ship-from-store. And, of course, we do pickup in every store in general merchandise,
but online grocery pickup in 2,000 stores by the end of the year, so the complexities
of all this play itself out.
We then have another 80-odd stores that we actually use deliberately to ship-from-
store to customers to help oﬀset what we're doing in our FCs. I think what we're
seeing, Michael, and if Marc Lore was sitting here, he would jump into this
conversation as well. What we're seeing is not every item is the same.
And if I had to sum it up, it would be generally lower average unit retail, lower GP
items. It's quite eﬃcient to actually handle those from the store, because you've
bought in a truckload, moved in a truckload, moved in a case. It's quite hard to do
those out of a fulﬁllment center, when they're lower AUR, low GP. Higher AUR, higher
GP items, of course, behave diﬀerently. So if you're buying a set of crystal wine
glasses and they come in a box of eight and it's $80 and you've made 40 points of
margin on it. That's a diﬀerent economic and I probably have got issues about
holding inventory across 4,700 stores on that SKU, in terms of ready to sell. So what
I'm saying play out here depends on what you see. So I think ship-from-store has a
real role in our business, and we're going to use that. In the same way, I think
fulﬁllment team as (27:39) Michael have a real role in that business, so we're going to
use that, and that should be the beauty of the Walmart experience.
Can you talk about some of the things you've done at the stores to sort of convert
them to Walmart online shoppers and is there new initiatives in 2018 you can share
with us?
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Yeah. Such an important thing for us to do, I think we've shared with everyone here
before that those customers that shops in-store and online spends about double.
And we see that as being a real sweet spot in our business. So, getting people to
engage with us both physically and digitally, getting that app downloaded, we're
looking at all kinds of things and stores at the moment, we've got about 92 stores at
the moment, where you can use your phone to go around and do your shopping or
we'll give you a device if you don't want to use your phone. Go through, scan the
items, get them in the bag, get up, you go through a slightly diﬀerent point-of-sale
terminal at the front-end, bank transactions completed, you're not having to go
through a checkout or even a self-checkout.
Apps around how you reﬁll your script, how you skip the queue in ﬁnancial services,
we're continuing to delve and move as quickly as we can in all of these things, soFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-14

A - Gregory S. Foranthat the whole friction of the experience goes away for the customer.
I just want to pause for a second to just see if there were any questions in the
audience. And while we're moving over to here, can you – Greg, can you mention to
us anything in terms of relative category momentum? Are there any categories – I
think, you mentioned apparel...
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Yeah.
...in your overall remarks. Any insights you can give us on what categories could be
up-ticking right now?
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Well, I am pleased about what we're doing in apparel that we've just put four brands
out there, Wonder Nation, Time and Tru, George, Terra & Sky, that's being about
getting the quality up, improving the price ladders, what do I mean by that? You
could go into our stores and you could buy a T-shirt, might be the cami at $1.68, we
might say that's our good, our better might be $2.28 and our best might be $2.74.
And we've been working with the merchants and saying come on let's improve that
ladder.
When you're talking about good, better, best, let's make the best 280 grams, let's
put in the side vents, let's do triple-stitching, let's do some embellishment on the
product and maybe we can sell it for $5.38. So that whole concept of improving the
assortment, the items for the customers is playing out in apparel.
One of the reasons I like apparel is you stayed in (30:55) our stores and you just
have a look at our apparel and you just go, wow, the value of that is incredible and
it's instant gratiﬁcation for a customer. So if we can ensure that we are really
disciplined around being in-stock by size, by color and it's the right item, what
happens when we turn that on for an item that could be shipped to a customer
signed (31:22) from the store? We think that's a real opportunity for us. So, I like
apparel.
We still have so much to do in fresh foods. I got into our stores, we've improved. The
in-stock position has improved, leafy greens have improved, quality of bakery is
improving, but we're not where we need to be. We've got about 250 stores out
there now, where we're doing fresh convenience meals. Now I want that in pretty
much every store over the next couple of years, but it's a hard category to get into
and initially the markdowns are going to be tough. But should Walmart sell great
quality, great value fresh convenient meals? Of course, they should. So, so much
opportunity still in the fresh, so much opportunity in apparel and I could go through
entertainment. Should we be much better at selling mobile phones? You bet. So
we've got work underway in that category at the moment, so a lot's happening.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-14

Page 11 of 15A - Gregory S. Foran
A - Gregory S. ForanI think you started to address this when you were talking about the mobile checkout,
I guess, I wanted to drill a little bit more into that, because that's the worst.
Everything you've done is great, but still when you go to checkout, there was nobody
there to check you out and half of the little self-serve things don't work. That's always
the worst part of the Walmart experience in my mind. So I was going to ask you,
when are we going to get mobile checkout or what else are you doing to improve
that part of the experience?
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Yeah. So, so, look, unashamedly, we've got to change our front-end, that's what we
call it our front-end. So we have leaned heavily into what we call front-end
transformation in our business, we have a project on it. We're on to front-end
transformation three. We've doubled the usage of self-checkout in our stores. And
by the way, that bifurcates customers. There are some customers who will tell me that
absolutely loves self-checkout, there's others who object to it. So, this is a journey.
But you can sort of see where this is going to play out. And where it's going to play
out is where you're not going to have checkouts. And I don't think anyone's really
solved this yet. I'm sure a lot of you've read of what competitors have done in terms
of scales on shelf and various cameras. That's ﬁne, but it's got to be scalable and it's
probably not in its current form. We're working on that. But where you're going to
get to, I think, probably in about ﬁve years is a situation where we have taken as
much friction out of this thing as we can.
We got about 90-odd stores at the moment, as I mentioned, where you can use your
phone or you can use a device that we give you to checkout. I think we'll get that
working quite well over the next few months and you'll see us roll that out even into
more stores. I think there'll be a solution beyond that and we're looking at that at this
stage. And we've got trials underway with that. It will be a journey.
Yeah. In regards to grocery pickup at the store, I have two questions. One is you
indicated the basket is much bigger, but I'm interested in what happens to that
impulse item when the customer's not going into the store. And so, how do you deal
with that issue? And then you indicated you're indiﬀerent between where a customer
shops, but in a pickup, you do have extra labor in picking the items. And so I'm
curious how you think about that in the sort of the economic model.
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Maybe I'll deal with the impulse and you deal with economics. The impulse, there's
no doubt that an impulse bar is there for a reason when you go through a checkout.
And for any of us who've had young children, we know the delights of that. And it
serves its purpose well. And when you're in a business of going sales per square
foot, I like impulse bars.
How do you deal with that online? I'll tell you how we're dealing with it. If you go on
to our orange online grocery app, you will see that as we get into events, whether it's
Valentine's Day, whether it's Mother's Day, whether it's Easter, which is what'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-14

A - Gregory S. Foranhappening at the moment, we are expanding the assortment that's available to the
customer. And it's working for us. I wouldn't go as far as saying that it solves the
entire problem.
But the good thing is it solves a part of it and we are learning and we're continuing
to see what we can do. But there's no doubt in my mind that part of the beauty of
the store is that you buy things that you weren't necessarily thinking about buying.
And that's one of the things I love about pickup, is that not every customer who does
a pickup order simply comes in and picks up. Some do, a reasonable amount of
them actually go and park their car, go into the store and get a few items, go out, use
the Pickup Check-In app and then drive around this pickup lane and pick the other
things up. So we're part way to answering it. We're not all the way there.
{BIO 6969980 <GO>}
Yeah. I think from an economics perspective, I can understand your perspective and
as a kind of a ﬁnance geek, yeah, if I can have the customer do all the work, that's
great. But I think, let's be honest, we're in a world where the customer today wants it
better, faster, cheaper and easier. And I think that what we're seeing is when we can
get a customer to try online grocery and have a great experience, we're getting
more share of wallet. We're seeing an improvement in the store performance, but
there is some additional cost to it and we have to ﬁgure that out. But we're optimistic
that as we – if this is the highest NPS that we have within our box, then there's
something there that we've got to ﬁgure out how we're going to leverage it.
Great. Greg, could you talk to us about the eCommerce business for a few minutes?
Maybe talk about why you believe the business slowed sequentially from Q3 to Q4
last year and why you believe it will reaccelerate back to the 40% growth rate that
you were seeing. And also if you can maybe just touch on why, on the call, I think
Doug mentioned that at Q1 you may not hit that level. So why will it get better as the
year goes on?
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
So a couple of things. Obviously, if Marc was here, he would answer the question,
but he's not so, you're going to direct it to my area. Number one, we made a
deliberate decision not to go quite as heavily into that period as what we could have.
So you think about Black Friday and you think about that leading to Christmas, we
could have put our foot to the ﬂoor, we made a thoughtful decision not to push as
hard in that period.
We're working through building the muscle and it's one of the reasons that we
pulled back. So getting items mirrored (38:55), getting associates trained to pick
faster, getting deliveries either to home or the store, operating more eﬀectively, we
need to continue to build and work on that muscle and we use that period
deliberately to do that.
And the third piece of that is that, of course, we were overlapping some acquisitions
that we did last year. So, we weren't all that surprised by the number, that was a
deliberate decision by us, we sat down and we said, hey, let's, number one, not blowFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-14

muscle; number three, you've got some acquisitions.
Having gone through that period, we're now looking to increase the momentum
again and that's exactly what we're doing. Now, do you turn these things on and oﬀ
overnight? You don't. You build into it. And that's why Doug or Brett would have
made the comment. Yeah. We know where we have guided you to for the year, that's
what we're going for. All things are going to play out equally on each quarter and it
will be where it will be for that ﬁrst quarter. Anything, do you want to add?
{BIO 6969980 <GO>}
(40:20) conﬁdence is still high heading – yeah.
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Yeah.
Greg. You mentioned inventory in your presentation and I think one of the things
that we've heard across especially consumer package goods vendors is sort of
surprise at the inventory reductions towards the end of the year. So, I guess, two
questions, one, is there more – is there room to actually take inventory down more?
And the second is what we've observed from a lot of companies is they may not
have the capabilities to run your inventories that lean. So if you can think of – if you
could just address that as well.
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Sure. First part of the question, yes, there's more. What are we trying to achieve
here? Fundamentally, one touch, I need the product to arrive either in the
distribution center and then from the distribution to the – send it to the store. And I
don't need to be handling, I can't more than once. We've all done the studies of
what it costs every time I pick up a carton of Tide and I move it from here, put it on
the end cap and then stick it out the back and move it from the back and put it on a
side stack, and from the side stack, it ﬁnally ends up on the shelf.
I don't have the labor for that. I don't have the energy. I don't have the associate
engagement to want to do that task. I need that truck to arrive at the DC. I need that
product to ﬂow through that DC and I need it to arrive at the back door of the store
just in time. I'm not out of stock, I've fulﬁlled all my online grocery orders, I've dealt
with ship-from-store and I'm in stock for the customer and I put it on the shelf. There
is more to do. How do I know that? Because when I walk into a store, I still see either
too much product out at the back or I see too much product sitting on the top stock.
And when I walk a DC, we've made improvements here, but I still see too much
there. That's why things like on-time and ﬁll is important to us. Getting it early is
actually just as bad as getting it late. Now, this is a muscle that everyone has to build
into. I can tell you when I ﬁrst spoke to the team in the U.S. and I said, we're going to
take several billion out of our inventory, they looked at us, Michael, and they said, noFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-14

A - Gregory S. Foranway, this is not happening. You have no idea what you're going to do to the
business.
Actually what happened is the in-stock rate went up, accidents have gone down,
cash ﬂows better, all those things. So you got to build a muscle and you got to
believe in us. And the same way that we've had to teach our associates that whether
you're in a store or whether you're in replenishment, I think we've got to do – the
case was – that case was some of our suppliers.
Most suppliers I talked to are actually enthusiastic about the direction we're going.
Starting to be more concise about what the items are that we're doing, being more
deliberate about the assortment, honing in on when we want orders being placed,
when we want them delivered. The good ones are a hit of the wave. Some of them
are surﬁng it and some of them missed it. We just got to keep at it. It is critical that
we get this right. So really, really passionate about that.
What was the second part of your question, sorry?
It's been – I think you answered it. Just in terms of some (43:42).
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Yeah. Yeah, we got a help and technology can help us on some of these areas, can't
it? And I'm just thrilled with some of the work that I'm seeing getting done in our
team. So GRS is now being rolled out. We've changed the replenishment function
under Scott Pleiman. We've got a signiﬁcant project now working with ﬂow because
imports are going to be really important to us because they're part and – important
part of the margin mix to be honest with you. So we're going to work out how we're
going to ﬂow this product. And if we're buying it from Vietnam or Thailand or China,
all of that's got to come together.
Thanks.
And unfortunately, we are overtime. We can probably sit here all day. Greg and
Michael, thank you so much for being here today. We really appreciate it.
