Good morning, Walmart. I cannot tell you how excited I am to be here. Yes. To
welcome all of you to this year's shareholders' and associates' celebration.
So associates, we've always said that our humanity is what sets Walmart apart. So
each of you adds an incredible value through your contributions to this company.
Yes. So today is for you and you and you and you and you and you. You make the
diﬀerence. And we appreciate you for all that you do. So on behalf of the leadership
team, I want to say thank you, associates.
So now who's in the arena today? You all have no idea how much fun this is, oh my
God. So let's hear from the people leads. Isabel? Are you in the house somewhere?

Okay. Let's hear it one more time for all of our associates. Make some noise.

Hello, hello, hello. Good morning. That was amazing. Good morning. Hello, hello,
hello. Good morning. Wait a minute. Is it true, do you all work at Walmart? Is that for
real? You all work at Walmart? Really? How's everyone feeling this morning? Wait, I'm
so sorry. I'm sorry, let me get this straight. They told me you'd be rowdy. They told
me you'd be excited. How is everyone feeling? Oh, oh, that's what it takes. Okay.
Come on. Let's hear it. Hello. Hello. I see you. Hello, hello. Thank you.
My name is Jennifer Garner. And I cannot believe I'm here today in Bud Walton
Arena in Northwest Arkansas, completely surrounded by 14,000 of my closest
friends from Walmart. Maybe you've seen me in things like Alias or 13 Going on 30
or Love, Simon. Thank you. But if you haven't seen them, they're available on
Walmart.com or VUDU.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07

Page 4 of 44I live in L.A. now. But I grew up in Charleston, West Virginia. Do we have any
mountaineers? That's my girl. What's up? I remember when Walmart moved into
town. Well ﬁrst, before we had Walmart, we had Sam's Club. What? We did. As a
matter of fact -- thank you. Yes. But then we got a Walmart. And Walmart was a place
everyone went, a place where all our neighbors shopped for everything. It's a place
where you'd run into your friends and where you'd go to catch up with your next-
door neighbor because they probably worked there. It was a new way to spend
Saturday night. And our store was an important part of our community. It still is. But
Walmart's reach has grown a lot bigger than Bentonville, Arkansas and Charleston,
West Virginia.
Today, you serve over 275 million people every single week. And around the world,
2.2 million people, just like you, put on a Walmart vest and go to work to make a
diﬀerence. So thank you. Thank you. Associates, listen up. You are the reason we are
celebrating this morning. That's what today is all about.
So all right. To get things started, I want to just have a sense of who is in the room
here. I know I have 1 West Virginia girl. In this arena, there are -- thank you, baby. In
this arena, there are over 6,000 invited associates from 27 countries. Let's hear it.
Okay. All right. Canada, I see you, Canada. All right, we've got Canada, that's right.
Let's hear it from the associates from Asia. Hello. Okay. Canada, we got you, Canada.
Thank you. Okay. Let's hear it from Africa. Yes. The United States, is anyone here from
the United States of America? What? Hello. Hello. And how about from Sam's Club?
You weren't kidding. They warned me about you guys. I know all about you.
While we're making noise, let's hear it for the performers one more time who kicked
this oﬀ. Weren't they great? I don't want to brag. But I used to play the saxophone. E-
ﬂat, alto. It's true. It's true. Her name was Sally, the sexy saxophone. I asked Doug if I
could join the opening number. But his advice was let's leave it to the talent search
winners. But I submitted. Let's see a clip of my submission.
(presentation)
I mean right? What more do you want? Maybe next year, do you think? Okay, good.
Sharing the stage with these great performers is just one of the reasons I'm here
today. Getting to say thank you for the work you do is another. But there's a third
reason I'm excited to be here. It's because we have a little something in common,
you and me. Walmart is so big and so much a part of so many communities around
the world, there is nothing you can do that somebody somewhere doesn't notice.
Every little thing you do gets reported in the news. I know what it's like, guys. We're
just the same. Walmart associates, they're just like us.
So when you go shopping or you do something nice for someone or there's an
alligator in your store, when you get coﬀee or a goose family makes a home in your
parking lot or you wash out to sea in a kayak. I mean can we get a break, right? Am I

Gregory Boyd PennerThe last one is a little bit of a story. On a pre-back-to-school getaway with my eldest
daughter to Sweden, do we have anyone from Sweden? All right, okay. Thank you.
We ended up taking a kayak trip. Did we get lost in the kayak? Yes. We did. Did we
paddle as hard as we could and end up in a shipping lane? Yes. We did. Did we have
to be rescued? Yes. We did. That was a good parenting moment.
It is so hard to be in the news so much it wears on you. And Walmart is mentioned
60,000 times a day on social media, 60,000 times a day. So let me share some
advice. The next time you ﬁnd an alligator in produce or you get lost at sea, it's okay,
don't sweat the small stuﬀ. It's all good, it's all good.
All right. We have a great show planned. And now I want to introduce you to our ﬁrst
speaker. I heard last year, he climbed Mount Everest. So next time, Greg, let's try
something challenging like kayaking. Please welcome the Chairman of Walmart
Board of Directors, Greg Penner.

Good morning. It's my honor as your Chairman to welcome you to the 49th Annual
Walmart Associate and Shareholders' Meeting. What an incredible year we've had at
Walmart. Our sales are strong, we're growing rapidly in new areas. And our
shareholders are being rewarded with a rising stock price. I'm as excited about
Walmart's future as I've ever been.
For me, this event is always a reminder of just how right Sam was about the most
important part of our company. It's why I chose to wear this pin today. It's the one
that Sam always wore out in the stores. And it says, "Our people make the
diﬀerence." Thank you, Walmart associates.
Since I ﬁrst stood on this stage as your Chairman, I've talked about the importance of
taking risks. Last year, as Jennifer mentioned, I spoke about taking some of my ownFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07

Gregory Boyd Pennerrisks and climbing Mount Everest. This year, I didn't do anything so dramatic to make
my point. And that includes a kayaking trip. But at Walmart, we're still taking bold
risks. We're changing quickly to be able to serve our customers in new ways. And
we're better positioned where it matters most.
What's interesting is that leaders outside our company are starting to take notice.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who has led one of the great corporate
transformations in recent history, said this about our omnichannel experience.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Walmart story, as I think about it, it's the innovation that you're going to bring
grounded in what uniquely only Walmart can do.
{BIO 5585986 <GO>}
And former Ohio Gov. John Kasich said this about a Walmart Academy graduation.
{BIO 13387851 <GO>}
This unbelievable story about Walmart University and the guy that walked across the
stage, never even graduated from high school. And his family is there, all wearing
suits. And they're all sitting up. And they're cheering, that was a great thing.
{BIO 5585986 <GO>}
And ﬁnally, one member of the investment community said this about our recent
business performance.
I covered the company for a long time. And I don't recall a period where it's been
running this well given what's happening in retail.
{BIO 5585986 <GO>}
For our company, it's no longer a question of whether we need to transform. We've
moved beyond that. Our success will be determined by the risks we take, the
changes we make and how we manage this transformation.
I'm conﬁdent in our future because of our people. And that's true at every level,
including our leadership team. In my over 20 years of serving on corporate Boards
and 11 years on the Walmart Board, I've never seen a stronger senior management
team than this one. And we are really fortunate to have them. The entire Board feels
this way.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07

Page 7 of 44The other day -- thank you. The other day, I came across an interesting memo written
by one of our leaders. And I want to share a few excerpts with you.
Retailing always changes. That change is driven by the customer and fueled by
ingenuity. Retailers come and go. The technology exists: information superhighway,
virtual reality, 3D television, cable TV systems. Our customer wants to be able to
shop conveniently, save money and trust the company that gets their money.
Shopping primarily for convenience, this will be done electronically and interactively.
Home delivery will have to play a part. It's easy. Electronic retailing can tailor an
assortment to a particular individual. Information is the key. This could potentially be
our most important asset.
It's amazing how much this memo gets right about where we are today and how we
are looking at the future. But what's really amazing is that it was written by our
President and CEO, Doug McMillon, 25 years ago. I'll say it again: we have great
leaders who are uniquely positioned to lead us at this moment. I am optimistic about
Walmart's future because of them, because of all of you, our associates. On behalf of
the Board and our family, thank you.
Now I want to take a moment to introduce your Board of Directors. I'd like to ask
each Board member to stand when I call their name. And please hold your applause
until the end. Audit Committee Chair, retired KPMG Chairman and CEO, Tim Flynn;
Morgan Stanley Vice Chairman of Wealth Management, Carla Harris; McDonald's
President and CEO, Steve Easterbrook; former American Airlines Chairman and CEO,
our Lead Independent Director and Nominating and Governance Committee Chair,
Tom Horton; former Yahoo! President and CEO and now Cofounder of Lumi Labs,
Marissa Mayer; Walmart President and CEO and visionary memo writer, Doug
McMillon; Strategic Planning and Finance Committee Chair and Nextdoor CEO,
Sarah Friar; Compensation, Management and Development Committee Chair and
former PepsiCo Chairman and CEO, Steve Reinemund; Technology and eCommerce
Committee Chair and RZC Investments Founder and Chairman, Steuart Walton; and
of course, my predecessor as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Rob Walton.
We thank you all for your willingness to continue to serve. I'm also excited to
introduce one new independent member of the Board, Cesar Conde. Cesar, stand
up. Cesar is the Chairman of NBCUniversal International Enterprises and
NBCUniversal Telemundo Group. We're incredibly fortunate to have him as a part of
our company. And we value the contributions he's already making. Thank you, Cesar.
Now I have one more piece of business to take care of before we proceed. On
Wednesday, we held a formal meeting where we heard proposals and cast votes.
The preliminary voting results were included in a press release that is now available
on our corporate website. Let me share those with you now.
All 12 director nominees were elected, the nonbinding advisory resolution regarding
our executive compensation was approved, the proposal ratifying the appointment
of Ernst and Young as our independent accountants was approved. And each of theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07

results will be disclosed next week in a ﬁling with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
Now let's get on with the fun of the meeting. Thank you.
{BIO 3828444 <GO>}
Thank you, Greg. Can I tell you one of my favorite things at Walmart? Store Maps. I
love Store Maps. Let me tell you why. So I actually do quite a bit of shopping at
Walmart. I mean I'm your customer. Some of you might know, I work with
organizations that help give kids a healthy start in life. And I have been known to hit
up local Walmart stores and ﬁll up shopping carts with supplies for kids and their
families. It's so much fun. But Walmart supercenters are huge, huge. It's extremely
easy to ﬁll up multiple carts with all kinds of useful stuﬀ. But it can be really tricky to
ﬁnd, I don't know, penguin shampoo.
(presentation)
I know what that is. It's so ridiculous. Store Maps answer an important question,
what's in your Walmart? Thank you, thank you. I didn't realize how huge Walmart was
until I started talking to the team here. The average Supercenter carries over
100,000 items. Yes. I mean hello, that's a lot of stocking. Give yourselves a hand.
When you're adding Walmart.com, you carry about 75 million items. And Walmart
has more than 11,000 stores around the world, around the world, I tell you. With that
big of a footprint, I bet you guys sell like a lot of penguin shampoo.
But I'm going to stop sharing stats and turn the stage over to someone who really
knows Walmart's numbers. Please give a warm welcome to Walmart's Chief Financial
Oﬃcer, Brett Biggs.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
How are you? Why not? That was better than James Corden, I admit it. I was going to
apologize to my wife. But she's not worried, I can tell at all. She sat there and going,
yes, no, not worried. You having fun? This is amazing. This is one of my favorite, like,
10 minutes of the year, is being able to stand up here and see this, it's just
unbelievable.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong becoming the ﬁrst person to
walk on the moon, which was one of the -- yes, it was one of the greatest feats of
human innovation and teamwork. It was a truly global event. Now about eight years
before that, U.S. President John F. Kennedy made a commitment that we would put a
man on the moon and bring him back, which if you were the guy being sent to the
moon, that's really, really important that we're going to bring you back. When
President Kennedy made this commitment, many, including the team at NASA, didn't
even know for sure if it was possible.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 44Okay. So you're maybe sitting there and saying, why are we getting a history lesson?
What does this have to do with Walmart? And I'm going to answer that question. Just
months after the commitment to go to the moon, another historic event was
unfolding right here in Northwest Arkansas. And that's when Sam Walton and his
family opened the ﬁrst Walmart discount store. Mr. Sam had been working in retail
for years and saw an opportunity to create a business model that could disrupt
everything that people knew about retail. Mr. Sam set out on a mission to help all
people save money and live better, which was a bold goal. Because you see, the big
successful retailers at that time had only focused on large cities. But Mr. Sam wanted
everyone to have the beneﬁt of low prices no matter where they live.
But like the moon commitment, some thought the ideas would not work. And I give
you one word for that, which would be: wrong. How about 2 words? Really wrong.
Store #1 in Rogers, Arkansas, as you see here, did about $1 million in sales in the ﬁrst
year. Not bad. Check out this number: $514 billion. That's our revenue this past year. I
do -- I think we might be a big company someday. What do you guys think? Maybe?
I got a chance.
But let me tell you some more amazing things about your company. We have
operations in 38 countries, including our sourcing oﬃces. Last year, we generated
just under $28 billion of operating cash ﬂow. And over the past three years
combined, that number is $88 billion. We have one of the highest credit ratings in
the world because of our strength and because of our size. We returned $13.5 billion
to shareholders last year. And we recently increased our dividend for the 46th
straight year, amazing.
Our expenses as a % of sales decreased last year. Thank you for helping us control
our costs. You're doing a great job. Inventory as a % of sales decreased. You've done
a great job in managing inventory levels while keeping in-stock levels really high for
our customers, which we know is so important.
Here's a really amazing fact, though. Over the last three years, we've grown our sales
by about $32 billion. That's the equivalent of adding a Fortune 100 company, a
company with the sales volume of Coca-Cola. Our company is so strong.
But these results are only possible because of our amazing associates right here and
all over the world. I heard there might be some people here from Walmart U.S. Is
that true? Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 3.6% last year. That's the highest annual
growth rate in 10 years. Amazing.
How about U.S. eCommerce? Sales grew 40% last year, nearly doubling the size of
that business over the past two years. Unreal. Way to go. So we'll now go on a 1-
minute delay. How about Sam's Club? I didn't really mean 1 minute, we've lost
control. So last year, Sam's Club comp sales, excluding fuel and tobacco, increased
5.7%. Way to go. And I notice a few people I see from our international markets, just
a few. So 8 of 10 of our markets posted positive comp sales last year. And weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 44acquired a majority stake in Flipkart in India. Got a Flipkart team down here. And as
you know, India is a really important part of our long-term strategy.
But at Walmart, all these big numbers, they're just simply a result of thousands and
thousands of daily actions by individual associates and by teams. And I want to give
you a couple of examples. Henry Akwa-Mensah and our international supply chain
team developed a new app called Plan your Day to help warehouse associates be
more eﬃcient. All right, there we go. This app is used already in Central America and
has driven a 20% eﬃciency in service to the stores. But the really cool thing about
this app is that it's now being deployed across the Walmart International supply
chain. So great synergies. And Henry is here with us. Henry, can we recognize you?
Great work. Yes, really nice work to you and your team.
Okay. And you knew we have a sales example, right? Sales drive everything. So Ryan
Joash is a fresh associate in Store 4390 in Enid, Oklahoma. We have some Okies
here, all right. He's driven a 380%, 380% sales increase in chuck roast, now not the
ﬂashiest product to try to grow that way but the type of product that's so important
to our customers. He saw an opportunity to drive sales of this item. And he ordered
more inventory and started promoting with his customers. He won over a small
business, Sandy's Tacos, which is now ordering the roast weekly to supply their
restaurant.
Now they're also buying several thousand dollars of produce and other items every
month. So that's how you take a common item. And you drive sales with creativity
and passion. And Ryan is here with us, too. Ryan, would you stand up? Great work.
Really nice. I told him he's going to like seeing his picture on that big screen.
Sam Walton once summed up Walmart like this: ordinary people joined together to
accomplish extraordinary things. And those stories that we just told along with these
big numbers are exactly what Mr. Sam was talking about.
But I want to ﬁnish up with one more number. This is our stock price for the last three
years on the day of the Shareholders' Meeting. So three years ago, $71; two years
ago, almost $80; a year ago, almost $83. So really nice trend. But as Greg mentioned,
what I really like is our stock price yesterday, $105.11. That's great. So that means that
over the past three years, the value of our company has grown by over $90 billion
because of you. Our investors are noticing what we're doing. And they see a bright
future in this company. It's because of you, your curiosity, your ideas, your teamwork,
your leadership, your desire to win every day. You are extraordinary people doing
extraordinary things.
I've been with this great company for 19 years. And I've never been more excited
about the future of this company and what we can do together. We might not be
sending people to the moon. But I can tell you we're making a massive diﬀerence in
the lives of the 275 million customers we serve each week around the globe. Thank
you for everything that you're doing and making this one of the greatest companies
in the world. Thank you very much.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07

allows customers to quickly receive up to 200,000 of our top items. And the
incredible thing is it actually costs us less to deliver orders the next day because
items come from a single fulﬁllment center located near the customer and the orders
arrive in one box.
NextDay is pretty awesome. But we can deliver groceries even faster. In fact, we can
deliver groceries same day. And earlier today, we announced something new:

Let's give Soﬁa another round of applause. Wow, what a crazy day. First I'm in the
website. And now I'm getting deliveries from Soﬁa Vergara. Unbelievable.
And you're all doing unbelievable things for our customers and stores every day.
We've been doing it with grocery pickup and delivery. And we did it with Check Out
With Me and Store Maps last holiday. We're doing so many great things. But we
need to keep skating to where the puck is going. Look at what's happening in Store
4841 in Levittown, New York. It's home to our intelligent retail lab where we're testing
ideas that can revolutionize retail as we know it. Just imagine using computer vision
and artiﬁcial intelligence to see your inventory levels in real time, both on the sales
ﬂoor and in the back room. It will allow us to speed up section work, improve on-
shelf availability and have more face time with customers.
Then there's Jetblack, which we announced last year. It brings conversational
commerce to life and customers are absolutely loving it. Today, more than 2/3 of
Jetblack members engage with us weekly, spending on average $1,500 per month.
Then there's virtual reality and augmented reality. We saw VR in action this year and
actually trained dragons in our parking lots. How about that? And with AR, imagine
allowing customers to see things in stores that aren't physically there like price
comparisons and product reviews. And I'd love to see those same glasses used to --
Tony Stark our associates and give you all superpowers to serve our customers in
magical ways.
This is our future. It's fast, it's fun, it's saving customers money and time. Each day is
an opportunity to dream up new ways to make the impossible possible, to transform
the shopping experience. With this team, just imagine the possibilities. Thank you.

you too, Jen.
{BIO 3828444 <GO>}
Thank you.
{BIO 20679101 <GO>}
It's hard to believe this is my very ﬁrst shareholders' meeting.
{BIO 3828444 <GO>}
It's so fun, isn't it? I have a trick to show you. Watch this. Sam's Clubs? All right. But
you know what -- you just have to wait.

All right. So I would be remiss if I didn't do Walmart U.S., give some noise.
{BIO 3828444 <GO>}
Very good. That's very impressive. I mean they're great. Now as I understand that you
are Walmart's ﬁrst Chief Customer Oﬃcer. Is that right? What does that mean?
{BIO 20679101 <GO>}
So I am, Jen. So what I think about at Walmart, what I think is so special is that since
our origin when Sam Walton founded the company, we've always been a customer-
centered organization. But when we think about it, the customer is changing. And
that means that we have to change, too. Our customers are so busy these days. And
we have to work hard to make their lives easier. And we do that by looking at all of
Walmart, all of the people in this room, whether it's Walmart.com, whether it's
grocery pickup and delivery and everything in between. And we need to think about
it in a uniﬁed way. We have to ensure that no matter how a customer shops with us,
we make that shopping experience better.
Now we know that all customers have choices. But we have to make their choice
really easy, choose Walmart.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07

Could you please tell me more about the easy thing? I could use more easy in my

{BIO 20679101 <GO>}
Well who doesn't need more easy in their life, right? So we know that just like all of
you here, all of our customers are diﬀerent. But what they tell us is that they all need
the same thing. What they need us to do is help them save money. But to also help
us save time. But saving time looks really diﬀerent depending on what you have
going on in your life. It makes sense, right?
{BIO 3828444 <GO>}
I can't wait to ﬁnd out how you help.
{BIO 20679101 <GO>}
Okay, Jen. So I know you well enough to know that you have a lot going on in your
life. So what we're going to do is take a look at your life and see if we can save you
some time, all right?
{BIO 3828444 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 20679101 <GO>}
All right. So to do that, I started by doing a little bit of research on your Instagram
page. So let's take a look.

Okay. So that looked like quite the undertaking. And did you start that at 5:30 in the
morning?
{BIO 3828444 <GO>}
I did. It's for breakfast for my kids.

have next-day delivery from Walmart.com.
{BIO 3828444 <GO>}
What about this day? I could have really used some help here.
{BIO 20679101 <GO>}
Okay. So on this one, I think we got you covered. You need to go into our store for
this one. You could have ordered that awesome birthday cake online ahead of time
using a new service we have on our app. And I know you love our Store Maps. And
that would have been the perfect tool to help you ﬁnd the costume and also ﬁnd
where we carry face paint, assuming of course you don't do that every day.
{BIO 3828444 <GO>}
Not every day. I love the Store Maps, yes. You're making this easier than my son did.
He was not as impressed. Okay. Here is a tricky one, are you ready? How about
returns?
{BIO 20679101 <GO>}
Returns? All right, well like how about returning something like the mouthguard you
wore here.

So I have this one down. It's easy, you could use Express Returns. So even if you
bought that -- I don't even know what it was, contraption online, you could bring it
back to any 1 of our 4,700 stores here in the U.S.
{BIO 3828444 <GO>}
Okay. Well consider that done. What about when I really don't feel like doing
anything?
{BIO 20679101 <GO>}
Okay. I got you covered on this one, too. Grocery delivery, it is. So order from the
comfort of your couch. And we're going to bring those much needed supplies right
to your door. And did you know, Jen, we have more than 30,000 personal shoppers
who help pick orders for our grocery, pickup and delivery customers, just like

John R. FurnerHello, Walmart. Good morning. Good morning, everyone. I haven't even said it yet.
No, not yet.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Good morning. Let me introduce Keri. And Keri is a technologist based in California.
And like many people here, today is her very ﬁrst shareholders. So welcome, Keri.
That's true. Thank you. John, this is amazing.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
That's right. And there are many great Walmart associates here from all over the
world today. And we might as well say it, there's one special group, right?
John, are you talking about Sam's Club?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
I was. I was. I was. All right, all right. Thank you. We do have special associates.
There's no question about that. And that is why we're making a lot of progress right
now. We're improving our product oﬀering, we're driving sales, we're driving traﬃc
and our member base is growing. So let me say it ﬁrst, a big thank you to our team.
And I wanted Keri to help me talk about innovation because innovation is happening
all over the company and yes, it is happening in the club business. But Keri, you work
on our product management team and when we talk about product management,
that's not a product like merchandise, it's a technology product. So tell us what you
and the team do.
John, here's what we do. We ﬁgure out how technology can help our clubs, we talk
to our members, we talk to our associates. We're always listening for ways that we
can reduce friction. From there, we go to work, ﬁnding the best solutions. One
example of this is our Scan & Go technology, which lets a member completely skip
the checkout line.

John R. FurnerAnd you can see a lot of the great work that Keri and her fellow associates are doing
at our new Sam's Club Now location, which happens to be -- hold on -- which
happens to be located in the Lower Greenville Neighborhood in Dallas, Texas. So
Keri, tell us about Sam's Club Now.
This club is a living testbed for our company's innovation. We're testing new features
that we think will have a big impact for our chain, whether it's adding barcode-less
scanning to Scan & Go or new augmented reality concepts that bring our products
to life. Sam's Club Now is about ﬁguring out the future of retail.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
And the new club, it is -- it's a great story. It's really a great story. But the story of how
it got oﬀ the ground is even better. We set an aggressive target to bring the club to
life, from six months from conception all the way to grand opening. That's what we
did, right?
Yes, just six months. That's correct, John.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
That's right. That's right. But Keri and a few of her colleagues, they approached this
challenge in a really interesting way. They rented a house in the Lower Greenville
neighborhood, just walking distance from the club. They lived in the house, they
coded in the living room and they chased the sun with late-night calls to colleagues
on the other side of the world. Take a look.
(presentation)
So Keri is here with the rest of the Lower Greenville crew, we've got Keith, Robert
and Michael and I know -- congrats guys. And I know we loved how you worked fast,
you worked start-up style and you did it inside of a big company. Now we're aware
that you're proud of the club. But we are really proud of you. So thanks to all of you.
And there are so many great associates all over like Keri, Keith, Michael and Robert,
who are helping us innovate. And example, this is Pooja Tejura, she's an engineer at
our San Bruno oﬃce and she helped redesign the cart and checkout pages on
SamsClub.com, making the -- and it made the process 4x faster, 4x faster, which
contributed to our 28% eCommerce growth just this year. Then these engineers in
Bangalore, India. They built a new system that allow us to deliver eCommerce orders
both from fulﬁllment centers and from clubs. And the system has cut an entire day
out of the supply chain.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07

Tyler GlennNow one thing that we've always said is our best ideas come from our associates.
And last year, our team had a really good idea. And the team noticed that when they
wanted to know something at home like directions how to get to a location or the
score of their favorite team, they could just ask their phone. And they thought we
should be able to work the same way in our clubs.
Now Craig Robinson, he leads our Bots and Search team. So Craig and a group of
technologists, operators, engineers, they went to work on creating a mobile app you
can simply speak to, to get information. And we call it Ask Sam. Now you can speak
to this app and ask it anything about the club, just like you would your phone at
home. And this is (Audrey) and (Justin) and they're going to show you how it works.
(presentation)
And this app is now live at all of our clubs. And it's already answered 1.5 million
questions. And it just happens to be that those 1.5 million questions all came from
associates who work at Sam's Club. And it's great innovation. And thank you to Craig
and the team for the ideas. But innovation like that, it doesn't just happen. It takes
people on diﬀerent teams on diﬀerent continents all working together and chasing
the sun and staying focused on serving the end users of their products. And those
end users, they are our associates, they're our members. And it's all working. And
when we innovate and when you innovate. And we do it together, we're able to
make life easier. And that's when we know it's all worth it. Thank you, Sam's Club.

{BIO 3522084 <GO>}
Good morning, Walmart. Today, we recognize another extraordinary Walmart
associate with the Sam M. Walton Entrepreneur Award. This past March, the state of
Nebraska was hit with massive ﬂooding. One of our stores, #776 in Fremont,
Nebraska, 23 associates tragically lost everything. Another 100 associates from that
same store, 1/3 of its workforce, had to be evacuated from their homes and they
were not allowed back into their homes. Despite this severe hardship, the store
manager and their associates stepped up, they quickly secured ﬁnancial assistance
to help associates to get back on their feet. They facilitated major donations to the
Red Cross, the United Way and the local shelter. And they led an eﬀort with over 50
associates from the area to help shop for people who had lost their homes. All the
while they worked overtime to quickly restock the store, collect and deliver
merchandise donations and volunteer at organizations -- managing response eﬀorts.
As we've seen before in our company's history, when the associates of Store 776
were needed most, they showed Walmart at its very best. They were very much
inspired by the leadership of their store manager. She's a 16-year Walmart veteran
who started her career as a cashier. She's a true champion of our culture, energetic,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07

is April Coolidge. And I am so proud to be a Walmart truck driver out of Pageland,
South Carolina. It is my honor to represent Walmart as an American Trucking
Associations 2019, 2020 Americas Road Team Captain.

{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Thank you, April. Good morning, Walmart. How's everyone doing? So Walmart U.S.,
are you in the house?
I want to start by thanking the U.S. team. You know you turned in a fantastic
performance last year and you've kept the momentum going with online grocery
and pickup. You've implemented lots of new technology. Comp sales have been
strong, helped by some great work by our merchants, including things like
reinvention of our apparel new brands, Wonder Nation, Terra & Sky, Time and Tru.
And great new items like those Marketside fresh soups. So again, I just want to say
thank you.
Before I came to live in the U.S., I was essentially a tourist. I was familiar with the
places that tourists know, places like New York, Los Angeles, Yosemite, the Grand
Canyon. And during the nearly ﬁve years I've lived here, however, I've now been to
every state. And most of them, more than once.
And what I have come to realize is just how unique the towns and neighborhoods
where you live and work are. And I've come to understand just how unique
Walmart's connection is with those communities and the depth of our relationship
with them. The relationships are powerful because they're personal. And the more
personal and consistent those relationships, the more substantial and reliable the
trust they inspire. I believe we have an obligation to our customers and their
neighborhoods to build that trust.
Our host is a person who understands this. And I asked her if she'd join me out here
to chat about it.

Well -- well, we're glad to have you here.

Greg, I've heard you talk about your view of the country and the role that Walmart
plays. And I think we've got a lot in common.
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Yes. You and I have had the chance to spend a little bit of time talking. And we've
talked about the way that you approach the work you do with children in poverty.
{BIO 3828444 <GO>}
I have been fortunate to have the chance to get to know children who come from
underserved communities. That work has taken me all around our beautiful country.
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
As you've traveled around, is there anything that stood out for you in terms of the
kinds of things that you feel have made a diﬀerence?
{BIO 3828444 <GO>}
Well what's been surprising to me is that it doesn't always take a big eﬀort to make a
huge impact.
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
There's a story that you've shared with me along the lines that I ﬁnd really inspiring.
So can you share it with everyone here?
{BIO 3828444 <GO>}
Absolutely. I work with Save the Children's U.S. programs, which has coordinators
that lead our work in the ﬁelds. They make visits to families who are dealing with the
stressors of poverty. They bring toys and books, things that help very young children,
many are babies, with cognitive development.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07

Gregory S. ForanOne of the things we brought was a ball, a simple little ball. At one point during our
visit, we said to the mother, you should roll the ball to your son. And she did. The
little boy looked at the ball. This new thing, not quite sure what to do with it. Then he
imitated his mom and he rolled it back. His mom rolled it to him again. And this time,
the little boy made a noise. And the coordinator said to the mother, "The baby is
talking to you." The mother said, "No, my baby doesn't know how to talk." And the
coordinator said, "He is talking to you, say something back to him." The mother
made babbling sounds back to her boy, baby noises. And he made noises back. And
all of a sudden, there was a conversation between this mother and her baby. There
was a connection and a light went on in this little boy's eyes.
Greg, as they continue to play like that over time, it will literally change the way that
this little baby boy's brain develops. And that story sums it up. A ball. A small thing
making a huge diﬀerence.
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
I love that story. And what sticks out for me is the light that's going on in that little
boy's eyes. That light, I think of it as a spark. And as you know, the spark is a really
important part of Walmart's culture.
{BIO 3828444 <GO>}
The thing about the spark, it might not be totally obvious. Sometimes, you may not
even notice it. But it's there, maybe in someone's eyes or maybe in someone's heart.
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
And it's real. It's genuine. It's completely honest. It's a human connection. And I think
that's what we're talking about.
{BIO 3828444 <GO>}
I think so. It's great to have a chance to work with a company and with people,
people like all of you, who want to lead with heart and build trusting relationships

relationship.
You see, personal relationships are the only way that we can uphold the principles
upon which our founder, Sam Walton, built our company. And to be perfectly honest,
I think personal relationships are the basis for how we at Walmart, or anyone else at
that matter, can uphold many of the values which bring out the best of humanity.
If each of us builds those kinds of relationships reasonably well, we can help make a
meaningful diﬀerence in people's lives and in the neighborhoods where they live
and they work. And by doing that honestly, by doing that well, we create a spark.
And when we create a spark and we light that light, amazing things start to happen.

good morning, Walmart. I'm delighted to be here and have the chance to speak to
you today. Do you know that video reminds me of why I love this week so much. It's
a week that's all about celebrating our culture and sharing those kind of special
moments together. But above all, as you've heard, this week is all about you. It's a
celebration. A celebration of everything that you do and that you do at Walmart.
So like many people, before I do anything else, to every one of our associates in
every country around the world that we operate, let me say a huge thank you. Thank
you for making a diﬀerence to our customers, to each other and to our business.
This morning, you've already heard about the strength of our company. We've seen
some exciting innovations and we've talked about a journey to become more
customer-centric. We've heard more about what we're doing as a company for
communities. And I love the way that Greg talked about the spark inside everybody
that we can ignite.
The world is undoubtedly changing fast. And so is our business. And around the
world and international, we're partnering with businesses inside and outside of the
company to build an even stronger business, strong local businesses powered by
Walmart. That's what we do.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07

Judith McKennaStrong local businesses is all about being relevant for the customer in every market
that we operate in and it's also about positioning our businesses for long-term
success. Powered by Walmart is all about the unique leverage that our scale, our
capabilities and our talent can bring across the Walmart family. And Brett told you
earlier that last year, Walmart achieved positive comps in 8 out of 10 of our
businesses. We invested in India with Flipkart. We continued our expansion in
omnichannel focusing on grocery. And we deepened our relationships around the
world with partners such as Rakuten in Japan and Dada in China. Hello, China.
The work that we're doing is actually powered by our associates. And it's supported
by the innovation everywhere around the world. Now to bring that to life, I want to
start with a story about collaboration from Walmart Mexico. Did you know, Walmart
Mexico led International last year in total growth. So thank you very much for your
results as well.
But the team are also changing the way they work in big and fundamental ways to
become an even better business. And out there with his team is Gui Loureiro, who is
our President and CEO of Walmart y Centro Mexico y Centro America. Hello, Gui.
{BIO 7184171 <GO>}
Hello. Hola, Judith. And buenos dias, Walmart Mexico Centro America. (foreign
language)
It's an honor to share what we are doing in Mexico to transform and become a more
agile organization. As you mentioned, we are changing how we think, how we
approach problems and how we work more collaboratively.
We are putting our customers and associates at the center of every decision. And we
are using data and technology to make better and faster decisions. One example of
this is Cashi. Cashi is our digital wallet which we are currently testing in the market.
Through Cashi, we will provide access to digital payments and ﬁnancial services that
create a stronger digital connection with our customers.
In Mexico, nearly 1/3 of the population has neither a credit card nor a bank account.
This is a unique opportunity for us in Walmart Mexico to make life easier for our
customers. Today, we are oﬀering the ability to deposit money into cash at our
stores. And with their new digital wallet, customers can use to pay for everyday items
as well as gain access to everyday service like Netﬂix, Spotify, Uber, cable TV and
utilities.
So Judith, we are really excited about the transformation journey we have begun in
Mexico. And Cashi is another step in the right direction when it comes to moving fast
and ﬁnding new ways to serve our customers.

Page 33 of 44Gui, thank you. Thank you. And thank you to the whole team for everything you're
doing to help reimagine your business. What's really special about Cashi is it's
actually a story that's a true example of what can happen when you bring the full
power of Walmart together. The Mexico team partnered with teams from Bentonville
and from California to actually produce a product that not only empowers
customers. But it helps us build an even stronger business.
Another one of our businesses that's doing a great job of getting stronger by
building on a culture of innovation and working together is China. They're the team,
along with you Yuen Tan, their CEO, has launched Omega 8. They launched this
product earlier this year. It's an initiative which is bringing together 50 startups to
explore how cutting-edge technology can help solve really speciﬁc customer pain
points and make life easier for our associates as well.
Already, they're developing and testing some remarkable innovations. They're using
computer vision to identify products and make shopping simpler for customers.
They're experimenting with robots in back rooms and in distribution centers to
increase capacity and eﬃciency. And they're also testing wearable technology to
enable associates to quickly pick and sort items so we can have faster pickup and
delivery.
It's such an important part of our strategy to make life easier for our customers and
for our associates. Omega 8 is a brilliant example of that. And believe me, there's a
lot more to come this year and beyond.
But we've talked a lot today about technology and we've talked about how we're
putting it to work at Walmart. But at the end of the day, nothing is actually possible
without people. Great people like you make great things happen. To have great
people, you need to have an inclusive business. Everywhere we operate, we're
working hard to be a more inclusive business so that people can always bring their
best selves to work.
One of my favorite examples of this is in Flipkart. They have a delivery business
called eKart that delivers right across India. And what I really love is the fact they call
their delivery experts Wishmasters because not only are they mastering the art of
delivery. But they're treating every order as a customer's wish. And not only that,
they're doing something really special to create an inclusive business as well. Take a
look at this.

We have heard several inspiring stories this morning, examples of the good that
Walmart does when it channels its strength. And most of all, your passion for making
a diﬀerence.
One of the reasons I'm here today is to let you in on a little news. I am teaming up
with Walmart. Well you guys can't have all the fun. I am teaming up with Walmart to
kick oﬀ a new eﬀort that we think can tap into the passion that all of you have for
making a diﬀerence in your neighborhoods all over the world. It's called
#sparkKindness.
And to get the partnership going, I have set up a little challenge. Okay, here's the
deal. One of the things that I have learned is that when you really care about
something and you share those stories, you can inspire others and pass it on. You
can be the spark that ignites the passion in others for good. In fact, I'm sure you
already are.
So many of you are involved in your communities. For every story I see in the news or
on social media about the great things you do in your communities, I know there are
thousands more. The #sparkKindness challenge is a way for you to share these
eﬀorts and maybe inspire others to do the same. If you choose to take up this
challenge, you can post on your social media channels about your acts of kindness
using the #sparkKindness and Walmart Associate Challenge. Then Walmart will help
spark the kindness even further. Walmart will take a look at the posts and choose 25
of them. The associates who made those posts will get the opportunity to work with
Walmart.org to recommend a Walmart grant to a charity.
The challenge is going to get underway in the next couple of weeks. So if you're
interested in participating. And I hope all of you are, please keep checking
OneWalmart for all the details. It's really exciting. I can't wait to see what everyone
comes up with.
Our next performer I'm a crazy huge fan of. She started as a songwriter for Tim
McGraw and Kelly Clarkson in 2014. And in 2016, her debut album hit #1 on the
Billboard Country Music Chart in its very ﬁrst week. In less than three years, she has
won multiple awards, including Country Music Awards New Artist of the Year as well
as a GRAMMY Award for Best Country Solo Performance. So please, put your hands

Good morning, Walmart. Okay. All right. So John and Francisco were asked to help
solve a problem, how do we perfectly cube out our trailers all the way to the top? It's
really important that we do that as the trailers head from the DCs to the stores
because it helps us reduce road miles, improve sustainability. And it takes out cost.
And what they found was, as they dug into the problem, that we had this 2-step stool
in the trailers. And guess what? It's kind of clunky. It's a little bit big and it's a little bit
heavy.
So Francisco does this job every day and ﬁgures out that if we change to this stool,
which is lighter and easier to move around, people will actually use it all the time and
we're doing a much better job of cubing out the trailers. They've tested it in their DC.
And now, we've rolled it out to every distribution center in the United States. And it's
going to save us at least $30 million this year.
Can you thank these 2 for us? Great job. Great job. Really appreciate it. See you.
Good morning, Walmart. Have you enjoyed this week? It's been awesome to get to
meet so many of you. And I have had an absolute blast. I want to tell you that it's also
been productive. It's been productive because of you. You brought your ideas,
things we could do to improve as a company. And we are going to respond to and
implement those ideas. And we want to thank you for them and thank you for the
work that you do every day for this company.
We really do wish that every associate in the whole company could be here today. So
please, when you go back home, tell your fellow associates about your experience
and thank them for all of us for the job that you do. We really appreciate you very
much.
So at Walmart, we have our own vocabulary. We say things like VPI, Ten-Foot-Rule
and EDLP. We'll do a COE as we drive OGP on some place called Camp IV. It takes a
little while to understand the language. I remember when I ﬁrst joined the company,
I was told not to say the word, problem. Doug, around here, we say opportunity. Well
I get why we say that. We want to have a positive outlook. But the voice in my head
keeps saying some things are just ﬂat out problems. And I think our customers sayFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 36 of 44that sometimes, too, like a long checkout line's a problem, an out of stock is a
problem.
So if I were to oversimplify our ability to thrive in the future, it really comes down to
one thing. And that one thing is our ability to solve problems together well enough
and fast enough. So let's talk about problem solving.
In the early 1900s, the Wright brothers wanted to learn how to ﬂy. They called being
stuck on the ground the ﬂying problem. They failed many times. But in 1903, they
found a solution. And they ﬂew like a bird. And they changed the world.
People are always trying to solve problems. Don't want to visit a barber, get a
Flowbee and cut your own hair. Don't want to get up out of the recliner? The clapper
is for you. Don't want to go ﬁshing? Just hang a Billy Bass your wall, he'll even talk to
you. We have sold a lot of silly items over the years, some of which are trying to solve
problems we didn't even know we had.
Sam Walton was a problem solver. Sam thought people who lived in small towns
deserved lower prices on a broad assortment of quality merchandise just like people
who lived in larger towns. He saw the potential of solving the intersection of these 3
ideas. As Sam worked to get the formula right, he tackled most of the perennial
problems in retail like driving customer traﬃc. And you could see him working on
that problem in one of my favorite Walmart stories from our former CEO, David
Glass.
David was working for another retailer. And he went to check out Sam's second store
in Harrison, Arkansas. It was grand opening day in 1964. As Sam was learning to
drive customer visits and grand opening excitement, he bought a few truckloads of
watermelons and provided donkey rides for the kids. He put them both on the
parking lot to create a carnival-like atmosphere. Well David says it was about 110
degrees that day. So the watermelon started to pop and the donkeys did what
donkeys do. And it all got tracked into the store.
David said it was the worst retail store he'd ever seen. And he told Sam what he
thought. And then he went back home. But Sam was learning. And he not only
ﬁgured out how to drive traﬃc. But he also ﬁgured out how to hire David Glass. Sam,
David, Rob and the team kept improving the discount store. And then they decided
to tackle grocery. They believed there was a way to lower prices on food for America.
In his international travels, Sam had seen these giant stores with groceries and
general merchandise under one roof. So they tried them here and they called them
hypermarts. Well let's just say those didn't work. They were way too big.
But the team pivoted into supercenters. And boy, did they work. Not only did we
provide lower prices on food. But competition had to react. Just think about how
much money we have saved for people over all these years. The supercenter is an
amazing solution.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 37 of 44Just as in the past, our future depends on solving problems for customers. So which
ones should we be working on? Has anyone seen Avengers Endgame? Well one of
my favorite scenes is when Tony Stark goes back in time to meet his father. He tells
his dad, no amount of money ever bought a second of time. He's right. What's the
one thing busy families can't buy at Walmart? It's time, right? Or is it?
Lately, you've been solving problems that enable our customers to save time. They
can kind of buy time by shopping with us. I'll tell you a few stories as examples. A
few months ago, I ran over a nail and ruined a tire. So I went to Sam's Club for help.
Good morning, Sam's. So it was a Saturday. And we were busy. At one point, I'm
third in line with 2 members behind me. Our associates are working hard. But as you
can see on the screen, the process is time-consuming. As we're all waiting there in
the Bentonville Club, I can tell that one of the members in line has recognized me.
He doesn't say anything but, he didn't have to. His facial expression says it all. How's
it feel to wait in line, dude? Surely, you can do something about this. So I'm feeling
all this pressure.
So that next week, John Furner and I have a catch-up. I suggest to John, he might
want to take a look at the tire buying experience in Sam's Club. Well check out what
the team built. The app is called Sam's Garage. What used to be a 30-minute ordeal
now takes less than 5 minutes. We're going from multiple systems, paper catalogs
and a large desk to a user-friendly member grade app on a mobile tablet. We will
give hundreds of thousands of hours back to members.
This is what it looks like to be a digital company. Sam's Garage will be rolled out
nationwide in July from concept, to design, to roll out in fewer than nine months
from that Saturday when I was buying tires. I want to thank the team: Suchi
Vakkalagadda, Ayan Akbar, David Nelms. And Chris Nuta. Great work. Thank you, all.
So here's another story. About ﬁve years ago, our team in the U.K. captured our
attention with their grocery delivery service. We studied the Asda process, systems
and results, we copied them. And we launched grocery pickup in California. Once
we learned how to do pickup well, we knew it would unlock the ability to deliver.
Take a look at how you've scaled pickup and delivery around the world. Our
customers love it. This idea is a winner.
So how could we build on our pickup and delivery capabilities? Well what if we not
only covered the last mile to customer's homes. But even the last few steps? What if
we put their groceries away inside their kitchens or garages? A step beyond that,
what if they let us keep them replenished, keep them in stock on the items they use
all the time? After all, an empty refrigerator is a problem, especially if you have kids
at home. Check this out.
(presentation)
Problem solved. We think a lot of customers are going to love this. We've tested it in
a couple places. And here's how it works. All deliveries are done by associatesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 38 of 44who've been with us for at least a year. The customer is notiﬁed when we arrive at
their home. Customers can watch a live ﬁrst person view of their delivery or a
recording of it later. We're excited to announce in-home delivery will start this fall
available to nearly 1 million customers across 3 cities: Kansas City, Pittsburgh and
Vero Beach, Florida.
We'll learn and then we'll scale from there. Imagine keeping homes in stock like we
do stores. Think of a pantry like a 4-feet section. This team is led by Bart Stein. From
the time he and the team joined Walmart through an acquisition, it took them only
ﬁve months to conduct their ﬁrst test. 2 associates were selected as our initial
delivery team, Debbie, Grzyb, please stand; and Quadira Sadler. And they did an
outstanding job. Thank you, Debbie. Thank you, Q.
Well you all know we made a big investment in India last year as Judith was talking
about. And it was an eCommerce business called Flipkart with a payment platform
called PhonePe. We love seeing how they solve problems. In India, there are
approximately 12 million independently owned small convenience stores called
kiranas. They've been around for generations. But they weren't equipped for digital
payments. So PhonePe developed a new app that allows kiranas to accept digital
payments without transaction fees or reimbursement delays. 4 million of them have
joined in the ﬁrst 12 months.
At Flipkart, our team created product exchange. It solves a problem for smartphone
customers who want to upgrade their devices and get a higher-value rather than
selling it for scrap. The app tests the phone remotely to assess its value, which results
in a larger discount towards a new device.
In each of these examples, notice that the solution required a combination of people
and technology. Notice that the process required us to empathize with the customer
and truly understand the points of friction that they're experiencing with us. We're
learning how to work in an agile way with customer experiences designed
thoughtfully from the start and with the technology doing more of the work so you
can focus on customers and members.
I want to thank our technology team. The partnership between business and
technology is bearing fruit.
So Sam, Rob, David. And our alumni that are sitting back here put us in a problem-
solving business from the start. And the secret was that we're all in it together,
generating ideas and working as a team. That's still happening.
A few years ago, we made some strategic choices together. We invested in you to
raise pay, build academies and provide better technology. As you improved our
store experience, we invested in lower prices. The strength of our stores gave us
room to invest more aggressively in eCommerce. Sam's Club and Walmex got
focused and stronger. As these results built on each other, it gave us the conﬁdence
to invest in Flipkart and PhonePe. Putting these pieces together is enabling us toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07

Page 39 of 44transform into an omnichannel digital enterprise, which enables us to serve
customers more eﬀectively.
By embracing change, doing things diﬀerently and taking on big challenges, you're
delivering results. Last ﬁscal year, we increased total revenue by 2.8% to more than
$514 billion. We generated $27.8 billion operating free cash ﬂow and returned $13.5
billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Your company is strong. And those numbers are big. But our goal isn't to be the
biggest, it's to be the best and to get better every day. And our goals aren't purely
ﬁnancial. We want to be a positive force in the world. We use the size of the
company to do good and to inﬂuence others. This isn't just about what we achieve.
But how we achieve it. We're out to earn trust. Acting with integrity is a core value
and it guides our behavior, our culture. We're designing compliance into our
everyday work. We're creating shared value across our stakeholder groups. That
means we not only want to serve customers and associates well. But also local
communities, society at large, our shareholders and the planet we live on.
Let's take climate change, for example. It's a big problem. And we're taking a big
swing at it. We launched Project Gigaton in 2017. Our goal is to avoid 1 billion metric
tons of emissions from our supply chain. We can't -- now we know we can't achieve
that on our own. So we asked our suppliers to partner with us. So far, more than
1,000 of them have signed on in the ﬁrst two years and they tell us more than 93
million metric tons of emissions have been avoided. We have some great suppliers.
Our global supply chain's interconnected with 3 main components, the natural
resources and raw materials that become the products we sell, the hard-working
people who make them. And the movement of those products to our customers.
Our eﬀorts are aimed at making that supply chain more eﬃcient and less wasteful.
And we want the people participating in that supply chain to thrive. We're out to
improve the total system.
The size of the company enables us to make a diﬀerence globally. But all the work
really happens locally. And I could talk to you all day about the good work you and
all of our associates are doing in our communities across the globe. But to save time,
our numbers really tell the story. We're now powered by 28% renewable energy. We
divert 78% of waste from landﬁlls. Our Acres for America program has conserved 1.4
million acres since 2005. We've hired over 225,000 U.S. veterans since 2013.
We're a top 50 diversity company. We've donated $1.4 billion in cash and in-kind
gifts just last year. And we provided 4 billion meals to those in need since 2014. You
are making a diﬀerence. It's still true that our people make the diﬀerence.
So let's talk about how we're solving problems for our associates. You're starting to
see new apps, new hardware, new forms of automation like pickup towers and ﬂoor
cleaners with cameras checking inventory. Our goal is to design tools for you just asFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07

ready to use them.
So over the last four years, we've invested an incremental $4.5 billion in pay for store
and club associates in the U.S. alone. Our starting wage rate is up 50% during that
time. We've increased the number of full-time roles and we now stand at 60% full-
time in the U.S. ahead of industry average.
We've expanded our parental leave policy. A birth mom can now receive up to 16
weeks of paid leave. We created a beneﬁt of $5,000 per child to help families that
are going through adoption. Working with partners like the Mayo Clinic. And Johns
Hopkins, we've created centers of excellence for serious health procedures such as
heart and spine surgeries, joint replacements to ensure the best care. And we will
continue investing in you. As technology changes to jobs and the tasks that make up
a job, we want you all to learn and succeed.
This week, we announced the expansion of Live Better U, our debt-free, $1 a day
college program. We added technology degrees. We added schools and support
for high school students (entering) the workforce. We also assist with college tuition
for our full and part-time associates in Canada. The expansion of our academies
around the world is an important part of our plan. We started them in the U.K.. And
with leadership from Greg and Judith, we imported them to the United States. And
now, hundreds of thousands of associates are picking up new skills each year.
Walmart represents opportunity.
My ﬁrst 2 roles with the company where hourly roles. The vast majority of our
management team started in an hourly role. Let me tell you a story about one of
them.
I recently met Shabnam Ighani. And Shabnam and her family immigrated from Iran in
2004. And when she got here, Shabnam couldn't speak English. But she was able to
get a job in a Walmart store and a support manager oﬀered to spend time with her
at lunch and on breaks with some other associates, helping her learn how to speak
English and learn more about the company. Come here, Shabnam, come stand by
me.
As she picked up the language, she became more conﬁdent. So she moved from
being an overnight stocker to managing a department to being an assistant
manager. And then she got promoted to lead one of our academies there in Dulles,
Virginia. Shabnam is an inspiration to me. And I keep telling her that she represents
many of you and all the stories that you have about what it's like to be part of
Walmart.
Well Shabnam recently interviewed for a store manager position. And I'm just
wondering if you would be interested in accepting the job of leading Fairfax
Virginia? Would you like to do that? Thank you. So much. Proud of you. I don't knowFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-07

Jennifer Garnerwhat I would've done if she had said no. And I'm not even sure if she heard where it
is. It's Fairfax, Virginia, which is close and nearby.
So she's gone from coming to our country from Iran, not having a job just in 2004.
And now, she's going to lead a big team and run a big business. And she's ready for
it.
Walmart creates opportunity. We don't shy away from problems. They actually are
opportunities. We embrace them. We grow and we change. We adapt. Our ability to
thrive in the future comes down to our ability to solve problems together. And
you've seen from these stories today that you're doing it. Associates like Shabnam,
John and Francisco, Suchi, Ayan, David, Chris, Debbie and Q. They are getting it
done. They're making it happen. And all of you are making it happen.
You help busy mom and dads save time and save money. You help people have a
better day and live a better life. You see opportunities. You solve problems. You are
the solution. Thank you.

Thank you, Doug. What a great message. Okay. We're almost done. And I've been
your Chairman now for four years. And someone just asked me backstage, why I've
never done a call out? So here we go. And don't let me down. I love shopping at
Sam's Club.
Okay. I think that might be the last one. What an incredible morning this has been,
this meeting, this week, really this entire year. And I started this meeting talking
about why I'm so excited about our future. After hearing from our leaders and so
many associates from around the world, I hope you all share in that excitement.
Walmart is strong and growing stronger at our core and in new ways. Thank you,
again on behalf of the Board and our Walton family. To all the associates here and at
home, you are deeply appreciated and you make the diﬀerence.
Now I'd like to welcome back to the stage our incredible host, with her amazing
smile and energy. Please help me appreciate Jennifer Garner. Thank you.

Unidentiﬁed ParticipantThis has been an incredible experience because of you. I can't wait to see how
everyone here works to spark kindness. And that leaves just one more thing to do,
introduce our ﬁnal performance.
I know, it's already time. Do you all remember Myspace? Anyone? I remember
Myspace. Well this band was discovered on Myspace back in 2007 and since then,
they have won several GRAMMY Awards, American Music Awards, Billboard Music
Awards and become one of the biggest hit-making musical groups of the past
decade. They're out with a brand-new single. And they're here to perform it for you
right now. So make some noise and give a huge welcome to OneRepublic.

Thank you. Hi. thanks for having us. This is kind of almost a weird homecoming for
me. My dad went to University Arkansas. My ﬁrst cousin just texted me, he's a
worship leader here in Bentonville, actually, just down the street. And I was telling
somebody backstage, everybody on this stage is from a diﬀerent part of the country
but I'm from -- born and raised in Tulsa in Oklahoma City and -- I win.
I think for 10 years of my life my mom did not make a meal where we didn't source
everything from Sam's Club or a Super Walmart. And the truth is when I was like 16, it
was like, "What do you want for Christmas?" I legit was like, "I want a Sam's Club
membership." Yes. So it was -- yes everywhere you turn I went to ORU and across the
street a SuperCenter. So I have a long history involved with this company.
You guys are doing an amazing job worldwide and here's to you.

I mean we got a video of her basically crying.
Yes, pretty much. And the Sam's Club associates, man, their energy is just
unmatched.
Okay. You all know Modern Family. I call her Gloria because we know each other
personally. When she came out, I was like, oh Lord, my wife was there with me. She's
smacking me on the back of my head. I'm like, "I'm sorry. But hey, she is gorgeous.
She is gorgeous." What about you?
Mine was the Carrie Hungerford, the 2019 Sam M. Walton Award. Congratulations to
