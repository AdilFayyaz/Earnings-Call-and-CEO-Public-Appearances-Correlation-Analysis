{BIO 1723255 <GO>}
Welcome to CES 2024. And I am so thrilled that you are back here at CES. Walmart
last joined us during our all-digital CES in 2021. A senior executive shared how
technology like robotics and AI was modernizing the company's supply chain and
the tech stack. In the three years since then, Walmart has continued to grow far
beyond its origins as just a big box store to become a fully digital enterprise. It's
putting AI to work, data to work, robotics to work and building a smarter and more
connected supply chain.
Along the way, Walmart is also doing some things. They're investing in new and
emerging technology like drone delivery and delivery into your refrigerator. And it's
also making strides in its eﬀorts to become a regenerative company, making a net
positive impact on our planet and the people who live here. That's possible because
Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, understands the power not just of investing in
technology but also of investing in people. When he was just a teenager, Doug got
his start at Walmart, working a summer job unloading trucks.
He knows the value of hard work and of adapting and running with new ideas. Over
more than 30-year career at Walmart, he served in senior leadership roles in everyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-09

retailer with more than 10,000 stores in 19 countries and worldwide revenues of $611
billion. What will Walmart do next to disrupt retail? Well, to tell us, please join me in
welcoming Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Good to see you.
{BIO 1723255 <GO>}
Welcome back. Good to see you.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Thank you. Happy to be here. Well, today, more than ever, advances in technology
make it feel like anything is possible. At Walmart, we're very excited about how we're
putting technology to work to improve the lives of our customers and associates.
And the years ahead look like anything we've seen in our past as it relates to the
magnitude of technological change in our company.
Our road map is compelling. At the same time, more broadly, as business leaders, it
seems to me that we're all facing a choice. We're standing at a fork in the road. Let
me describe two possible paths. One path is to completely prioritize technology to
maximize what's possible without considering potential implications.
The view is that if we can use technology to do something, it's inevitable that it'll
happen, so we should just go fast and exploit what's possible. It's a society driven by
data and run by increasingly intelligent software. It's a world where technology
streamlines operations without much, if any, concern for the people involved. There
are some obvious and logical arguments for this approach. Then there's the other
path.
It's more nuanced. It's one where the beneﬁts of technology are pursued, but people
are considered along the way. It's about our heads and our hearts. The underlying
principle is that we should use technology to serve people and not the other way
around. This path enables people to do things in more eﬃcient and enjoyable ways.
We're choosing the second path. We love what technology can do, but we're
building it in a way that creates better careers. At the same time, it creates better
customer experiences and a stronger business. No doubt, some tasks will go away
and some roles will change. And some of them should like the ones that involve
lifting heavy weight or doing repetitive tasks.
As that's happening, we're designing new roles that our associates tell us are more
enjoyable and satisfying and also often result in higher pay. So we're investing to
help our associates transition to this shared future. We've changed and are changingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 21Megan Croziera lot, so much so that lately I've been asked how do you even describe Walmart
today. We're a people-led, tech-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to helping
people. We want to help people live better.
That starts with saving them money, but it doesn't stop there. Simply put, our team is
dedicated to helping people improve their lives. On March 17, 1992, George H.
W. Bush came to our home oﬃce in Bentonville to present the Presidential Medal of
Freedom to our Founder, Sam Walton. Sam was battling cancer, and he would pass
away 19 days later.
After standing to receive the metal, he said the greatest thing is that we've got the
ideas from all 380,000 people in the company, and that's the best part. We're all
working together. I hope we can keep it going that way. That's the secret. That's the
key.
(video playing)
That's who we are, and that's what we want. We have 2.1 million people around the
world today working to make our purpose real. Sam challenged us to design our
business to make a bigger, more positive diﬀerence in our world. That's what
inspires us to solve problems and address our own imperfections. Making a real
diﬀerence for so many families is what gets us up and ﬁres us up every morning.
Today, we're going to show you some of the tech we're building and how it helps us
serve customers and members, our associates, communities and ultimately, society
in new ways. Technology is powering new experiences. But don't miss that this is a
story about people and their willingness to learn and change, a willingness to adapt
and our ability to imagine tomorrow and bring it to life. To help us begin telling the
story, I'd like to introduce you to someone who recently celebrated 20 years with our
company. She leads our merchandising team at Sam's Club here in the U.S., Megan
Crozier.
{BIO 21582983 <GO>}
Hi, everyone. For those of you who don't know, Sam's Club is the warehouse club
arm of Walmart, and at Sam's Club, we absolutely obsess over great items. One of
those items for me right now is the Member's Mark Butter Chicken. My girls, they say
it's the best chicken they've ever had, which makes me feel awesome as a merchant
and even better as a mom. And as a mom, what do I value just as much as feeding
my children delicious food?
My time. And that focus on delivering great items and saving our customers a
member's time, that's what's driving us to reimagine the future of retail. So I'm
excited to take a few minutes to share how we're bringing it to life in our clubs. First
of all, we have a digital relationship with our members. And when we say digital,
most people think of our curbside pickup or delivery services, which are awesome.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 21Latriece WatkinsBut something we're really proud of at Sam's Club is the digital relationship we have
with our members while they're physically shopping our clubs, and that's through
our app. Our app is far more than a place to store your digital membership cards. It
has all sorts of features from an AI-powered did you forget prompt that helps a
member not forget their favorite items to Sam's Cash, which helps our members
realize the amazing value they get from a Sam's Club membership. And then the app
has Scan & Go. You just scan your items as you put them in the cart, pay with a tap,
skip the checkout line and show your digital receipt at the exit door.
It's so intuitive too, you can use it to buy anything, a $1,000 play set, fuel or the $1.38
hotdog combo in our cafe. Scan & Go at Sam's Club reached a record level of usage
last quarter. We believe it's the most used app in the store or restaurant in the U.S.
Most important to us, our members tell us they love the convenience, but we're not
done yet. We aspire to be the most convenient place to shop.
So I'm excited to announce the next phase of our journey. Check this out.
(video playing)
Now it's one thing to enable this easy kind of exit tech in a small footprint store for a
handful of items. You've all seen it. You can get an apple, a cheese stick, maybe
something as big as a box of cereal, but we're doing it at scale. We're providing that
same seamless experience across thousands of items across our 600 clubs
nationwide. A full clean bed set?
No problem. An entire winter wardrobe? Yes. A cart full of cereal? I mean if that's
what you want, you got it.
See, at Sam's Club, we care about every second a member spends with us, so
eliminating even the few seconds it takes to scan a receipt at the exit door is well
worth it. We're live in Dallas today with this exit technology, and our plan is to roll it
out nationwide by the end of the year. And the journey continues. We'll keep ﬁnding
ways to give our members what they want most, great items, unmatched
convenience and time back for the more important things in life. Sam's Club is
people led and tech powered, and this latest innovation is just one example.
Now I'd like to introduce you to someone who has been with our company for 25
years and leads our outstanding merchandising team for Walmart U.S., Latriece
Watkins.
{BIO 18795654 <GO>}
Hi, everyone. At Walmart, we have a clear purpose: to help people save money and
live better. As merchants, we're proud of the role we get to play in delivering that
purpose. We help customers solve problems. We do it with innovative products and
technology.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 21As Doug said, we've chosen the second path where people come ﬁrst. For
merchants, that means the customer. As we choose products, we consider things like
quality, sustainability, the supply chain, including how the people who make our
items are treated. And of course, we give customers value for their money. We're
continually innovating to ensure our assortment meets and exceeds our customers'
expectations.
So beyond the staples you've come to rely on us for, we're expanding the range of
options. In grocery, for example, we're innovating to meet people's increasing desire
for products that are even more exciting in terms of ﬂavor, variety and natural
ingredients. More and more often, customers are looking to us for the latest in
fashion. So we're expanding our elevated brands. We're also bringing more style
and personalization to home decor and beauty.
And much of what we sell is made right here in the U.S. Did you know, currently, two-
thirds of Walmart's annual product spend is on items made, grown or assembled in
the U.S.? No? Our goal is to provide families with solutions to their busy lives. And
that means creating a great shopping experience.
Starting with our largest store, the one closest to you, the Walmart app. We're
investing to improve search and discoverability, and we're making exciting progress.
We have features like virtual try-on and view in your home that give customers more
ways to interact with our assortment and to buy with conﬁdence. Our app is also the
gateway to many essential services like auto care, pharmacy and ﬁnancial products.
Of course, we're continually enhancing that experience with new innovation.
We're going to do that again today with the announcement of a new feature, Shop
with Friends. Take a look.
(video playing)
Shop with Friends is just one more way we're creating an engaging and interactive
experience for our customers and for their friends. Our job is to save people money
and time. So let's talk about saving time and hassle. Anyone here in charge of
making sure your refrigerator is always stocked with your family's favorites? Anyone?
I see a few people. So do you wish you had someone to help you do that, sometimes
wish you had someone to help you out with that? I do. That's why I'm excited about
the next innovation that we're going to talk about. A few years ago, here on this
stage, we announced InHome delivery.
It was a ﬁrst-of-its-kind service that allows customers to have their groceries
delivered all the way into their homes and even further into their refrigerators.
Today we're announcing that we're taking that service a step further with a new
replenishment feature that we're currently building.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-09

Please welcome Whitney.
Hi, Whitney.
Hi, Latriece.
{BIO 18795654 <GO>}
Welcome.
Thank you.
{BIO 18795654 <GO>}
So I've mentioned a new service. Will you tell everybody how it works?
Yes. Well, like you said earlier, everything we do at Walmart is aimed at serving
customers and removing the pain points from everyday life, and that's how we
started, by asking them how we could help. They told us that weekly household
planning and remembering what to purchase is one of their most time-consuming
responsibilities. And people get frustrated when they forget something or realize
they don't have that one thing they need.
I can tell you from personal experience, even something as small as not having milk
can really wreck my morning, especially when I've got that critical ﬁrst cup of coﬀee
poured and then go for the milk and nothing.
{BIO 18795654 <GO>}
Yes. You're right. Things get oﬀ track real fast if that coﬀee routine isn't right.
You're right. The good news is we've solved that. Customers who are Walmart+
InHome members will soon have access to replenishment. It's a feature we're
building using AI to create a personalized replenishment algorithm. It learns aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-09

Whitney Pegdencustomer's purchase patterns to determine the perfect cadence to restock their
essentials.
So the long list of things you purchase frequently. Whether it's the ones you need
every week or the things you need every 17 days, they'll be there the moment you
open the fridge or pantry. And you didn't have to lift a ﬁnger.
{BIO 18795654 <GO>}
I love it. I love not lifting a ﬁnger. Do you -- can you tell us -- because I don't think it's
a subscription. Is that right?
Yes. You're right about that. It's not a subscription. You might use a subscription for
something predictable like dog food. Maybe you need a bag of that every month.
When you're trying to ﬁgure out how to replenish all your essentials, which is a
bigger list with diﬀerent items, each one with variable consumption rates, can get a
bit complicated.
For example, I know in my house, we consume a lot of yogurt, waﬄes, milk, some
other things. But how much? And what exactly are those other things. Our
replenishment service solves that. It personalized and adjusts based on your
changing needs.
Not only are we going to get you what you need. We're going to get it to you when
you need it and even where you need it, right to your refrigerator. So when you go
for the milk, instead of nothing, something.
{BIO 18795654 <GO>}
Something. Well, what if I change my mind or I'm out of town?
Yes. You can always remove items from your automated basket. If, say, you know
you'll be away for vacation and you don't want more milk showing up, that's on your
control. Bottom line, the entire shopping experience is automated from building the
basket to delivering to your refrigerator, whether that's in your kitchen or garage.
{BIO 18795654 <GO>}
That's pretty cool.
We think so.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-09

Thanks for all you're doing. I can't wait to see what you bring next year.

{BIO 18795654 <GO>}
All right. Thanks, Whitney. At Walmart, we love innovating to save people time just
like we love saving people money. We'll keep listening to our customers. We'll keep
building new capabilities, and we'll keep working to earn their trust.
For us, the only choice is to follow the second path, the path where people come
ﬁrst. Thank you.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Thanks, Latriece.
In most instances, we build our own tech. That's the case with Sam's Club
experience, Shop with Friends and InHome replenishment. We have more than
28,000 associates and tech roles around the world working to bring these
experiences to life. But we don't have a goal of building everything ourselves.
We can get more done with the right partners like Microsoft. One of our most recent
collaborations has been to bring generative AI to our associates. And now we're
bringing it to our customers. We've been improving our search capability and have
built generative AI into our Walmart app and website to deliver a helpful and
intuitive search and browsing experience. For example, let's say you're throwing a
party for next month's Super Bowl.
Previously, you might run numerous searches for chips, wings, drinks and a new 90-
inch television. In the new experience, you search once for something intuitive, and
the app shows you everything you might need. Our design puts the relevant product
categories across the top and serves up a curated list to the best items. We use large
language models, including from Azure OpenAI, along with our own models that are
retail and Walmart speciﬁc. It's our models and our data that they put the ﬁnishing
touches on this improved experience.
Our new search fundamentally changes the way customers engage with us. We
become a partner in accomplishing a broader goal like throwing a great party. The
new search is rolling out to our iOS users today and to all platforms this quarter. This
isn't the only work we're doing with Microsoft. We've been strategic partners for
many years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-09

it's absolutely -- it's my pleasure.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
And thanks for everything you've done to give advice to me and the company over
so many years. It's really appreciated. I know that our companies have some things in
common, and one of those things is that we believe technology should be put to use
to enrich people's lives.
Today we've been talking about this fork in the road. So when you think about
everything that's possible today, including the applications for generative AI, what
are you most excited about?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes. It's been a fascinating, I would say, 14 months, Doug. When I look back at even,
say, the 70-plus years of computing history, we've strived to achieve two things, I
would say, which one is to empower people with technology that's more intuitive,
easy to use, natural to use. And second is to put the power in people's hands so that
they can make sense of the world, right? So eﬀectively, what we have done is
increasing levels of digitization of people, places, things so that we can have more
insight and more predictive power.
And in both these cases, that intuitive user interface and the reasoning engine, we've
had a real breakthrough with this generative AI way. And it's -- the ﬁrst time I got
excited was maybe 18 months or so ago when I saw GitHub Copilot as a software
developer to be able to go into your editor and suddenly start saying, wow, I can
also write code now again. And taking the drudgery -- the thing that struck me was
taking the drudgery out, bringing the joy back to the craft of software engineering.
That was just an unbelievable moment for me personally. And since then, of course,
now when you think about search, you're not searching.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-09

Search of a solution.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
That's right. And now today, when I get a Word document or a spreadsheet because
of Copilot, it's like the expert who wrote the document or the expert who created the
spreadsheet is right there. The expert -- it's more -- in fact, right at Comdex in 1990 --
I was checking this up in my Copilot -- Bill ﬁrst talked about -- Bill Gates ﬁrst talked
about something called information at your ﬁngertips. What we now in 2024 have is
expertise at our ﬁngertips, and that's what's exciting for all of us.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Let me take advantage of the fact that you're here to get some free consulting
advice. You're not charging us for this, I don't think, at the moment. But you know our
company well. When you think about generative AI or other technologies, what
should we be doing to serve customers and associates better than we are now?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes. One of the things -- you and I talked about this perhaps last summer, which I was
so excited about because, one, the rate of diﬀusion, right, it's not like we're talking
about technology. You're already deploying some of this technology, shaping it with
your own sort of additive work that you're doing. But the place where you started,
you talked to me, I don't know if you remember this, but you said, hey, we are
putting this in the hands of our associates, the associate assistant. That's pretty -- like
that's the place.
At the end of the day, we all have people who work in our companies who are trying
to accomplish things for our customers, empowering them so that they can go on to
achieve big things. I think that's fantastic to see, right? So that's the phase where I
think real revolution starts. Then the second place is what you just talked about,
which is our customers, to be able to use some of this technology to transform, I
think, the ultimate customer experience. Why do I shop at Walmart is to accomplish
my thing -- intent and to be able to understand that intent and the day you can have
that.
That, I think, is a very powerful place. So I think starting with your associates and then
scaling to the customers is where I think a lot of this technology can be applied.

not just see incrementality as we have been seeing. And I hope that those of you that
are here and others will go try out this new search capability because it really is a lot
better. And thank you for your help with that. For all of us, everyone that's here and
watching, we're business leaders, technology leaders, and we're all facing this
question around generative AI, in particular, how do we put it to work for societal
good. And you can see things that we can't see. You're learning at a very fast pace.
As you stand here today, what advice would you give us all as it relates to that
question?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes. I think -- but all new technology, one has to be mindful that you want to be able
to amplify the opportunity with it and then also be very mindful of the unintended
consequences of this technology. But when we think about the opportunity, if you
take that metaphor I was using of putting expertise at your ﬁngertips, so when I see a
rural farmer in India able to use this technology to be able to get those subsidies
that they were looking for, where they're not just going and ﬁlling out forms but are
able to talk to a natural user interface that essentially does the job for them, right,
that's empowerment. When a physician, who wants to spend more time with the
patient at one of your clinics is able to do so because the AI is transcribing the entire
visit, ﬁlling out all the EMR data, doing all the billing, all the sort of paperwork is
being done by AI so that the doctor can focus on the patient, that's empowering.
When a student in any neighborhood now can get personalized tutoring, right, think
about it, 8 billion people in the planet can now have a personalized tutor for any
subject, anything that they want to learn, that's empowering.
Just this morning, in fact, one of the things we launched today, Doug, was we
worked with one of our national labs in the United States to discover new materials
that essentially remove 70% of the lithium required for new batteries, right? And to
me, that is just fantastic to create essentially new material science because if we think
about the planet, the challenge of sustainability of the energy transition, you have to
take 250 years of chemistry and compress it into 25 years. And so that's where I think
we have, as a society, as a global community of innovators, bringing some of this
technology and applying it to the challenges of people in planet is what I think you
are doing, we are doing, and I think everyone in the room has the opportunity to be
part of.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes. Well, I want to thank you for your thoughtfulness as it relates to that question in
the way that you approach this issue. And for those of you that don't get to talk to
Satya as much as I do, I can just tell you that he is being very deliberate and
thoughtful trying to shape things towards empowerment and good given these new
capabilities that can really literally change the world.

{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I just realized, we asked you to follow Satya Nadella. Congratulations. You're
welcome. As you know, technology is changing everything. It's changing the
experiences we're providing for customers.
It's changing how we do our business, isn't it?
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
Yes, absolutely. And in fact, that's the reason why this really is the most exciting time,
at least in my career, it's an exciting time to be leading the future of retail, and it's an
exciting time to be in technology, especially here at Walmart. Technology is driving a
fundamental shift across all of retail but particularly in three areas. First, discovery.
Now Latriece spoke about how customers are discovering new products.
I see this at my home. My daughters ﬁnd inspiration, sometimes a little bit too much
inspiration, on stuﬀ that they ﬁnd and they want to buy on social media. Second,
around purchase. Now Megan showed some of the ways in which we are innovating
around purchase. Customers adapt readily to more frictionless payment options.
Now as they grow more and more comfortable with new forms of transactions, we
are right there. We are ready for them. And then third is receive, right? So this is the
experience that customers have receiving goods, whether it is by delivery, by pickup,
InHome. The goods need to reach customers where they are and when they want
them.

Suresh KumarWell, we've shown some of the innovations that are impacting our customers already
here today, but there's a lot that's happening behind the scenes for us to become an
adaptive retailer.
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
Absolutely. See, as a retailer, shopping today is a combination of both online and oﬀ-
line experiences. But customers don't care about separate channels. Sometimes they
want to shop online. Sometimes those same customers, they will come into the store,
and we are bringing the very best aspects of all channels to delight customers no
matter how they like to shop.
This is adaptive retail, meaning that every engagement is interconnected. It's
frictionless, and it exceeds expectations. We are agile. We are predictive. We are
responsive.
We are not thinking separately about e-commerce or in-store. We are designing one
adaptive, seamless experience for the customer.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes. To enable what you just said, a lot has to change within our supply chain. So let's
spend a few minutes describing what's going on with the supply chain speciﬁcally.
When we ﬁrst started with general merchandise discount stores that sold items like
apparel and sporting goods, we built a distribution center network to support them.
Then in the '90s, we built a temperature-controlled perishable food distribution
network.
In the late '90s, we started our e-commerce business. So we've been building e-
commerce fulﬁllment centers to enable that business. We ended up with three
diﬀerent supply chains. So for a few years now, we've been working to link them.
We're building an intelligent connected and more automated network, one that
already moves more than 100 billion individual items every year.
And now we can do that in a smarter fashion. Suresh, I've been with this company for
a little over 30 years, and there's never been a period of transformational change in
our supply chain like the one that we've started. Please tell them more about it.
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
Yes. So Doug, the -- all the three systems that we had built, they work well
individually, but we had an opportunity to reimagine the entire system. To simplify
something that is so extremely complicated is never been done before, not at this
scale. So a modern supply chain requires built-in intelligence that can do two things.
Number one, it can forecast what customers want and when they want it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-09

Suresh KumarAnd number two, it can orchestrate the movement of very, very diﬀerent products
that need to be stored in very diﬀerent ways. Now forecasting customer demand,
this needs to happen very accurately obviously but far enough out for our suppliers
and near real-time on the customer end. So we built an industry-leading forecasting
system that is smart. It's automated, and it uses a patent-pending machine learning
model that predicts customer behavior, and it helps us accurately forecast how much
of a product is needed and where. Our models, they incorporate dozens of diﬀerent
types of data, like historical sales data but also things like weather forecast, the
overall popularity of an item compared with last year but also how an item is
trending on social media.
Now we also built artiﬁcial intelligence into how we orchestrate the optimal
movement of our inventory. The main job is to have the product where our
customers need it the most, right? This AI system also redistributes inventory
autonomously. So if the demand for an item spikes in one area of the country, our
automated system redistributes the merchandise within the network so that
customers can get it when they want it. So after the customer places an order, our AI
system predicts how long it will take based on several factors including how many
associates are there, how many drivers, what their distance to the home and what's
happening in real time, the traﬃc conditions.
So our artiﬁcial intelligence now looks at all these things at any time. Tells a
customer, I can do it in this amount of time. Now Doug, this is really important when
we are talking about things like fresh produce. My wife, she loves strawberries.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Me too.
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
But we only have very few days to move strawberries from ﬁeld all the way to the
table for peak freshness. So understanding demand for items like strawberries,
being able to deliver them at scale across the country, this requires a full breadth
and depth of our system, everything from infrastructure all the way to intelligence.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
You make it sound simpler than it really is, which is great. But creating a seamless
experience for customers can be pretty complicated.
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
Yes. So Doug, this is the power of technology that's working behind the scenes. And
by the way, it's only going to get better. Our connected supply chain, this is just the
beginning. To realize our vision for adaptive retail, we will see a lot more
interconnectedness between online and oﬀ-line consumer experiences, between ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-09

even with customer homes.
Technology has never been more fundamental to the retail industry. Our teams are
creating the future. Now the experience of the future will be even more seamless. It
will be even more delightful, more intelligent, more connected. Now from discover
to purchase to receive, at every step of the customer journey, our innovations help
us anticipate and help us react.
Doug we live in really exciting times. I'm impressed with the work that our
technologists are doing every single day to dream up and deliver on this amazing
experiences.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes. I'm really impressed, too, and I'm grateful to you and to your entire team for all
the work that's going on to move things forward in our company, Suresh. Thank you
so much.
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
Thank you.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Appreciate you. Now I want to introduce you to someone who joined us 13 years ago
and today leads automation and innovation for Walmart U.S. stores and supply chain,
Prathibha Rajashekhar.
Thanks, Doug. First, I want to expand on what Suresh said. Our supply chain is more
intelligent and connected by software and data. Think of it like an invisible layer, a
layer that digitally orchestrates where and how we move goods across the supply
chain. Our supply chain is also becoming more automated with autonomous robots
and storage and retrieval systems.
We have four types of systems that we're implementing in parallel: one for
perishable food, one for ambient products like apparel or toys, one for fulﬁlling e-
commerce orders, and one for fulﬁlling pickup and delivery orders located adjacent
to some of our stores. All of this automation helps us move more goods to our
buildings faster. It also means associates manage the technology and leave the
heavy lifting to automation. Implementing and connecting these four types of
automated storage and retrieval systems is a huge part of our supply chain
transformation, but it's not the only component. As Suresh said, demand forecasting
is becoming more advanced on the front end, and we are innovating all the way
through to the customer with the last mile of delivery.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 16 of 21Doug McMillonWhen it comes to delivery, our focus is on giving customers convenient and
aﬀordable delivery solutions that complements their busy lives. For example, if you
needed something delivered at four p.m. on a Tuesday, we can do that through
scheduled delivery. If you needed something delivered into your refrigerator, as
Whitney shared, we can do that through InHome; or if you needed to order
ingredients for dinner and it's six p.m., no problem. We can do that through Express
Delivery.
But what if you needed something delivered immediately as in within the next 15
minutes? For moments like that, we've been trialing drone delivery. Over the last two
years, we've operated 37 drone delivery hubs across seven states.
During that time, we've completed 20,000 customer deliveries, more than any other
retailer. And we've learned a lot about how customers use this service.
One customer shared with us that she was in the middle of making a pot of chili
when she realized she was out of chili powder. Drone delivery to the rescue. One
family in Texas was watching the Rangers game on their back patio. What goes well
with baseball? Hotdogs.
Like most fans, they didn't want to leave their home. Drone delivery to the rescue.
Did you know that 75% of the 120,000 items in a supercenter meet the size and
weight requirements for drone delivery? That means there's not a whole lot that you
can't have delivered with a drone.
Today we are sharing something that's never been done before.
We are bringing the convenience and immediacy of drone delivery to the majority of
homes in one of the largest U.S. metros, Dallas-Fort Worth.
By the end of next year, we plan to provide 75% of the DFW population access to
drone delivery. The delivery radius is up to 10 miles, and deliveries can be as fast as
10 minutes. This is a huge step forward for the industry.
It marks the ﬁrst time a U.S. retailer has oﬀered drone delivery to this many
households in a single market. The deliveries will be powered by our on-demand
drone delivery partners, Wing and Zipline. Both have their Part 135 certiﬁcation,
which means they're approved by the FAA to complete long-range deliveries by
drone. Drone delivery isn't a thing of the future.
It's here today. And like everything else we do, it's about one thing, serving the
customer. So if you're in the DFW area, we can't wait for you to try it.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Thank you, Prathibha. Well, we've shared a few tech-powered experiences today
designed by our associates to help people live a better life. Of course, we want toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-09

Page 17 of 21help people save money on quality merchandise. That's where our purpose starts
and what customers and members have relied on us for. And having the one-stop
shop of a supercenter within 10 miles of 90% of Americans helps people save time.
And with today's technology, we can save people even more time and create
additional convenient options, so we're doing that. But we also believe we can and
should help people live better beyond just saving time and money. We believe we
can do more. We want to help them be healthier and do more than sell fresh,
aﬀordable food and operate pharmacies. So we're exploring additional ways to help
provide care like operating health care clinics.
And we want to help people ﬁnd easy ways to save and build equity for the future,
so we're working to digitize the ﬁnancial services we've provided in store and more.
We also want to continue our work to strengthen communities. We do this by
creating direct and indirect jobs locally all over the world, by incentivizing our
associates to volunteer their time, by contributing to the tax base as one of the
largest corporate taxpayers, by investing in communities through our store remodels
and new builds, and by helping communities thrive and recover after natural
disasters. Extending beyond our local activities for many years now, we've been
aggressively working to become more sustainable. In the mid-2000s, we paused to
listen and learn, which led to a permanent mindset shift.
We began to see the entirety of the systems we were operating in. We learned that
becoming more sustainable strengthens our business. We set three big goals: to
create 0 waste, to be supplied by renewable energy and sell products that sustain
our resources and environment. We've made progress. We now divert 78% of our
waste from landﬁlls.
We're powered by 47% renewable energy, and we persistently work to eliminate or
improve packaging and make more sustainable products the everyday choice. 63%
of our global private brand packaging is now recyclable, reusable or compostable,
and we're working to be at 100% by the end of 2025. In 2020, we raised the stakes
with our aspiration to become a regenerative company. Regeneration means people,
places in the planet are all left better because we got involved, creating
opportunities for associates by paying for their college education. Working to
improve the planet through our goals to reach 0 emissions and waste, improving the
communities where we do business.
Ultimately, our goal is to build trust and to behave in ways that are consistent with
our values. Let us tell you about two big areas of our work. You'll hear from Donna
Morris, our Chief People Oﬃcer, who joined us in 2020 from Adobe. Donna not only
brings some fantastic digital and HR experience to our company, but she brings an
amazing heart for our associates. But ﬁrst, I've asked Vishal Kapadia, who has more
than a decade of experience in renewable energy and now leads our energy
strategy, to talk about our goals.

Thanks, Doug. At Walmart, we've been on a journey to reduce the impact of our
operations on the environment, and we've made tremendous progress. We're on
track to power more than 50% of our operations with renewable energy by 2025,
but we need to do more. So to start, we want to accelerate our journey to
decarbonize our operations and be powered by 100% clean energy well before our
2035 target. So we're signiﬁcantly expanding our portfolio of oﬀsite clean energy,
focusing on high-impact, high-quality projects that deliver the right outcomes in the
right places.
At our facilities, we'll be increasing deployment of clean energy on site with a plan to
install 1 gigawatt of new solar and storage by 2030. And that's just within our
operations. But we're also going to work to make clean energy accessible and
aﬀordable for our customers and members. One of the ways we'll do that is by
unlocking up to 2 gigawatts of new community solar projects around the U.S. These
projects will enable tens of thousands of households in the communities we serve to
access clean energy, all while delivering savings on their electricity bills.
In total, we'll help bring nearly 10 gigawatts of clean energy projects online by the
end of the decade, enough to power more than 2 million households in the U.S. And
in doing so, we'll help people save money and live better. Now shifting over to
electric vehicles. Last year, we announced our plan to deploy a nationwide network
of fast EV chargers across thousands of our stores and clubs by 2030. Using partner
technology, these chargers will be Walmart owned and operated so that we can use
best-in-class chargers and deliver a Walmart charging experience, one that is
convenient, reliable and aﬀordable.
And we'll be launching that experience with these new chargers later this year. Now
we recognize that we can't be tech-powered without power. But that power needs to
be reliable. It needs to be aﬀordable, and critically, it needs to be emissions free. So
we'll be committing signiﬁcant resources to take action and help build an energy
system where everyone has access to reliable, low-cost clean energy because an
energy system that does that, it beneﬁts everyone, our business, our customers and
members, our communities, and of course, our planet.
So we're going to do our part in this energy transition and help leave the world
better than we found it. And now to talk about how we're helping our associates live
better, our Chief People Oﬃcer, Donna Morris.
{BIO 16617461 <GO>}
Well, thank you very much, Vishal. It's great to be here. As Doug mentioned earlier,
this is a story about people. It's about the associates that built the technology that
you've seen today. It's about the merchants who buy the items, and it's about the
InHome delivery associate who places the carton of eggs exactly where you want
them because of the meaningful connection they have with you that cannot be
replaced by technology.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 19 of 21It's also a story about people and work that continues to change. It looks diﬀerent
than it might have a year ago. And these people are embracing change in the
service of our customers and our members, people and associates like Lisa. Let's
take a look. (video playing)
Lisa's story -- and I have to say Lisa is here as well. And her story is one that we see
across the company. It's a story of skills and jobs that continue to evolve.
Today in the United States, we have over 250,000 frontline associates that are
powering our online pickup and delivery business. That's 4x larger than we had in
2019 in this area of the business.
The roles, responsibilities and skills of our 2.1 million associates across the globe will
continue to change. They'll be leveraging technology but most importantly, our
humanity for impact. As customer expectations have changed, we've also
accelerated the digital journey for our own associates, and we built an app called
Me@Walmart. Me@Walmart gives our associates the ability to manage their
schedules, gain new skills that can assist them in moving across into roles in the
company and even make changes to personal beneﬁts, such as their 401(k) or a
stock purchase plan. The access to information for our associates improves their
experience.
As an example, we have more than 397,000 U.S. associates buying Walmart stock
through our purchase plan that's right in their hands. And we add 15% on top for
their ﬁrst $1,800 they put in every year. Me@Walmart also includes work-related tools
such as VizPick, which allows our associates to instantly map and track backroom
inventory. This augmented reality technology helps our associates ﬁnd, move and
manage store inventory in real time.
But it also captures important product data and provides predictive trends to inform
delivery. We're on a journey to combine nearly 300 disparate systems into
Me@Walmart, 300, one seamless digital platform. For our campus associates, this
includes My Assistant, which is powered by generative AI. It contributes to
productivity that includes supporting the creation of documents, calculations and
product specs. Since launching My Assistant late last year in the United States and in
Canada, we're super excited to be rolling it out to our associates in many other
locations, including Mexico, Central America, Chile, South Africa and India.
But to me, given I'm very much focused on our associates, the most exciting thing is
how we're providing a truly consumer-grade experience for our people, built by our
people, our associates. Most companies are focused ruthlessly on being great for
their customers as it relates to technology. And we love removing the friction from
the retail experience, but we believe it is essential to bring that exact same
experience to our very own people. We're building technology tools to help our
associates improve their jobs, enhance their experience for work today and to equip
them with the skills for the future, creating the opportunity to turn a job into a career.

to know that they belong at Walmart, our associates, our customers and our
members, everyone. Walmart is people led and more tech powered, but it'll always
be our people that make the diﬀerence. Now Doug, back to you.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Thank you, Donna. We've shared a lot with you today.
We announced some new innovations like an AI-powered exit experience at Sam's
Club, Shop with Friends, InHome replenishment, retail search powered by generative
AI and the expansion of drone delivery.
And we've shown you what the transformation of our supply chain means for the
movement of goods and the people who move them.
We announced that we're signiﬁcantly expanding our use of solar and making clean
energy more accessible and aﬀordable for tens of thousands of households.
And we shared that we're making My Assistant, our generative AI power tool,
available to more associates in more countries.
We started today talking about a decision that every business must make, the fork in
the road. We made our choice.
We choose to be a company that helps people live better, a company that uses
technology to serve people, not the other way around, that treats people with
dignity and creates opportunities for them to thrive. It leaves communities and
society better than we found them.
As we fulﬁll our potential, our people will continue to be living examples of servant
leadership. We're a company with not only the best of intentions but also a real
impact that even more tangibly improves people's lives. That's what we're working
to accomplish.
Today, we focused a lot on the technology that's powering adaptive retail, and we
describe the future of shopping.
But remember that this is a story about people who are learning and adapting to
make that future real.
We all have a choice to choose a future that puts people ﬁrst. If we keep doing that,
we can help people around the world live a better life. That's what we want to do.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-09
