All right. I think we're good to go. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to day two.
Thank you for being with us.
We are honored to have Microsoft with us this morning. I greatly appreciate Dave
O'Hara being with us. He is the CFO of the Application and Services Group for
Cloud and Enterprise. He's got a long title.
Too long a title. We need to clean it up.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
That means you're very busy, lots of responsibilities.
It could mean that.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
All right. Well thank you, again, for taking the time to be with us.
Sure.

Heather BelliniObviously, there's a large number of people in the room, a mix of generalists and
specialists. So maybe you could give us an overview of what falls under your
purview?
Sure. Can I jump with the obligatory safe harbor statement?
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Oh, yes. Sorry, yes, please do.
And I'll make it short, which is I may make some forward-looking statements during
the presentation. And everybody in the room can just refer to our SEC ﬁlings for the
latest on the risk factors associated with Microsoft.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
You just made them so happy.
I know it was -- (inaudible).
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
I would have read it for you. I'm sorry.
So that's okay. So a little bit about the domain or the businesses that we have in our
Group.
So the ﬁrst one is the Application Services Group. And you should of that, in terms of
product names, you can think of that as Oﬃce and Skype and MSN and Bing. It's the
Application Services Group, essentially the online and on-premise services that we
provide to our customers.
The next Group is Cloud and Enterprise, the C&E Group, which is the easiest way is
it's the old Server and Tools Group, for those that are familiar with Microsoft. Then,
the third one is Dynamics, which is also known as MBS internally. And so, that's the
collection of groups that my team helps manage.

Heather Bellini
Dave O'HaraOkay. Great. Very helpful.
If you look back at your go-to-market prior to Satya taking over the reins to now,
what have been the biggest changes?
Sure. Just a little bit about Satya, broadly. I mean, he certainly -- I've worked with
Satya for -- worked with a for Satya for about 15 years. So I knew him before he was
famous. And I would say the good news is Satya is largely the same Satya that he's
always been since the beginning.
I think there's a few things that are probably most notable. One -- excuse me. One is
just the -- from an employee perspective, I think employees really understand the
vision and where we're trying to go. And they understand the strategy. And they're
certainly loyal to Satya. They feel a connection to Satya, I think, as sort of a -- it's just a
very strong bond in employees.
So employees are invigorated there. Proud to come to work. They're happy to come
to work. I think there's a new level of -- or renewed level of energy. And so, that's all
goodness.
From a customer's perspective, you asked about go to market, I think Satya's made it
super clear that he wants to help customers be successful. And by using the tools
and the products that they want to use. And so, you see some of that in some of our
cross-platform work. And some of the initiatives that we've taken to help support
even other development environments.
And so, from a customer perspective, I think it's -- they just -- we're oﬀering a choice
is the best way to say it. And Satya is a lot of the driving force behind that.
I would just say the third thing, just at more of a personal level, it's Satya's constantly
challenging everybody's thinking. He challenges your mindset, challenges your
assumptions, challenges what I would call the status quo. And so, I think he's just
brought sort of a level of urgency and an outlook on life that just says we need to
constantly be evolving. We need to constantly be challenging the view of the
marketplace.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Oﬃce 365 has been wildly successful. I think you said on your last call over 9 million
home and personal users. What are -- how are you thinking about Oﬃce 365
changing the typical attach rates to PCs?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 18Heather Bellini
Dave O'HaraYes. When we think about Oﬃce 365 from both a consumer and an enterprise level,
we ﬁrst think about the value prop. And it -- if you look at the way that people used
to buy Oﬃce before, a lot of times, especially for the consumer, they would Oﬃce
when they bought a new PC. And as PCs became more durable and became -- had a
longer life, oftentimes somebody would buy a PC and not buy another ﬁne for ﬁve or
six years. And so, they're upgrading Oﬃce every ﬁve or six years, at least in the
consumer side.
And I think Oﬃce 365, we spent a lot of time on the value prop and on pricing and
how we think about taking that to market. And what we've seen from a consumer
perspective is they like the fact that it's constantly being innovated. So instead of
getting Oﬃce less frequently, they get constant innovation. And they like the fact that
it's an online oﬀering. And so we've seen -- we've seen what we consider to be really
good attach rates at the consumer level.
As you said, Heather, it's -- we shared on the earnings call last time that we have 9.2
million subscribers in the home and personal. So we feel good about the
momentum that we have. We also worked closely with our distribution partners to
make sure we get the value prop right, whether it's the retailers or the OEMs or any
of our distribution partners.
And so, through all of that, we've seen pretty good adoption and we feel good
about where we're at. But lots of room to grow and lots of work to do.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Okay. And if we ﬂip to the enterprise side for a second, you've also seen a lot of
success in terms of adoption of Oﬃce 365 in the ELAs is what we've heard a lot of.
How do you think about those ramps? So when we talk to customers, a lot of people
have gotten it as part of their ELAs. And they're slowly starting to adopt it, starting to
roll it out.
How do you see about the ramp for that occurring? And kind of what are the drivers
of getting people to actually start kicking in usage?
Sure. Sure, there's a few things on the commercial side One is, we talked about it in
the last earnings call, that as the -- of the EA agreements, as the enterprise
agreements are renewed 45% of those renewed is Oﬃce 365, which is a huge
number. And just by comparison, the quarter before that, that number was like a
third. So it was a big jump.
And so, we're seeing a pretty good sized jump in that. I think it's -- I think there's a
few things going on. One is, as you mentioned, enterprises are starting to adopt it.
But they don't -- it isn't necessarily a choice, a binary choice, where they do on-prem
or cloud. A lot of times, they'll just do Oﬃce 365 for a division or a group and get upFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

Dave O'Harato speed. And then they'll roll it out further. And so, I think we're seeing a good
transition and a good mix of online and on-premise being shifted to cloud.
I also think it's something that ﬁts very naturally into our sales motion. So our sales
team knows how to sell it. They know how to position it. And they know how to go
out and land those deals. And that's part of the acceleration.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
How do we think about the lifetime value of the customer, if they're already on
subscription, on an enterprise agreement where they're paying you on an annual
basis, they adopt Oﬃce 365, what's the potential for Microsoft to generate higher
lifetime value? Is it they're buying a higher-end Oﬃce SKU? Are they attaching other
things to it?
Walk us through how to think about, as people shift from the traditional ways they
support the software to moving to Oﬃce 365, what the opportunities are?
Sure. So lifetime value is the right way to think about. Let me talk about EA ﬁrst and
then maybe non-EA.
When you look at an EA customer, if they're moving from on-premise Oﬃce to Oﬃce
365, we do think there's an opportunity to up-sell. And we've seen that up-sell
showing up in some of our numbers in terms of the mix. So we think from an Oﬃce
perspective, we think there's a chance to up-sell.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
What is that sell, speciﬁcally, in that scenario?
Well there's -- if you look at our SKU mix, our hero SKU, as we call it, is Oﬃce 365
Premium. And Oﬃce 365 Premium is the one that the ﬁeld talks about the most. And
the one that the ﬁeld has the most success in landing. And so, a lot of times we'll see
an up-sell to Premium when we're out talking about 365 and on-prem.
So from an EA perspective, we do think there's an opportunity for an up-sell there.
There's also an opportunity to add in other products, like your enterprise mobility
suites, which we sell a -- which we sell as an add-on to 365. We're seeing really good
traction on that.
And so, we think that getting people to the cloud allows us to go out and sell more
cloud oﬀerings. So there's a transition which is, we give them a choice of on-prem orFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

Dave O'Harathe cloud. And then once we get them on the cloud, I think there's an opportunity to
up-sell.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And that's for your people, your customers already on an annuity --
That's for people already on an EA.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
It's not about the transactional people.
That's right. For those that aren't on an EA, for our non-annuity folks, whether they're
enterprise or consumer, again, we think the upside that previously they would
typically get a copy of Oﬃce when they bought a machine. And now they'll have a
perpetual copy of Oﬃce, which is stickier. And, over the lifetime value of that
customer, it oﬀers us a higher revenue opportunity.
It does come with higher COGS, obviously. But it -- the higher COGS on our side
results in lower cost to the customer. So it certainly increases the value prop. And
over the lifetime of that customer, there's higher absolute proﬁt dollars for us, as
well. And so, we feel like we're in a good position to take advantage of that.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And you mentioned Oﬃce 365 Premium as the SKU the sales force kind of goes
after the most. What are the top two or three features in that, that is resonating, that's
getting people to make that jump?
Sure. So from an Oﬃce 365 perspective, the broad -- let me talk a little bit about how
we think about the SKU, the business SKU. So we have the enterprise. We have the
Premium SKU. We also have the business SKUs at the lower end. So we spend a lot
of time thinking about the oﬀerings within speciﬁc SKUs.
And so, there are some people who want online if they can get basic online,
Business Essentials, as we call it, which is basically Oﬃce online with all of the
oﬀerings that go with that. You move up in the SKU. And then you have the Business
SKU, which is essentially fully installed Oﬃce. And we have that oﬀering for
businesses. Then we have the Premium SKU, which is essentially the combination of
the two.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

Dave O'HaraAnd we have those at various price points. The ﬁrst oﬀering is $5 per user per month.
The second oﬀering is $8.25 per user per month. And the third is $12.50 per user per
month, I think. And so, we step up through that. And there's a lot of people that want
that ﬂexibility of having the online version of having the online version or the
installed version.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Okay. Dropbox was here yesterday. And, obviously, you're at very diﬀerent realms of
business maturity. But they mentioned one of the most signiﬁcant partnerships
they've done to date has been with Microsoft and with Oﬃce. And I'm just -- if you
can just help us all understand the decision for Microsoft to partner with a company
like Dropbox, given, I mean, the millions and millions you already have using
OneDrive? How do we think about your decision to do that?
Sure. It's a good question. And not an easy decision to make. It goes back to what I
said at the beginning about Satya's focused on customers and oﬀering customers
choices. Dropbox has done a great job of growing and getting penetration in the
same customers that are using Oﬃce 365. And we thought that it was important to
oﬀer them choice.
The one -- the other thing I would about the Dropbox partnership, because we do
consider it important and strategic for us, is it's not sort of -- it's not a marketing
announcement. It's a genuine partnership where we have our development teams
collaborating and making the integration as seamless as possible. We want that to
really work. And work well, in a customer environment. And so we spent -- we spend
the time and money to get that right.
And so, that Dropbox partnership is a deep partnership. We do oﬀer OneDrive.
OneDrive is growing like crazy, as well. And so, we feel good about our OneDrive
oﬀering. But there are customers out there who use Dropbox and don't do -- don't
use OneDrive. And we wanted to be able to reach all of those customers.
So for us, it was more about the partnership and what customers wanted. And less
about the competition. We still have OneDrive and Dropbox both out selling in the
marketplace. And that'll continue for a long, long time. So, we felt it was better to
oﬀer a choice.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Okay. Great.
And you'll see that theme throughout a lot of the moves that Microsoft is making
today.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

Okay. I was going to shift gears a little bit. And talk about Azure. And I was just
wondering if you could help, for everyone here, just kind of compare and contrast
Azure versus AWS and Google Compute, or the Google cloud, in general?
Sure. so, from an Azure perspective, that's obviously a super-competitive space. It's
important for us to play there. And I sense -- there aren't too many companies on the
planet who can play well in that space.
And so, we made a lot of investments in Azure. And I think that even some of the
surveys that have come out recently have shown that Azure customer satisfaction
continues to grow. We continue to get market penetration. People see it -- while we
gave our competitors a head start, I think we're doing a really good job of catching
up with Azure.
And so, we feel really good about where the stack is. You'll see a lot of the same
things in Azure, as well, which is, we've forged partnerships with the important
companies. I mean, it's not -- you're not required to run SQL, as an example. We
support a multiple -- we support multiple databases through Azure. And so, we want
to -- we announced our deal with Docker, as another example.
And so, we think it's -- not only do we need to have the toolset to keep up, we need
to support multiple development environments. And multiple partnerships in that, as
well. And I think that's we are seeing good traction with it.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And where do you see -- if you're sitting down with Satya and he is asking you to go
through kind of an overview of the competitive landscape, how do you look at those
other cloud providers. And see where you need to catch up, or where you feel you're
ahead? Can you share with us kind of in both -- on both spectrums?
Sure. So Scott Guthrie talks -- Scott Guthrie is the person who leads Cloud and
Enterprise for Microsoft. Scott likes to talk about Azure competes in a -- there's a few
things we need to do to really compete in the cloud. One is we need hyperscale.
And hyperscale is, to say the least, expensive. But it's very important. And so, people
need to have the wherewithal, ﬁnancially. And also the mindset to say we're going to
invest and we're going to compete. So Scott likes to talk about how do we think
about hyperscale. And we think we're one of the few companies out there that can
really do that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 18Heather Bellini
Dave O'HaraThe second thing that I already alluded to is just hybrid in terms of supporting
multiple development environments, supporting multiple databases, supporting
whatever toolsets that the users want to use. And hybrid is -- hybrid is deep. That's
been -- we've made moves in that in the last year or two to really get us into a hybrid
environment. And we've made a couple of acquisitions that we've announced that
we think can help support other development environments. And so, hybrid is the
second piece that is important.
Then, the third piece is what Microsoft, I think, does super well, which is enterprise.
And enterprise stability and security.
And so, we bring all of those to the cloud oﬀering. I just think when you look at the
number of companies across the planet that could do that, there aren't very many.
Certainly Amazon and Google are among those. But we feel like Microsoft is pretty
well positioned to capture that.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Well and it -- if you look at it, there's obviously the infrastructure as a service market
you're going after, the platform as a service market. Is there an inherent advantage
that Microsoft, versus those other two players, because you have database
applications. And you've got mail applications that you've built and own yourself that
are already in wide use, where infrastructure people worry it's kind of a race to zero
in terms of pricing? But where you'll be able to really beneﬁt is having, maybe,
higher PaaS share, just given your existing footprint?
Yes. That's a really good point. I would even expand on that a little. And I would say
there's a few things that we work in our favor. One is, we have relationships with all
those companies. I mean, we already have sales people in those accounts. They're
using our products, as you point out. And we think that's helpful.
We also know we need to earn the business. So as we look at that, we're continuing
to develop those products.
So I think it's -- and then the third piece, which you also touched on, which is I ﬁrmly
believe that when you look at tech companies across the planet, if you look at all of
the assets Microsoft has, we have a very strong base of assets to build on. And so,
we're seeing that. And I think that it's hard to ﬁnd a company that brings more assets
to market from a technology perspective than Microsoft does.
But we still feel like we have to earn that business every day. And so, I think those are
all things that are goodness for us and work in our favor. But by no means does that
make it -- sort of does that make it a layup. We still have to work hard to win those
customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

We were just -- Red Hat had an earlier session. And one of the things that came up
was people talking about kind of what's been done on the security front over the last
12 months to get people more comfortable with cloud adoption. And whether it's
who gets to hold the encryption keys. Can you talk a little bit about how people are
becoming increasingly more comfortable with security aspects of moving stuﬀ
through a public cloud?
Yes. That's been, certainly, an evolution. I think even a few years ago, it would have
never been foreseen that people would be willing to do that. But I think security has
improved. I think people have just gotten more used to the environment.
I think that CIOs have understand that there's cost beneﬁts to storing things in the
cloud. But it's always a bit of a tradeoﬀ, which is they see the goodness in it. They just
needed to be comfortable that we were going to take care of their data. And I think
that -- Microsoft has a strong reputation for taking care of customer data. And so, it
seems -- sometimes it seems like it ﬂipped overnight. It didn't really ﬂip overnight for
those of us that have been investing in the cloud for years and years and years. It
took a long time to get here.
And now I feel like we can -- we have the tools. And we have the software. And we
have the conﬁdence of the CIOs to make those investments. But it's been a long
time coming.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Okay. Being the CFO of a Group where you're trying to compete with two other
really big heavyweights that have a lot of ﬁnancial wherewithal, trying to do
hyperscale. And dealing with a pricing environment that you have in Azure, for
example, with competitive moves, how do you do that and keep Amy happy?
Keep Amy happy? I would say this, that we -- for us it's -- as you mentioned, it's both
infrastructure as a service, platform as a service. And also the apps that are built on
top of that. And we think that core infrastructure is, obviously, very important to be
able to meet customer needs. But the real value add is when you can get into the
apps that run on top and you have -- you just have better margins inherently built in.
And so, if you look at 365, as an example, if you look at CRM Online, as an example,
both of those are oﬀerings that are built on top and will have better margins over the
life of the customer.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

Heather BelliniAnd so, we do think there's always that layer, that sort of infrastructure layer that
maybe will -- where pricing will be more under pressure. But we feel like as long as
we keep adding apps on top of that, the margin mix will be there.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Okay. Bing -- another area in your domain that I think it was mentioned on one of the
last couple of calls that this segment would be proﬁtable in ﬁscal '16. How do you get
there? Is it a combination of revenue and continued cost cuts? I mean, you guys have
been very good at kind of reducing the cost of that business. You've got some
market share gains, as well, continued market share gains.
How do you think about that, the dynamic between both of those, revenue growth
and cost, being a factor in getting there?
Sure. So a little bit on Bing. I mean, it's exactly what you said, which is it's a scale
game. And we've increased our market share signiﬁcantly. I think our most -- the
most recent US market share had us at 19.7% share on Bing.
And so, it is a little bit about scale. It's a little bit about building the conﬁdence in the
advertisers to spend on the platform. And it's taken us a while to get there. But that
shows up in the revenue per search, which has been going up consistently for the
last several years. Our search revenue grew 23%, I think, Q2. And we -- so. And the
search revenue growth is both a combination of the increase in volume. And the
increase in the revenue per search.
We do a really good job of managing costs. But we also understand there that we're
investing for the long haul. And we need the basic underlying platform to work.
So what you'll see is, what we will see is continued revenue growth, some continued
user growth. And continued cost management. And that all gives us the conﬁdence
that we're going to be running a proﬁtable search business in FY '16.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Mobile -- the transition to mobile's been -- I mean, it's a positive for Google. But it's
also a headwind in terms of the type of CPC you can get. How do we -- walk us
through the mobile -- Bing mobile strategy.
Yes. The Bing mobile strategy. Obviously, we have -- there's Bing on Microsoft
mobile devices.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 12 of 18Dave O'Hara

Dave O'Hara
Heather Bellini
Dave O'HaraRight.
That's an obvious one. We also forge partnerships, as needed. We have the Yahoo
partnership which everybody knows a lot about.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Yes.
We have a partnership with Amazon where we have Bing on Kindle devices. We have
a partnership with Apple where Bing powers the back end Siri searches.
And so, it -- so you need -- we need to be good on our own devices. We need to be
good on -- we need to be good in our partnerships. And we also need to be good in
the future. And so, you'll see Windows 10, we're doing more work than ever. And
better work than ever to make sure that Bing is embedded in sort of all the Microsoft
fabric and the Microsoft oﬀerings.
And so, I think the combination of all those things will help us continue to grow. I --
to your point of mobile search is a very diﬀerent business. It has diﬀerent pricing.
And diﬀerent economics. But we really see that as augmenting our existing business.
And so, we see it as additive.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right. Mindy, when she was still at the Company, gosh, probably, I don't know,
maybe it was three or four years ago, talked about it wouldn't have made sense for
Bing to bid on the Apple iOS search agreement, predominantly because what you
would have had to have paid out would have cost you more than the revenue you
were taking in, given revenue per search wasn't there.
A lot has changed since then. Revenue per search has obviously gone up quite a bit.
Does that change when you guys -- does your view change now when you think
about being able to get those types of big partnerships?
Well those big partnerships, always -- there's a bit of nuance to them, as well as
science. And so, from our perspective, we -- we still need deals that make economic
sense. We just do. And we're not in the business of doing underwater search deals.
And so, we will do whatever deals make economic sense for us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

Dave O'HaraI think that when you look at a partnership like that, using Apple as an example, you
would have to say, okay what impact does the deal itself have. And then what impact
does it have on our existing economics? For example, doing a deal with Apple, does
that increase your own revenue per search?
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right.
And so, there's a broader conversation around the economics that needs to happen.
But I would just say we're very grounded in doing distribution deals that make
economic sense.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
How do you try and determine the increase in share you might get as a result of
deals like that? When you're evaluating any deal, how do you think about that?
It's a little bit of science and a little bit of art. And you're doing it and saying, what
impact do we think that will have and why. And what impact does it have on traﬃc
and bit density and how do we think about pricing?
And so, it's really just having people who have worked on the business for years and
years, smart people who I trust implicitly to come in with their best judgment and
say, here's what we think the impact will be. And usually you're going to -- you can
peg it to a range. You're not going to get it exactly right. But you can have a general
sense of where it's going to come out.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right. So if there is a Windows plus Bing SKU, right, that's relatively new for sub-$250
machines, how -- to the extent -- and I don't know if you've had enough time in the
market with some of these to see. But the key to those for a lot of people will be on
what percentage of people actually change the default search from Bing to
something else. Is there anything you can share with us to date, based on what
you've seen?
We haven't -- it's early days. So I would say we -- our data is still coming in. We
haven't released any data on that yet. But again, we think of it as a longer-term
strategy. The Windows with Bing SKU is sort of the ﬁrst step. We'll see more with
Windows 10. And we just really feel like Bing is doing a -- we're going to do a better
job of integrating Bing in all the Microsoft experiences.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

I want to pause for a second and see is there any questions in the audience?
Questions And Answers
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Quiet group this morning. Okay, I wanted to switch to ad tech. How do you feel
Microsoft positions in ad tech?
Microsoft's position in ad tech. Well I would say -- there's -- in ad tech, there's always
been this debate about where is the power? Is it with the publishers? Is it with the
demand side? How do we think about it?
I would just say that Microsoft, by virtue of our position in software and in online, is
one of the biggest publishers on the planet. So we feel like we're well positioned as
a publisher in ad tech.
We've done, I think, a decent job of monetizing our -- of monetizing that position.
We can do a better job of monetizing that position. So I feel like, as a large publisher,
we have the opportunity to grow our ad tech business even more.
We do see ad tech as just part of the bigger puzzle. I mentioned earlier that we have
a -- what I would consider a bevy of assets. And I think that's true. And we just need
to come up with an ad tech strategy that capitalizes on that with that -- within the
broader Microsoft strategy.
So we feel good about where we're at in ad. We feel good about our progress in
search. And we feel good about our opportunity to monetize as a publisher.

Okay. Satya has said that he wants Microsoft to be relevant to dual users, right. And I
believe he said people who use technology for work or school. And how it impacts
their digital lives. How does that feed into the investment that you're making,
investment for acquisitions?
Sure, good question. So dual users. Dual users implies that we need to be -- it goes
back to the same theme, which is, that implies that we need to be good on other
people's devices, as well as our own.
And so, we've done some things to make that happen. Probably the most notable
that people have seen recently is our acquisition of Accompli, which resulted in theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

about. And we feel good about Accompli as an example of a good acquisition we
can do that leverages our existing position already. And builds on it.
And so, that would be an example of how we are looking to be dual user across both
home and work. And what that -- how that might show up. So I would say Accompli is
a good example. And there are other examples out there that we'll continue to
pursue.

How does Mojang ﬁt in?
How does Mojang ﬁt in?
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Yes.
Mojang ﬁts in because driving -- I would say, ﬁrst of all, not my area of expertise. But I
would explain -- because Windows is outside of my domain -- but I would just say it
this way. The Mojang acquisition was about driving deeper usage of Windows. And
making Windows more interesting to a targeted group of Windows users,
speciﬁcally gamers.
And so, I think that that is another example of where you can take something that -- a
broad product and make it more vertical. And I think any time you can make
products more vertical and more speciﬁc, it probably gives you a little more -- it
gives you an ability to get better and deeper margins.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Okay. I wanted to make sure we touched on Skype, given that falls under your
domain. There's applications, obviously, Messenger, there's WhatsApp, there's LINE.
How does Skype ﬁt into this kind of evolving category?
Yes --

A - Dave O'HaraYes, I mean, talk about a competitive space, that's -- communications is a super,
hyper-competitive space. I think Skype -- the Skype acquisition has been good for us.
It's taught us a lot about communications as a category. And we've learned a lot
from that.
If you look at what we're doing with Skype for Business -- it used to be called Lync -- I
think that's leveraging a lot of the learnings that we got out of Skype. So the Skype
acquisition has been helpful in that way. And then it helps us think about
communications, more broadly. But, again, super-competitive space.
And I think it -- we need to continue to innovate. I think messaging is an important
part of that. And so -- but it's only one part of it. We really think about
communications more broadly.
We also need to continue to innovate in that space. If you look at some of the things
we're doing with Skype translator, I think that's an example of where we can do some
things to continue to signiﬁcantly add value.
I would also just say the Skype brand has a lot of value within communications, as
well. And we just need to build on that brand.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And when you think of kind of WhatsApp being able to get to, I don't know, maybe
it's over 700 million users now are able to get online, what are the stats on Skype
usage?
I'm going to look at my IR guy. I don't think we've disclosed those recently. Skype -- if
you go back and track -- if you go back and track in time, Skype has had historically
hundreds of millions of users. And Skype continues to have hundreds of millions of
users. But I don't think we break that out separately.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Okay. And when you think about pivoting, I mean, none of these guys, really, have
ﬁgured out how to monetize these businesses yet. Can you kind of -- how do you
think about leveraging the existing portfolio of Microsoft assets to enable you to
leverage this, either directly or indirectly?
Right. Well I think the key -- the key for that is really to get the products to work well
together. And to be able to, quote/unquote cross-sell and up-sell. I say
"quote/unquote" because sometimes you just aren't able to price it. So just to get
them to work together and to use -- and to function well together and get users
using more than one product is super helpful.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

A - Heather BelliniI do think we have sort of an increased focus on post-sale monetization, how do we
think about that. A lot of that is largely through advertising. Some of it's through
subscriptions. And so, we're focusing on, one, is getting the products to work well
together and to cross reference across those products. And then a deeper focus on
wholesale monetization.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
I'm going to check for the audience one last time before we wrap it up. We've got
about two minutes left.
All right.
You're (inaudible) exactly the same response my team has when I do a Q&A with
them. So it's all (inaudible).
(technical diﬃculty).
So I'll just repeat the question. Does Bing distinguish itself in any way, or is it a
diﬀerent ﬂavor of ice cream?
So one is there's a core oﬀering you need to do in search. The algorithm -- the
results need to make sense, right? And so, we've spent a lot of time just making sure
that we have good curation.
And so, in some ways, you could argue, hey, it's search, search is search, right? We
try to diﬀerentiate it a little bit, both in the user experience and we also try to
diﬀerentiate in terms of, it's a small point. But even like the presentation of the search
where we have a photo instead of a blank white page.
And so, I think, really, it's a lot the same with nuanced diﬀerences is how I'd probably
describe it. So we invest heavily in the platform to try to create some diﬀerentiation.

Thank you. So much.
All right. Thank you, everybody.
