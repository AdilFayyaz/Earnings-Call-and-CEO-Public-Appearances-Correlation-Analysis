Okay. So good morning, everyone. Happy New Year. Welcome to JPMorgan's 18th
Annual Technology & Automotive Investor Forum here at the Consumer Electronic
Show. For those of you that don't know me, my name is Harlan Sur. I'm the
semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment analyst for the ﬁrm. Very
pleased to have a solid day of semiconductor, automotive, automotive technology,
general tech companies presenting. Also joining me here from JPMorgan are some
of my colleagues. I have got Bill Peterson, who covers the RF semiconductor value
chain. I've got my colleagues, Ryan Brinkman and Jose Asumendi, who cover the US
and European automotive sectors. Paul Coster, our applied and emerging
technologies analyst and Samik Chatterjee, who covers our IT Hardware and
Telecom and Networking Equipment sectors.
We continue to expand the companies that participate at our conference. And for
the ﬁrst time at our CES conference this year, we have management teams from
Microchip, Qualcomm, Xilinx, Cree, Gentherm, Gentex and Lear. So we hope you
enjoy the conference. Remember this conference is for you guys. So ask questions.
We've got a great lineup of companies. And with that, very pleased to introduce
Colette Kress, the Chief Financial Oﬃcer of NVIDIA. It's been a tradition now for the
past I think 5 years or 6 years now that the NVIDIA team kicks oﬀ our investor
conference, because the team is driving much of the trends that you will hear about
today, artiﬁcial intelligence and deep learning, next generation compute
architectures and automotive, next generation gaming technology, just to name a
few of the things. I've asked Colette to kick us oﬀ with an overview of what the team
is showcasing here at CES or maybe GTC, the meet -- the recent GTC in Shanghai
and then, we'll go ahead and kick oﬀ the Q&A. So with that Colette, thank you again
for joining us this morning.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Great. Thank you, Harlan for the introduction. And we're excited to be here and be
your pick-oﬀ. And I think, I'm going on 6 years to 7 years actually. So I think, we'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-01-07

Page 2 of 11forgetting on how many times we've been here, but we've seen a great acceleration.
As you know, we are an accelerated computing company. Our focus is in many
diﬀerent markets. And let me talk about some of the highlights that we have seen.
Starting ﬁrst with gaming, which I think is a great place to start, since we are here at
the Consumer Electronic Show. Our gaming business is doing quite well. Our
introduction of RTx which has been in the market for more than a year is oﬀ to a
great start. We have more than a couple dozen games in the market today, focused
on overall ray tracing. Ray tracing is what we believe the next wave of overall high-
end graphics and high-end graphics that can be used for gaming but a lot of other
diﬀerent places.
We're here introducing at CES more laptops and notebooks focused on the overall
RTx capabilities but also our overall Max-Q. You will probably see here, we have now
reached a total of more than a 140 laptops focused on gaming, focused on RTx that
you will see new ones even here today. We've talked about our overall cloud gaming
and our introduction of cloud gaming with many of our partnerships with the overall
telcos and our GTC in China in December, we announced another partnership with
Tencent bringing overall cloud gaming to an important market there in overall China.
We're also here at CES announcing a new form of our overall G-SYNC, which is
exclusive with many of the overall LG monitors that you're out there. It brings a
higher overall hertz or about 360 hertz to overall playing games in a very
competitive environment such as overall eSports. We know that eSports is again a
very important part of what we see in terms of gaming around the world and it was
taken oﬀ to on great, great strides.
Additionally, focusing on not only our overall gaming business but focusing on
accelerated computing in terms of what this means in terms of the data center. We
have announced a great acceleration of what we're seeing right now, both in the
overall hyperscales, increasing their overall purchasing and a lot of that has been
fueled by a very important industry of conversational AI with the underpinnings of
natural language processing. Recommendation engines are also very key. So we are
oﬀ to really focus with our TensorRT overall software and are inferencing to inﬂuence
a big part of this overall growing market. We also focused in China GTC, we focused
on overall edge computing. So our EGX overall platform which we will focus on our
probably next cloud platform. We've seen some major wins when we think about the
edge, focusing on companies such as Walmart, as well as the US Postal Service that
is using our overall platform to help in many of those areas of either warehouse
management or just focused on in terms of the overall supply and demand
management that we see.
Moving forward in terms of key area in terms of automotive, over in China, we
announced in terms of our DRIVE platform with DD [ph]. But we also announced our
overall next generation architecture Orin, which is probably 7x faster than our current
overall architecture focused on Xavier. These are platforms that are both available for
-- work with the overall automotives today and we have one of the true end to end
platforms focused on automotive that takes everybody, all the way from the
datacenter and focusing on training, simulation of the data for later for it to be inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-01-07

Colette Kressterms of production inside of the car. We've had a lot of other great announcements
that you'll see here, but I'll just start there with a quick summary.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
No, thanks for the great introduction. You know, it's well what a diﬀerence a year
makes. Last year, at this time, we were talking about crypto inventories, we were
talking about the slowdown in the data center business, you entered calendar year
'19 with your business down about 30% year-over-year. If you hit your guidance for
this quarter, you will actually exited calendar year '19 at plus 30% year-over-year.
Consensus has you guys up 20% in calendar year '20 which is your ﬁscal '21. Help us
understand the trends and product cycles that are going to drive this ﬁscal year,
ﬁscal '21 and longer term, how should we think about the overall growth proﬁle for
the diﬀerent businesses gaming, data center, ProViz and automotive.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
In the perspective of overall gaming, we're very, very well positioned. We have, as
we always do a full-lineup that allows gaming at a lot of diﬀerent overall price points.
We are the provider now that is focusing on overall ray tracing. First to overall market
and being end-market for a year and also even upgrading what we had in terms of
our existing Turing RTx cards to incorporate our overall Soopers [ph]. We went into
the overall holiday season knowing that this would be a great holiday seasons for the
games that were coming out, you will see in terms of games such as Call of Duty and
Wolfenstein also coming to market using our overall ray tracing capabilities. So as
we move forward, we are setting the way for ray tracing to take us through the next
generation of gaming, but not only focus just on the overall desktop. As you know,
we're bringing ray tracing to the overall notebooks. Opening up a market of
probably untouched of the mobility of overall gaming at a high-end overall
performance incorporating our overall Max-Q.
And then lastly, we know that the world of cloud gaming is an important area still in
its overall infancy. But we are the best to bring that to market with many of the
diﬀerent telcos and what many of the overall partnerships that can overall focus. So
we will continue to see the importance of gaming as an entertainment overall
industry as well as our platform being leading edge. Now when we focus in terms of
on data center. Data center and its opportunity, we're probably approaching a new
wave of overall AI. If you went back to the early 2012 time frame, that was a time
frame that people were bringing to market, the use of GPUs for overall image
detection, image categorization and actually quite excited about it because it did
change a lot of key apps.
What we have seen as early as the overall summer time is the evolving of natural
language processing with Google and its blog in terms of its overall BERT model in
showing people how they are using a technique to better understand how search
commands are created and how better to solve this, is an important expansion of
both natural language processing, not only for the overall hyperscales but for start-
ups, for consumer Internet companies, but also many of the overall enterprises.
You've seen now a wave of focus on conversational AI and we're only just beginning.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-01-07
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 11Harlan Sur
Colette KressThis is something that probably takes a 100x more computing performance than
what we have seen in overall history. It's a focus of not only on the training, but also
on the overall inferencing side.
You've seen our growth in terms of inferencing. Inferencing is now solidly within the
double digits as a percentage of our overall data center business, but you also have
a case, where we are shipping more overall inferencing cards than what we are seen
in terms of overall training. So we have a great path going forward, not only with
conversational AI but the recommendation engines broadly overall using GPUs.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
So let's stick with the datacenter, it's roughly a quarter of your overall revenues. You
will be exiting this year, as you mentioned with the business trending back to kind of
30% year-over-year growth rates after a three quarter pause by cloud hyperscale
enterprise customers. We had anticipated this business coming back in the second
half of 2019 as your cloud and hyperscale customers started their next wave of the
spending cycle. But with the NVIDIA team, as you mentioned, it's more than just
spending re-acceleration, what is this new wave of AI, their new applications like
natural language, conversational AI, you've got the ramp of your inferencing
business, this emerging business in edge computing. Can you just talk about all
three of these dynamics and the sustainability of 20%, 30% type year-over-year
growth rates, through calendar year '20 as well as beyond that.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So what we had talked about with our Q3 results is we did start to see the
improvement in terms of the overall purchasing of the overall hyperscales. As we
had focused earlier on the year, many of our engineering engagements we knew
were intact and we knew, we would get to the point, host the overall digestion to
focus on overall new compute. We see the hiring continue in many of these areas,
hiring in terms of the engineers at the hyperscales. You see the overall AI papers and
you see a tremendous amount of start-ups focusing on AI. So sure enough in the
second half of the year, we have started to see the comeback of the overall
hyperscales.
Now, the return of the hyperscales is not just focused on overall internal use. The
overall need for the overall cloud computing for those that don't have the
capabilities to build out their older [ph] infrastructure. It allows that opportunity for
them to begin their work in the cloud, they may remain in the overall cloud, but
we're seeing both of those. We are seeing in terms of our overall inferencing
platform, our T4, to be used worldwide. Worldwide and is actually in almost all of the
diﬀerent data center locations in terms of within AWS. And I think with the other
hyperscales, we will slowly start to see that also happen but we have broad-based
adoption of using the overall GPUs for inferencing. This is an important moment of
something that we knew, we were working on an incumbent, a CPU or a traditional
type of overall inferencing that a CPU is just ﬁne.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-01-07

Page 5 of 11Harlan Sur

Colette Kress
Harlan SurWhat we're seeing in terms of the future of inferencing is the complexity, the
complexity that natural language processing requires, the complexity of the amount
of data that needs to be mind over a short amount of period of time and a return in a
couple 100 milliseconds will require a GPU or a high performance overall processor
to do that. So we're very well positioned, positioned not only on the training, but
also on the inferencing side.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
The ﬁrst wave of AI adoption with your strong product cycle was image classiﬁcation
and recognition and classiﬁcation and this droves three strong consecutive years of
growth for your data center business given as you mentioned, the order of
magnitude, compute and training complexity required for some of these natural
language conversational AI models and on top of that the requirements for real-time
inferencing does -- this conversational AI have the potential to again drive a multi-
year kind of strong growth cycle for NVIDIA's data center business?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We do believe conversational AI is the next very large wave of overall growth that we
can see going forward. We're in the early stages of conversational AI both
understanding the use cases for it, but also the complexity that still has to add more
things to it, for example, we're really focused right now on a single language, we're
focused either on overall English or in some of the overall international, but there is
still a large piece to focus in terms of that translation and that overall processing.
So looking at conversational AI and the use cases, it's not just capable for overall
hyperscales. You see an opportunity of moving this to the enterprises everything in
terms of focusing on their call center, focus on that ﬁrst dialog that you have in terms
of communication and using AI to streamline the overall work that they do.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
On the inferencing side, you've had big success with your T4 inferencing platform.
Inferencing is now double-digits percentage of your overall data center business,
now that you've had time to understand this market and looking out over the next
few years. Do you think that your inferencing business can approach or even exceed
the size of your training [ph] business over the next kind of 3 years to 5 years?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So inferencing, we do believe is probably a larger market than what we have in
terms of the other pieces. So we are continuing to concentrate on this. Inferencing in
the overall data center is important, but remember also inferencing at the edge.

Inferencing edge computing but also edge in terms of autonomous devices will be
very key.
You've seen us focus not only on the processor for those diﬀerent capabilities but
also the software stack, one of our focus areas in the last six months, the last nine
months is unique overall software packages that really address the industry's overall
applications that are out there, you see us focused in terms of Clara, Clara is our
software capabilities and focusing on overall healthcare. Metropolis. Metropolis is
our overall software platform to deal with in terms of the places of the world that you
may be not just focused on cities, but anything inside of a building or otherwise. You
see us focused on Isaac. Isaac is focused on our overall robotics platform and
thinking about the autonomous piece. You can also of course think about our overall
DRIVE platform.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
That's right.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Our DRIVE platform is focused in terms of automotive. Each and every single one of
them is important to inﬂuence the acceleration, not just in the data center, but in the
edge and what is required to help that is the connection with the overall application
and that is our work that we've really been focusing on.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
You rolled out another vector of the product platform, which you've mentioned
several times, it's your EGX platform. Can you just talk about this. It seems like it's
more of a data analytics platform that's GPU accelerated versus an AI-based
platform, but this type of analytics has wide applicability across a number of diﬀerent
verticals. Can you maybe just help us compare, contrast your edge computing
platform versus your cloud and data center platforms?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. It is a form of thinking about what is necessary at the overall edge to focus in
terms of a cloud that doesn't have the capabilities to allow for it to go all the way
back to the cloud in terms of that overall functioning. So you're looking for a form of
computing that either is needed in the milliseconds to respond and or incorporates
overall data that is conﬁdential in nature that you don't want back in terms of the
overall cloud. So these are some of the things that we may see in terms of
healthcare, in terms of devices, scanning devices or otherwise, that you could do the
overall scanning and have the results in instantaneous amounts of time rather than
what we have seen in the past of that entire industry.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-01-07

Page 7 of 11Harlan Sur
Colette KressIn terms of what we see already in use of end-store capabilities. And what you see
inside of the stores in terms of both check out, you can look at the US Postal Service
in the same manner. How quickly can I move the overall mail through by using
overall AI capabilities, than their overall manual function. So this is something that we
believe the edge platform will be an enormous part of the type of compute that will
happen. In the years to come, we'll see every single device focusing on a overall
ability to accelerate and we believe, our platform is very well positioned for that.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Great. Before I move on to the gaming, I just wanted to see if there are any questions
in the audience. If there are questions, I would just ask for you to wait for the
microphone. Okay. Why don't we move over to the gaming side of your business.
50% of your overall business, you entered this year with the business down 40%,
you're exiting it with it being up 50% year-over-year. But Q4 from a sequential basis
is going to be down primarily on notebooks and your console business just normal
seasonal trends but desktop is driving a strong upgrade cycle with your RTx
platforms, the ramp of your new GTX SUPER mainstream platforms and a strong
lineup to go along with that of blockbuster games that support your ray tracing
technology, sticking with desktop for a moment in talking with your board level
partners, game developers, retailers, what's your sense on the demand pull this
holiday season and as you look into the lineup of games for 2020, how do you see
the demand trends for this coming year?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So we entered into the holiday season, the holiday season starts as early as
November, holiday season for example, starts with Singles' Day on 11/11. A very
important start of that overall holiday and we're actually not done, we're waiting now
for Chinese New Year, which is usually at that tail-end of our overall holiday season.
But each of the overall points that you have probably seen through, discussions with
the overall channel and the partners is its actually going quite well. It's going quite
well up and through our overall expectations that we had planned for the quarter, as
we do have a full-lineup available. We have a lineup that now focuses on ray tracing
and bringing ray tracing down into the upper $200 of a retail price for you to overall
be able to appreciate the overall ray tracing capabilities, but this also allows us to
inﬂuence all types of overall sales not just focus on desktop.
As you know, we are focused in terms of on the notebooks, our notebooks over the
last several years have continued to outgrow what we have seen in terms of the
desktop, our overall notebook business is approaching approximately one-third of
our overall gaming business as a whole. So an important piece and you'll see a
signiﬁcant amount of that out here at CES.
The overall OEMs have focused on this notebook is in a unique niche for them to
attract the overall gamers. The gamers that aren't necessarily interested in building
their own overall desktops, but now can have that high-performance in their overall
notebook design. Our overall ray tracing even from a desktop standpoint has nowFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-01-07

Colette Kressaccumulated to be more than 60% of our overall sales on the desktop and is making
a good path in terms of with the notebooks as well.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
And then, so let's -- let's talk about the cloud gaming segment of the market, NVIDIA
has its GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform, you've announced some partnerships
with regional global telco service providers. At the recent GTC in China, NVIDIA and
Tencent announced a partnership, where you'll be supporting Tencent, the largest
gaming company in China, largest gaming company globally by providing them with
your GPU technology to power their cloud gaming platform. Can you give us more
insights into the partnership, will you be supplying your GeForce NOW architecture
or are you just going to be supporting them more with your GPU products. And
when do you expect the service to kind of go mainstream?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So right now, our relationship with Tencent has always been there as a continuation
of not only focusing on gaming in China, but also in focusing in terms of in the data
center. This was an opportunity for us to align with a very important partner in
overall, China. Tencent here to endorse the growth of overall cloud gaming, even
though we're still in the early stages. They have right now overall pods focused on
building out into their overall data center and will come to market soon in terms of
their testing. Testing the overall ﬁrst pass of some of the software that is necessary
and will come out later in terms of where they are in that overall relationship, ready
to go overall live. But we're excited about this as an important partnership, a
partnership that allows us to both respect the overall ecosystem as they continue to
address the overall gaming market, it's a win-win for both Tencent and NVIDIA
gaming.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
And actually, that's a good segue because Tencent like I said, is the largest gaming
company in the world. But they are also the largest gaming company in China and I
always bring up China on the conference calls because it is the largest gaming
market in the world, 700 million gamers in China, obviously, the home of Tencent
and many of your key data center customers are in China as well. I remember, when
you started oﬀ calendar year 2019, Tencent speciﬁcally called out weak demand
trends in China but China demand especially gaming, it seems to have come back
strong. So help us understand what's driving the China demand?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah, I think, a year ago, probably in a diﬀerent space in China did have probably
some slower quarters than we had expected, but where we stand right now, things
are growing quite well in overall China. China is an important part of our overall
gaming business, but also very important part of our data center business as you
inferred. But what we see there is the adoption of our full stack, our full stack not just
focused on in terms of our ray tracing but we also sell cars into that market that areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-01-07
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 11Harlan Sur
Colette Kressimportant just for overall gaming as a whole, but allows them to have both the new
architecture even if they may -- not the overall ray tracing. It's an important piece
when you think about the overall iCAFE market there. The iCAFE market is one of its
own not necessarily something that's always worldwide but important part of overall
China. We continue to see them looking for the overall upgrade opportunities of our
platform and we continue to hold a signiﬁcant market share in China against many of
our peers.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Before I move on to autos, are there any questions from the audience on either
gaming or data center segments of the business. Okay, why don't we switch to auto,
auto is roughly 5% to 6% of your business. But with a long tailwind and expected to
grow strongly as the market transitions more and more towards autonomous driving,
you guys announced strong success with your Xavier SOC platform. And as you
mentioned at GTC in Shanghai, you announced your Orin platform, help us
understand the diﬀerences between Orin platform, help us understand the
diﬀerence between Xavier, Orin and maybe discuss the timelines on when we should
start to see ﬁrst production volumes of your AV platforms with your major auto OEM
partners.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Great. So we announced our next overall architecture for the SOC and focusing on a
big piece of that on our overall automotive partnerships. So Orin is probably about
7x the overall compute capacity in terms of what we had with Xavier and Xavier was
probably top of line against any overall competitive view of it even from a standpoint
of their PowerPoints [ph] that they may have had of something in the future.
We know the importance of the overall data collection, the data processing that is
going to be necessary inside of the AV cars as we move forward. So we see this as
something that we'll have in the hands of our overall auto customers in the couple of
years ahead, but an important piece in terms of ﬁnishing up that full platform.
Our platform view and focus in terms of AV cars is not just focused in terms of on the
production, it's focused, as well as back in terms of the data center, you've seen us
focus on creating the overall ability for them to overall test their platforms with both
simulated data and or live data. There is a signiﬁcant amount of training the overall
data for these overall AV cars. We're seeing what we will call is a fork in the road of
the type of AV that we are working on with many of our overall OEMs, focusing on
AV that will focus on high Level 2 moving to Level 3 but also on the other side,
focusing on robo taxis or focusing on Level 4 and overall above.
We can do these two things separately with Level 2 plus working on high end
passenger cars and looking at Level 4 with removing the overall driver and what
we'll ﬁnd is conﬁned overall scenarios. Now, what we're seeing in the overall market
for automotive is it's taking them a little bit longer, the investment that they need to
focus on this is something that's going to draw them out, probably closer to the
2022 time frame versus a little bit earlier than what we have had previouslyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-01-07

ones with a full platform today, that they can build upon, test upon of something that
would actually be inside the production pod.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Great. Any updates for us on the proposed acquisition of Mellanox. I know, you're
waiting for China approval.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So with our Q3 results, we had announced that we believe that the closure of our
Mellanox acquisition would probably fall into the ﬁrst couple areas of 2020 and even
since then we have reached overall regulatory approval with the overall EU. With the
EU, with unconditional and nothing holding us back in terms of when we actually
close. So yes, we are waiting on China. And again, we do believe this will close in the
ﬁrst part of 2020.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
So ﬁrst half of 2020 is that...
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
The ﬁrst part of 2020, we have to see.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Okay, last question on the ﬁnancials. There was a big step up in gross margins last
quarter 64%, the kind of back to the gross margin levels during the ﬁrst half of 2018.
Part of that is normalization of the business, you guys are past the inventory
overhang. The higher margin data center business is starting to have ﬂat and gaming
continues to perform very-very strongly through the holiday. So how do you -- how
should we think about the sustainability of the 64% plus sort of gross margin proﬁle
going forward?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah, so our gross margin has always been inﬂuenced probably by the biggest piece
being our overall mix. The mix starts even with our overall gaming business and with
inside our overall gaming business. We have many high-end overall gaming, overall
cards and platforms that inﬂuence just the overall growth of gross margin. We
continue to see an opportunity for people to both upgrade and upgrade choosing a
higher end overall card, but the overall ray tracing capability also allows us to
appreciate higher gross margins.
Then you discuss in terms of what data center and/or ProViz does to our gross
margin as well. Now that we've seen a return in terms of the growth both from aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-01-07

overall gross margins. As we move forward, we will continue to concentrate and see
that growth likely improve in the future, but it will probably change a bit quarter-by-
quarter with the mix.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
