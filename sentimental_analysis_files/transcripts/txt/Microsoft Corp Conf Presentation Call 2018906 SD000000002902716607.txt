All right. We're going to go ahead and get started here for the morning session on
Thursday at the Citi 2008 (sic) (2018) Global Tech Conference. Thanks, everybody, for
joining us. I know there's a few out getting breakfast still. If you could make your way
into the room, we're going to go ahead and get started.
I'm going to read the safe harbor statement from Microsoft ﬁrst. And then we'll get
going. So before we begin, Microsoft may make some forward-looking statements
during this presentation. And you should refer to their SEC ﬁlings for the risk factors
related to their business. And that's true whether you're here in person or listening
on the web.
So I'm, again, Walter Pritchard, software analyst here. Very happy to have Judson
Althoﬀ, who is the EVP of Worldwide Commercial Business at Microsoft.
I'm going to go through a number of questions that I prepared and -- to explore
mostly the business that Judson is responsible for, which is their overall commercial
business, including Oﬃce, Azure, the Windows business in the -- on the business
side.
Then happy to take some questions. We'll have some microphones going around. If
folks want to raise their hand, we'll get you a microphone
So Judson, thanks a lot for coming. Appreciate it very much, representing.

{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
So the company's executed really well on the transition from an on-premise software
company to cloud services. Stepping back, where are we broadly in that transition?
And what's still to come?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes, sure. So I think it'd probably be good for me to just kind of you give a broad
brush on sort of how Microsoft is doing in this cloud transformation as well as sort of
largely on the market. I would tell you that we're both reasonably pleased on our
progress as well as super bullish about the future. About 85% of our enterprise
customers are already using 1 or more of our cloud services. And so we've had great
growth in that regard. We're at about a $7 billion run rate now as of the last quarter,
$6.9 billion. But the bullish side of it is that, that still only represents about 25% of our
overall business; a little less than that, in fact. So the upside in terms of continuing to
work with our own enterprise customer base and drive more growth even within that
realm is huge. Then if you look at what's actually happening to the IT market overall,
Gartner would tell you about 23% of enterprise IT spend right now is cloud based.
So it sort of tracks to what our same ratio is. But that is expanding dramatically,
growing 50% year-over-year on the platform side and about 30% on the SaaS side.
When we look at what our opportunity is though, not only do we see a huge
opportunity to capture more of the $2.5 trillion IT spend. We actually see the IT
spend dramatically increasing overall. So what was classically thought of as IT, an
opportunity for companies like Microsoft is, in our view, going to double over the
next 10 years. And sort of unpacking that and explaining how or why that is. So much
of what we do with customers in the cloud today and at the edge is about really
transforming their business. And so classically, what would have been thought to as
COGS not related to IT is digitizing. And so when we look at an opportunity for a
large retailer or grocer in their stores to help them keep food fresh, it's not about the
servers we might sell them in the back of the oﬃce or the PCs that we might sell in
the front of the oﬃce. It's everything from the sensor, the sensor fabrics, the large
data stores, the AI capabilities that then help them reason over supply chain
management for fresher foods. So eﬀectively, you can almost look at the IT market as
expanding into the world of COGS. And so we see about a $2 trillion expansion on
that market overall. And there's great objective evidence of that. We have some of
our largest enterprise customers now spending in order of magnitude more with us
year-over-year than they ever have had before.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Got it. And so your primary role is running the sort of the front oﬃce, the sales side
of the organization in the commercial area. You made a number of changes, sort of
evolved the structure of the sales force, how they're paid, as sort of adoption has
happened of cloud services. Can you just review sort of what the changes are, where
you are today and what your goals are going forward in terms of how you pay your
people?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-06

Sure. So by way of background, I've been with the company for a little over ﬁve years
now. I came to the company originally to run North America, did that for three years.
Then Satya asked me to run our commercial business globally. So my day job is
running sales services and support for everything we sell from large corporate
enterprises down to small businesses and public sector entities around the world.
And it's about a $70 billion business for Microsoft. The transformation we've gone
through really has been sort of left to right across the company. And it's been a really
pretty simple thesis, if you will. I mean, we've basically changed the company around
the way in which we see the world of technology evolving. So we really see this
paradigm shift of the intelligent edge and the intelligent cloud reshaping how every
customer thinks about technology today. And it's really pretty simple. At the end of
the day, people experience life through technology. And so we deliver product to
market in 6 core solution areas, from gaming to modern life technologies, modern
workplace technologies, business applications and applications in infrastructure,
core apps and infrastructure in the cloud as well as data and AI. And those 6 solution
areas allow us to go to market both in a consumer sense, gaming, modern life,
mostly consumer; the other 4 in the commercial space. So we pivoted all of our
engineering resources around those 6 solution areas, lined them up, not by product
as we were previously but more by solution set. And it's allowed us to create more
seamless oﬀerings for our customers. On the sales side of things, we went through,
last ﬁscal year, which for us ended in June, the largest reorganization that the
company's ever been through and given our size and scale, perhaps the largest the
industry has seen. We eﬀectively changed the model that 50,000 people go to work
in every day, predicated on a really simple thesis, put the right resource in front of
the right customer at the right time. We implemented an industry model focused on
ﬁnancial services, retail, manufacturing, health care, government and education,
automotive and telco. The company never had one before. So I'd have a sales team
in Cincinnati, Ohio calling on the Fifth Third Bank, Kroger and P&G, has absolutely no
ability to learn either of those industries to help a company truly transform. So
reorganized the sales force by industry. That then had an artifact back into the
engineering organization so that we actually build diﬀerentiated oﬀerings for
industry, recruit partners that line up for those industries as well. The second thing
we did was to completely revamp the technology capability within the ﬁeld. Look, we
had historically a lot of sales overlay resources. The Microsoft bus would show up if
you wanted to hear about our product lines. We had a lot of people who would sit
you down and give you a PowerPoint presentation about our products ad nauseam.
And we made a tough decision to let a lot of those folks go and replace them with
developers. So I've hired, over the last year, more than 3,000 developers into the
sales force so that we can actually code with our customers and help them really
digitize everything they do within their business.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
So sort of a sales engineer-type function?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes, exactly. But more than just what I would sort of traditionally call presales SE
person, these are actually folks that rotate in and out of engineering. So they mayFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-06
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 13Q - Walter H Pritchardspend two years writing mainline code for Azure and then rotate out into the ﬁeld
and help our customers with the latest Kubernetes capabilities and things like that.
So that's been huge for us. We lined those folks up by the same solution areas that I
spoke of before in our commercial space, modern workplace, business applications,
apps and data and AI. So the symmetry between the ﬁeld and the engineering
organization has helped us tremendously. The third thing we did was to build a
customer success organization. You can think of this eﬀectively as non-billable
consulting that I pay for on my dime. These are people that live with our customers
beyond the deal to make sure that our cloud services actually get infused into
business processes that you don't have the cloud equivalent of shelf wear in the
software world. Also been huge for us because the adoption and the actual
utilization of the services has increased dramatically over the last year. It's why we're
so bullish about the long-term trajectory of the business because we can see
through telemetry, the usage curves and have some pretty good predictability about
where those are headed. So those 3 big things we did to really increase the density
of coverage on our largest customers. Now you go and do that, you have to ﬁgure
out how to pay for it, right? So the next 2 things we did were really to add scale to
the rest of our business outside of the enterprise. We have created what I call a new
digital selling force. And think of this as sort of the modern era inside sales or call
center teams. We have used our own technology, we drink our own wine, if you will.
And have implemented an AI reasoning capability that links everything we do in
marketing for all of our anonymous interactions with customers. And that then feeds
demand response into our inside sales teams. And then they actually come to work
every day. They've got a queue of calls, 100 diﬀerent calls they could make. The
reasoning -- the Cognitive Services basically tell them which 3 calls they should make
ﬁrst, what to say when they're on the phone with the customer, which specialist to
pull into the deal or which partner to help with the opportunity and has created far
more eﬃcient way at reaching tens of thousands of customers around the world at
scale. That then, coupled with revamping our entire partner organization around this
notion that we want to build with our partners, build IP, build services practices, help
them take the same to market and then help them sell the same has really helped us
build much more scale. Then those 5 things kind of hinge together on the
compensation model. We took a big leap. We don't pay people anymore on what we
sell. In fact, less than 20% of the compensation plan for any of our people is tied to
what they might sell to a customer. We pay our people on what our customers use
and the value that they get out of our solutions. That provides a real interesting hook
into this notion of helping even our enterprise customers take their IP to market in
the cloud. As I was talking to you a little bit before we walked up here, we have some
traditional commercial customers that have become what we call digital partners.
The best example of this is the work we do with Boeing. I mean, Microsoft has been
selling technology to Boeing for decades. But the work we've done over the recent
years is we've actually taken their digital aviation assets, put them on our Azure
platform and we co-sell with them to other airlines around the world. This drives
huge top line revenue for them, helps them be much more nimble in their
implementation. Then our people are actually engaged with them at the face of the
customer to deal with things like the cloud architecture, data privacy, security and
sovereignty. And it works very, very well with us.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-06
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 13A - Judson AlthoﬀGot it, got it. Super thorough answer there. Appreciate that. So you brought up
digital transformation a couple of times. I had a joke a couple of days ago from a
client that they met with a copy machine company and they were doing digital
transformation. So I feel like this word is getting a little bit kind of overused. So
maybe you could kind of break it apart for folks in terms of the agenda that your
customers have? And maybe speciﬁcally, what should solution sets -- or I know
you're not talking products as much. But there are a lot of us that think in product
terms. What sort of tangibly -- the -- what parts of the business that you run have
seen a boost from this trend in the market?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
So ﬁrst of all, you're absolutely right, digital transformation is sort of this digital
washing of everything. Every new sale is, "Hi. we did a digital transformation at
Company XYZ." We try to actually help our customers in a fairly consultative way,
unpack what it actually means for them pragmatically. And whilst no 2 are really alike,
we do kind of sort of think of it in 4 pillars. The ﬁrst is employee empowerment. So if
you're going to really be a digital company, your people have to work in a digital
world. And so a great example of this is work that we've done with Carlsberg
breweries. If you think about the diversity of workforce in a brewery, you have
everybody who -- from like folks who are driving trucks delivering beer to bars to
people who have their PhD in yeast science. Then -- had I known you could get your
PhD on beer, I probably would have picked a diﬀerent path. But in all seriousness,
these are folks who don't ﬁnd commonality very often. But by putting mobile
technologies into the hands of the people who drive the trucks, connecting them
through our Microsoft Teams products to everything from the marketing department
to the yeast science teams, you can actually help their product evolution by
empowering their employees. So we've done work with them to sort of say, "Well
hey, how would you launch new products in new markets based on the data that you
have coming oﬀ of this empowered employee set?" We ran an experiment with them
and said, "Hi. listen, we think we ought -- you ought to take your Russian pilsner,
remarket it and launch it in SÃƒÂ£o Paulo, Brazil because of the matching of the
customer data that we have, the customer sensibility we have as well as the tasting
preferences we have coming oﬀ the yeast data," which to them was almost
blasphemy. They're like, "I'm not going to sell Russian beer in SÃƒÂ£o Paulo. What
are you talking about?" Lo and behold, we sold 30% more beer in SÃƒÂ£o Paulo
than we ever had sold in St. Petersburg. So by digitizing the workforce, empowering
employees, you get great progress. Categorically, we think about empowering
employees. We think about rethinking customer engagement. So a lot of work
happens in terms of, for example, in retail, helping customers develop omni-channel
strategies that allow them to manage customer relationships in a less transactional
way, more from anonymous through to advocacy, lots of work around optimizing
operations. We are weekly working with dozens of customers, moving their SAP
environment to the cloud. And when you do that, the operational burden that you
leave behind is huge. So lots of diﬀerentiation there. In fact, SAP is running their own
S/4 HANA instance on Azure. So lots of great triangulation work there. Then the
fourth pillar is around product transformation. And it's probably the most interesting
of all of the 4 DT categories that we work on. And the question that needs to be
asked and answered is how can the data about your business become more
valuable than the business itself. And my favorite example here is the work we've
done with Maersk. If you think about their business, right, you -- big global shippingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-06
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 13Q - Walter H Pritchard
A - Judson Althoﬀcompany, not a lot of room for them to grow. They already have 60% of the world's
market share. There's only so much fuel optimization you can drive to shave the
bottom line. So what's the next generation of growth? Well we've helped them
basically take all of the data about their business and create software assets with it.
So if you think about it, they know where every product is in the world's global trade
market at any given point in time. And so the ability to hedge on supply chain
becomes a reality in addition to sort of oﬀering end-to-end logistics capabilities for
last-mile delivery. So those are the 4 categories that we help customers work
through. Again, it has to be a very consultative approach because what we do for
Maersk and what we do for Boeing and what we do for Walmart and what we do for
Adobe are all very diﬀerent things. But if you kind of methodically walk through
those 4 pillars, you ﬁnd massive opportunities for customers to reshape their
businesses.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Yes, I agree. Got it. Maybe diving a little bit deeper into Azure, growing really fast in a
pretty competitive space. You've got AWS, I think the -- at this point, the undisputed
leader in terms of revenue. Can you talk about the strategy that Microsoft has to
grow that business? And what elements of that part of the business are really
resonating with customers?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes, sure. So look, no question AWS was ﬁrst. They are the big dogs to chase in all of
this. But year-over-year, I would say we feel very, very good about the progress we're
making in terms of gaining market share. So that cloud platform market right now is
growing at about 50% year-over-year. Azure grew nearly twice that this last year. And
it's on the strength of massive Fortune 500 relationships from Walmart to Adobe to
Ford to Telstra to E&Y. I mean, you name it. Fortune 500, across every industry,
people are betting on Azure. And you see we'd say, "Well okay. Why?" And sure, we
have some really good relationships with those folks. But it comes down to a couple
of things really. It comes down to: one, the ﬂexibility of our oﬀering. I talked about
the edge in the cloud. We've been doing hybrid before hybrid was cool. And the
platform we enable is completely heterogeneous. Whether you want to use
Microsoft assets or open-source assets, do it on-prem, you want to do it on the
cloud, we oﬀer a common platform for developers to build product from left to right.
The security fabric that's a part of that as well enables customers to very quickly latch
on to whatever local security, data privacy, sovereignty and regulatory concerns
there might be in the markets that they operate in. So the platform itself, the hybrid
capabilities within it, a huge diﬀerentiator. The second big diﬀerentiator for us is
trust. We spent a lot of time investing in being super clear with our customers that
their data is their data, it's not our data; their IP is their IP, it's not our IP. And in
addition, even our patent portfolio is something we extend to our customers as
they're looking to digitize their businesses. And that's been huge in terms of
building that enterprise trust and credibility because as the biggest of enterprises
move to the cloud, the highly regulated market still haven't had huge adoption yet,
that's critically important. And I would say the other big reason is, is that, without
sounding too competitive, the reality of the situation is, is if you look at the 2 other
big competitors in this space, Amazon is, frankly, attacking a lot of industries right
now. And they're pretty bold and open about it. I mean, Jeﬀ will say, "Look, yourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-06
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 13Q - Walter H Pritchard
A - Judson Althoﬀmargin is my opportunity." And there's evidence of that -- huge evidence of that in
retail, of course. But also ﬁnancial services and health care. And so I think our
enterprise customers come to us going, "Hi. look, we want to go to the cloud. We're
not interested in going to the cloud with somebody who's interested in taking our
business. Microsoft, you've known our business for decades." So there's that
enterprise trust factor. Then I think Google is seen as actually less of a direct attack.
But a huge tax burden, if you will. If you think about the single greatest tax on any
electronic commerce or digital interaction, it's search, it's ads. And so yes, you can
seek out Google as a platform provider. But the reality is, is that, that's going to
actually turn into a reverse burden on your business. So I'd say those 3 things, our
business model, trust factor, the hybrid capabilities within the platform itself, are the
biggest driver why we're growing twice the speed of the market right now.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Got it. Then on the hybrid side. So you mentioned you've been doing hybrid before
hybrid is cool. Azure is a key asset in your hybrid strategy. Could you talk about
where customers are in hybrid adoption? And I guess, speciﬁcally, give us an update
on Azure Stack. I know it's a fairly early product for -- that has been out for about a
year. But how is that product doing?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. So we're super pleased with Azure Stack right now. We're taking orders at the
threshold of our ability to deliver at this point. So we're very pleased with that. We're
also pleased with where we're going with Azure Sphere. So if you think about this
notion, the edge to the cloud, especially with the onset of 5G coming, I mean, you
can really basically put compute everywhere, from the furthest edge through to
midpoints and aggregate all the way to the public cloud. And the deep investments
we've made in this space, having a common framework for identity management, a
common data platform, a common security model, a common development model, I
mean, even Google uses VS Code inside of their environment because our tools are
so rich in supporting DevOps scenarios. The platform itself has been built from the
ground up with hybrid in mind. And we think that, that's really going to take oﬀ,
again, especially with 5G. And we're doing hacks right now with customers -- well, a
German auto manufacturer, whereby they're taking -- at the very edge of their
autonomous and semiautonomous vehicles, they're taking in imagery, of course, to
do navigation and accident avoidance. And we have AI services running at the edge
of their car, basically de-identifying all of the facial recognition for GDPR
requirements. So if you think about the elaborate and elegance in the compute
model there at the edge and the ability to say, "Well okay, where do we want to run -
- have running at the car? What do we want to have running at any type of cellular
endpoint with the telco providers? And what do we want have running in the public
cloud? And oh, by the way, what if we changed our mind?" I mean, the Azure
platform is really the only thing that can deliver in that regard today. So we see huge
growth there. Then there's the ﬁnancial aspect of it. We have stepped forward pretty
aggressively and said, "Anything you use of ours in a hybrid capacity, whether it be
Windows servers, SQL Server, any of our core on-premises software assets, you pay
for once." So in the scenario I just described, rather than paying for it 3 times, you're
paying for it once. And if you project out what the competition would have to do,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-06

designed in a superior way. And the cost structure is dramatically lower.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Great. Got it, got it. So I'm going to go to one more topic here. We'll take a
microphone around. After that, I can keep going if there's no questions. But Judson,
on the Oﬃce side, I think we've seen -- this business has been around for a very long
time. The economy is good right now. I think that's driving some corporate C growth.
You've also done some things in the product, moved it to Oﬃce 365. You're adding
a lot more value as it's cloud hosted. Could you help maybe unpack a little bit the
growth drivers in Azure and Oﬃce and the macro plus some of the product side
drivers?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. Well -- so it's really interesting because the traditional PC market, of course, has
been under a lot of pressure. Yet, Oﬃce has been growing double digits now for 5
straight quarters. And I think the biggest reason for that is the heterogeneous way in
which we've enabled Microsoft experiences on all endpoints. We now have more
than 100 million active users of our Oﬃce 365 products on iOS and Android. And so
the growth really is not tied to the form factor of the PC as much as it is just the
human experience. It's also done great things for us in terms of expanding the
creativity and collaboration software assets. Microsoft Teams is really on ﬁre right
now. More than 200,000 entities use Microsoft Teams already. We have -- in just 1.5
years' time, we have more paid users of Microsoft Teams than Slack does. And they
sort of invented this notion of teams and tribes collaboration. Part of that is because
the same good old Oﬃce products that you sort of grew up and loved are infused
right into the Team's fabric. So the collaboration is super easy. But this notion of
Microsoft 365 as an oﬀering that encapsulates Oﬃce 365, Windows 10 and our
Enterprise Mobility Suite, everything basically we take down to mobile devices, has
been huge for us because the suite driver has so much value for customers. Each
independent oﬀering has its own strong growth. And the Oﬃce in the cloud grew
29% year-over-year. Windows 10 is now on 700 million devices. EMS, as I described,
the basis for growth on the mobile side as well as the identity fabric and security
fabric that cuts across the same has been really strong for us. And it feeds well into
Dynamics, Dynamics as a business applications product. We've had the strongest
year we've ever had in Dynamics. Dynamics in the cloud grew 61% year-over-year.
And the large enterprise customers taking on Dynamics instead of Salesforce has
been huge, from American Airlines, to Walmart, to Nedbank, to Adobe, to HP, to
Lenovo. We're seeing huge enterprise strength there. And it's because when you
weave together the Microsoft 365 productivity environment or the Dynamics 365
environment, now you're reasoning over the same graph of data to, once again, help
your employees be more productive. It's been good for us.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 13A - Judson Althoﬀ
Q - Walter H Pritchard
A - Judson AlthoﬀJust a broad question on medium-, long-term sort of view on proﬁtability of
commercial cloud operation. Margins have been sort of trending down because of
the transition from on-prem to cloud. Then it feels like we might be towards a level
where margins could start to trend up. I just wondered whether you could
qualitatively give us some color on that. And related to Dynamics, you just
mentioned it's still a small business for Microsoft but what's the aspiration? What sort
of(, given the)level, do you think you could get to that -- because it's still a small
contributor relative to Oﬃce and other businesses you've got in there?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes, okay.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
So maybe the -- we don't have the CFO on stage for the margin question. But do
what you can.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
2 for 1, yes. I mean, you asked -- qualitatively, I can tell you. Quantitatively, that's for
Amy to answer. But qualitatively, I can tell you margins are continuously improving
because of the shared nature of the state of where we are in this growth trajectory. I
mean, when you enter a new market, you enter a new market where -- I should say
markets. Because whether you're talking about the platform business and our
competitors in AWS and Google or the productivity realm where we lead or the
business applications realm where we're a challenger as well, when you enter those
markets and it's a share gain, margins are under pressure. But as our growth in share
and trajectory improves, which it is dramatically, in all 3 of those realms, we're
growing faster than market, our ability to command higher margins is also
improving. So I think you'll see good improvement there. Amy can give you the
details. On the business application side, in terms of where we see the business
growing, it's interesting. Because the way to look at Dynamics is to look at it, sure, as
its own discrete business. But then also the knock-on eﬀect, if you will, on our other
businesses. Take, for example, the work that we do with Adobe and SAP. The beauty
of Dynamics is that you don't have to actually rip and replace your existing CRM or
ERP environment so you can eﬀectively leverage it to implement a fairly nimble
business process on top of any existing applications environment. So we may bid in
a given situation with Dynamics 365, along with Adobe, along with SAP. We may win
certain components of the oﬀering. And that's what's driving a lot of the growth. But
what drags behind it is massive growth for Azure and the data behind it. So both
Azure as well as the LinkedIn asset beneﬁts hugely from Dynamics even if Dynamics
itself is not a huge driver. But in this case, we actually -- like I said, we have a healthy
growth. I think that there are customers that are tiring of the expense related to
Salesforce. Salesforce is a great solution. There's good folks running the company
over there. But it's expensive. And customers aren't seeing the incremental value for
what they want to charge and the incremental increases in subscription costs that
they're placing on them. So we're doing a lot of heavy-lifting and migration work
over to Dynamics 365 because it's a much lower-cost environment. It's a much more
open environment. I mean, it's just sort of proof is in the pudding there with all the
integration work that we do with Adobe and SAP.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-06

Any others? So -- we do have one.
When you were giving your hybrid sales example, you said that, "We're not charging
the customer 3 times. We're only charging them once." But presumably, the price
you charge them is somewhere between 3 -- total price of 3 separate instances of an
application versus one. You aren't -- you're not just giving away the other 2, you're
capturing value that's reﬂected in the one price? Or are you just charging the lowest
price?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Well -- so strictly speaking, I'll just unpack it a little bit more pragmatically. If you have
SQL Server licenses from Microsoft and they are currently running on an on-premises
server and you now want to take that workload to the cloud and run SQL in the
cloud, if you do that with either Amazon or Google, you have to relicense it on their
platforms. If you do it with Azure. So -- it's free because you already own the asset.
Does that make sense?
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
And you pay for the Azure would be the -- so part of your answer is you pay more
since you're buying Azure?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes, right.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
So any other questions? We do have one. These are good questions. So we'll keep
going. Michael?
I think we all see the growth in Azure. But I think there's also still a lingering concern,
at the end of the day, it's a declining business with a race to 0 pricing. Can you speak
to the state of that?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes, sure. I think there are aspects of the cloud platform market that will be a
commodity business and will be a race to 0. If you look at strictly Infrastructure-as-a-
Service and storage -- compute and storage, yes, that will be a chase to the bottom
and may the best price win. There are a couple of things though that even in that
realm, I think, will lead to an advantage for us. I think the pure R&D on things that we
do in the compute realm from quantum computing to cryogenic computing, the
data centers that we're putting on the ocean ﬂoor, those will actually give us a
competitive advantage in terms of the COGS related to even just pure infrastructureFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-06

Q - Walter H Pritchardand storage. So I actually feel pretty good about even the worst part of that business.
The parts for us though that I think will lead to long-term diﬀerentiation and, again,
some pricing power in the market are the platform services that we're oﬀering. Take
for example Cosmos DB. Cosmos DB is the -- really the only planet-scale database
on the market. It can run in every Azure instance. It will eventually be able to run in
every Azure Stack and Azure Sphere incarnation as well. And so you'll be able to put
-- you'll be able to decide as a customer where you want your data to be and how to
reason over it. And you basically conquer sort of the speed-of-light issues that any
other singular-instance cloud platform database would have. In addition to that, it's
100% open. So if you've invested in anti-standard SQL or Cassandra or Mongo in
terms of your big data interfaces or key value interfaces, you have to eﬀectively
move that code over in a singularity without having to do any re-platform work.
That's a huge diﬀerentiation that we oﬀer in any kind of operational data
environment, any kind of AI sensing environment. The Cognitive Services that we're
delivering to market and the library of services that we have there is materially
greater than the competition. And so it will be the platform services, the ISV
portfolio, the IP that you deliver that's vertically diﬀerentiated that will provide us
with pricing power on the cloud platform.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Any others? So a couple of good follow-ups here on the Azure IC side. I guess I
wanted to ask you to a follow-up on the Oﬃce PBP side. So E5 and some of these
sort of higher-level, more expensive SKUs in Oﬃce have been good drivers. Could
you talk about what -- there's security. There's data analytics. There's a number of
diﬀerent -- there's telephony, a few diﬀerent sort of avenues that customers pursue
there to get an E5. What are you seeing in terms of E5 adoption? And what are the
drivers sort of today versus where they were initially?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. We feel great about E5 right now. It's interesting. The #1 driver is security,
followed very closely behind by analytics and Power BI. We really feel good about
competing with and against Tableau with Power BI. In fact, we're replacing them left
and right. When customers can eﬀectively buy a suite with E5 that says, "Well gosh, I
get all of these security beneﬁts from advanced threat protection for my Windows
estate, my mobile devices and heterogenous endpoint protection through to my
core Oﬃce 365 tenet. And in addition to that, I get eﬀectively Power BI along with
that and then also eﬀectively Teams," where we're taking Skype and the
convergence there, the value is immense. And so that's a huge driver for us. The
stand-alone SKUs themselves are actually also doing incredibly well because people
will look at it as either, "Well okay, I'll make an investment on the suite and roll it out
from left to right" or they'll say, "Well look, I'll start -- my security problem is my
biggest one. So I'm going to start with the security assets and then move into the
rest of the suite over time." So it's been very strong. And we're bullish on the
continuing growth right now because of the sort of share within the total base of the
customer for E5 is still relatively small. So the growth opportunity is quite large.

Q - Walter H PritchardGot it. Maybe diving into that a little bit more. I get this question a lot from investors,
both on the Microsoft side as well as I cover the security space. Security is a massive
market. You've got tens of billions of dollars. Microsoft has sort of played a little bit in
that market. But there's a lot of money spent by customers on adding something on
to Exchange or Oﬃce 365 to secure it. The same with the PC. You've got
authentication solutions. People are sort of folding into active directory and so forth.
What's the sort of higher-level strategy with Microsoft around security? And how do
you view that as a revenue opportunity given your seat on the sales side?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. It's a good question. Because -- security is one of these markets, as you pointed
out, where -- if you take this approach, where like there can only be one or we want
to kind of mop up all of these sort of niche vendors in this space, you'll be at it for a
long time because the number of vendors that every company has on their security
oﬀering is enormous, multiple dozens on average. And so what we seek to do is to
provide a common platform for security. First, starting with our own assets. If you
want to secure Oﬃce 365, you want to secure your Windows estate, the very best
way to do it is with our security oﬀerings. And the lowest-cost way to do it is with our
oﬀerings because, eﬀectively, it's like the Prego spaghetti sauce thing. It's in there,
right? Then you sort of take the next leap and extension to that, that says, well, also
you leverage active directory and Azure active directory in the cloud for all your
identity and multifactor authentication for all of your mobile endpoints. And so we
want to have that as an inclusive oﬀering in the portfolio. And so eﬀectively, that's the
security that you get within Microsoft 365. That same security model and identity
graph then ﬂows into Dynamics 365. It's then available for you as an asset in Azure.
So if you're writing your own bespoke applications, if you're using any ISV that's on
top of the platform, we seek to dramatically lower the cost for anything related to the
portfolio eﬀectively. Where there will always be additional value-add is largely in the
consultancies that help customers through cyberattack scenarios and that kind of
thing. It's not really our core business. We have a lot of partners that we leverage in
that regard and that sort of build on our stack. So will there be some consolidation in
the market? Yes. Will it ever be to the point where like, "Hi. look there's 2 or 3
vendors. And you can get everything you need from one of them?" We don't think
so.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Got it, got it. Well I think with that, we're going to close it out. I see 18 seconds on the
clock. So thank you, everybody. Judson, thank you very much for coming. Appreciate
it.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Thanks for the time.
