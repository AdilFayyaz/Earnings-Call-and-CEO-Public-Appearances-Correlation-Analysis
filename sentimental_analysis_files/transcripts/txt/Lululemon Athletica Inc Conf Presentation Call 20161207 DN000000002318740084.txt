and welcome Rishi and Mike.
Thank you, Poonam. This is Rishi Chhabra from First Data. Appreciate you having us
on this call. Before we get started, let me speak about the exact numbers and what
we saw in the Black Weekend or Black Friday through Cyber Monday. I just want to --
kind of take a step back and talk about First Data, we are one of the largest payment
processors for electronic transactions across the U.S.. We process transactions credit,
debit, prepaid, what have you all kinds of electronic transactions for over 4 million
clients in the U.S. at any given point of time. What we did was as we think about
analyzing a spend for the Black Weekend or Thursday through Monday, we use a
methodology for same-store sales that we do for SpendTrend that Poonam, you and
others at BI are pretty familiar with. And the whole idea here being is, if we keep a
set of merchants constant up for over a period of time, see what the growth is in
spending by consumers in real-time using their electronic payment mechanisms at
those merchant locations.
So for this period, we actually looked at over a million merchants, combination of
both brick and mortar and e-commerce merchants for [ph] whom we process. One
of the things as we make sure these merchants are constant, they have been on the
First Data platform for a while, and their growth and their volumes are normalized.
So everything we're analyzing is true consumer spending, and we look at this from a
year-over-year perspective, to look at growth number is not month-over-month, not
week-over-week, but to normalized for spending patterns at diﬀerent points in the
year or times, we make sure we look at it from a year-over-year perspective.
One of the other things we did just make sure for holiday spending, we excluded
gasoline stations and fuel dispensers, just to make sure that, the gas prices or the
falling in gas prices do not be an eﬀect from a holiday spending perspective.
So if we go over to the next slide, Poonam, to your question, what did we see in this
holiday? We actually saw pretty robust growth. This slide speaks to overall spending,
so this is both retail and non-retail spending, and we'll get to retail spending only as
well.
But if you look at this slide, for 2016, we saw a 7.8% growth just for the Thursday and
Friday. And when you look at the Thursday through Monday numbers, we came in at
5.6% growth in actual dollar volume being spend at these merchant locations year-
over-year. And the 5.6% can be broken out into brick and mortar and e-com.
So brick and mortar was more like 3.7%, and e-com was 12.1% with the weighted
average being 5.6%.
Now if you compare this to a year ago, we have seen pretty strong growth rates a
year ago as well at 7.5%. So you can see that on a year-over-year basis, we have seen
pretty strong growth rate from a overall spending perspective. And we also computeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-05
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 3 of 19Jennifer Bartashus
Rishi Chhabrawhat we call the pre-holiday season, which is the time period leading up to the
holidays. So in this case, it was the time, the 21 days leading up to the Wednesday
before Black Friday -- sorry before Thanksgiving. And the growth rate spend were
about 3.4%, so you can see that sustaining the growth just 3.4%, and the 21 days
leading up to the holiday, and then you had 7.8% for Thursday, Friday. And then net
around nicely at 5.6% for Thursday through Monday.
Similarly, if you go to the next slide, and you look at numbers speciﬁc to retail, very,
very similar trends, numbers being slightly higher. So Thursday, Friday for retail came
in at 9%; and then Thursday through Monday came in at 5.8%. The brick and mortar
being 4.1%, and e-com being 14.3%. Once you would notice that it's the pre-holiday
day leading up to this was slightly sluggish at 1.6%. So clearly, directionally, you could
say that a lot of the consumers were holding back purchases leading up to the big
weekend of the holiday weekend. And it's consistent with the numbers that we're
seeing at our merchant locations that we process for.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
Thanks, Rishi. This is Jen here. Just wanted to ask quick questions. It looks like things
slowed down a little bit from Black Friday into Cyber Monday. Can you just tell us a
little bit more what was happening there?
Yeah. Sure, Jen. Good question, good observation, Jen. I think what happened was,
we saw a pretty robust growth leading up to Thanksgiving, so the week leading up to
the Thursday, especially the Wednesday right before, clearly a lot of spent happen
on the way we see it on the day before Thanksgiving.
Now that is again a mix of retail and non-retail, that's a combination of both, but lot
of spending happened leading up to Thanksgiving, Thursday, Friday came in strong.
And I think Saturday, Sunday, Monday together are lower the averages to some
extent, Monday was strong as well, but overall from a Thursday to Monday
perspective -- if you look at a ﬁve day window versus the two day window to your
point, Jen growth did slowed down a little bit, but it's still consistent with what we
saw exactly a year ago.
I'm just going to head upon this slide, and then I'll move -- I'm happy, if there are any
more questions from the BI team. But if you look at this slide, we clearly are seeing
the trends shifting a lot to Wednesday, it is becoming a big day for shopping and
spending. What we try to do was look at a comparison of growth rates on
Wednesday versus Black Friday, and where is the growth coming from. And if you
can see on Wednesday, it is much stronger on non-retail -- non-retail categories or
MCC codes as we would like to say it.
And driven by food and beverage stores and eating places or eating and drinking
places, clearly, a lot of shopping happening for Thanksgiving. Cooking, eating outFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-05

Rishi Chhabra
Chen Grazutis
Rishi Chhabrawith families, you can see a lot with hotels, leisure as well. So a lot of travel involved
on the day before Thanksgiving compared to the Friday or Thanksgiving.
So clearly, shift in spending in terms of dollars, Wednesday has become a very, very
big day from a spending perspective. But with that said, clearly, if you look at just
retail categories, this has dominated a lot more on Friday versus Wednesday.
{BIO 18919310 <GO>}
And this is Seema, I just had a question, which is the 10% growth that you saw before
one of the biggest selling days of the year, what was the impact on holiday sales?
You're saying that it's diﬀerent categories versus the core retail categories?
That's right. So the 10% was overall, that includes all categories. It is retail and non-
retail. So clearly, there was a big jump in retail as well, but again, lot of the growth
was driven by non-retail categories on Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving.
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
So this is Chen. Can you give us some ideas as you're moving through this
information on any details about what's been happening day-by-day for
Thanksgiving and Black Friday?
Yeah, absolutely, we can do that. And if you look at this particular slide, chen, one of
the things we kind[ph] of see is the share of spend versus online versus brick and
mortar. So the top chart is for overall, so it's all spending retail and non-retail, and the
bottom chart is retail only.
And if you look at the top chart, clearly, as time goes by from 2014 to '15 to '16, '16,
you can look at Thursday and Friday, you can look at Thursday through Monday,
pretty consistent 24%, 25% is online, and 75% is oﬄine.
And lot of that has grown over time, you can compare to 2014, 2015, 2016, you can
clearly see a pattern there on how online spending has a bigger shift or a bigger
share of spend.
And in 2016, if you look at Cyber Monday only, clearly, you can see how much spend
-- 40% of all spend -- dollars being spend are coming from online versus oﬄine.
Similarly, very similar trend in retail-only, you can see a 35-65 shift on Cyber Monday
compare that to -- I would say two years ago in 2014, where you are at 87-13 split. So
a big, big shift to online e-commerce, which I think again, it's not super surprising,
but our data backs up what others are seeing in the economy as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-05
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 5 of 19Mike SpriggsI think Jen, this one is going especially to your question around what trends did we
see by the hour on Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday? This is broken by
hour, and this again looks at all over million merchants, the data that we analyze for.
One of the clear things we saw on Thanksgiving Day, it's a growth rates at lot of our
merchants were negative until about 6:00 PM on Thursday. And I think that's where
lot of the brick and mortar shops, stores or locations opened up the stores this year
compared to last year. So we saw positive and strong growth after malls and stores
opened up, the physical outlets after 6:00 PM are pretty sustained growth all
through Black Friday, and then Cyber Monday as well. And if we click go over to the
next slide, I think we do a deep dive on Cyber Monday.
You can clearly see on the bottom chart, it's brick and mortar, not very, very strong
growth of brick and mortar on Cyber Monday, a lot is driven by e-commerce as you
can see on the top chart. E-com is pretty much dominated all through Cyber Monday
with very, very strong growth rates by the hour, whereas brick and mortar, it was kind
of mix and match through the day. During some hours on Monday, we did see
positive growth rates, were pretty much has been ﬂat for brick and mortar across the
day on Cyber Monday. So lot of the growth on Cyber Monday actually came from e-
commerce sales as one would expect.
Mike, do you want to speak to this speciﬁc slide?
{BIO 1772239 <GO>}
Sure. Yeah. As we look at the progression of sales throughout the day, these slides
kind of show how sales mount, and so each hour adds additional volume to the total.
And so what you'll see in the top left quadrant for Thanksgiving Day is exactly the
kind of thing that Rishi just talked about, whereas we all know a lot of retailers made
a concerted eﬀort to keep the stores closed, kind of as a goodwill gesture, I guess to
their workers. And to be a little bit more observant of the holiday and family time.
And so you see the green line representing brick and mortar activity doesn't really
even kick in until around that late afternoon 6 o'clock hour, it peaks sometime after
6:00 PM. Conversely though, if we kind of put this in the context of what we've all
probably observed for this holiday season, online deals and activity really
encompass the whole month. There are extended deals for online, discounts and
things like that.
And as you can see, there is pretty steady sustained online activity, it's represented
by the red line for Thanksgiving Day. And so what we see here is evidence of the
delivered choices that a lot of retailers have made for this particular holiday season
being manifested in the activity and the behavior of shoppers.
If you look at the chart to the right, and we're looking at Black Friday 2016 just that
day in isolation. We also see how just because of the availability oﬀers leading up to
the holiday weekend, and of course, based on the activity of the merchants, and how
they've adjusted their hours, we see this bill and spend happen a little bit later in a
day. Then we've seen in past days, where stores were opening at 5:00 AM andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-05
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 6 of 19Jennifer Bartashusthings like that, and that still happen, that just didn't seem to drive the behavior this
year. But we do see a kind of an expected bill shape just moved a little bit further
down, the daytime continuum.
If we look at the Cyber Monday, I thought this was interesting. Look at the Cyber
Monday activity, we see that the lines are very close together in terms of how
shoppers were kind of executing their sales across the day. And as the green line
shows, certainly the red line, but as the green line shows. it seems like the shoppers
took more advantage of the regular daytime hours between 11:00 and 4:00 -- 11:00
and 5:00 PM to execute the bulk of the shopping that they did.
And the last one, the bottom right quadrant, the e-commerce slide. This is looking at
e-commerce activity on Thanksgiving, and then on Black Friday, and then on Cyber
Monday. And what you'll see is that for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the e-
commerce activity was pretty consistent. Those lines almost overlap each other
suggesting that consumers kind of behave the same way for both Black Friday and
Cyber Monday. And the red line shows a little bit diﬀerent kind of activity for
Thanksgiving Day. I guess in consideration of all the other things that consumers are
probably taking part in family activities, things like that.
Kind of keep in line with what we just saw with regard to how that shoppers were
executing their spending across time for each of those days. This chart right here
gives us kind of a peak into why these things probably have been the way they did.
The chart on the left, the bar graph on the left is a depiction of essentially the
decrease in the number of stores that were open by hour on Thanksgiving Day for
this year versus Thanksgiving Day last year, and on average, it's about 10% fewer
stores were opened during that time. And that has to translate into a decrease in
traﬃc, and of course a decrease in spend just following the math there. And that's
what you see on the right hand side, there was a huge decline in traﬃc, especially in
the early daytime hours, where this year was totally diﬀerent than last year.
But just like as my colleague pointed out earlier, once the late afternoon rolled
around, and it seem by most reports that we saw most retailers, who chose to open,
chose to open about 4:00 maybe 6:00 PM, so when they did so, you could see an
abrupt shift to the positive in terms of traﬃc and obviously translating into spend for
the day -- for Thanksgiving Day.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
Thanks, Mike. It's Jen here. I just wanted to remind listeners before we go ahead with
the rest of the presentation, that there is -- on the right hand side of the screen, there
is a Q&A box that you can click into and ask questions, we're going to have some
time in the end of the presentation.
Mike, I think we did a great job so far just looking at the spending on retail as a
whole, but I know you guys also look at speciﬁc categories and regions. Can you
share a little bit of that data with us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-05
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 7 of 19Rishi Chhabra
Sure. I think we have that on the slide, I think Mike has a slide up right now. Jen,
obviously, we break down retail, the whole retail into separate merchant categories
and industry categories.
So if you look at the slide, clearly, electronics and appliances was a big winner this
holiday season of those ﬁve data spending. We saw 16.1% growth year-over-year, very
-- almost double or one and half times of what we saw last year at 9.6%. And again,
this is across Thursday to Monday.
If we just look at Thursday, Friday by itself, and I know it's not on this slide, the
growth rates were more like 23% or 24%. So electronic appliances, people were
ﬂocking both brick and mortar, online, ﬂocking to buy electronic and appliances.
We did see a big jump in average ticket of electronics and appliances as well, you'll
see that in one of the slides later in the deck, but when I'm going to that is, the
basket size increased when it comes to electronic appliances, which means not only
people were shopping more, there were more transactions happening electronics
and appliances, these dollars being spent on a per transaction basis went up
drastically as well for electronic and appliances.
We saw a very sustained growth in building materials and garden equipment as well,
11.8% similar to what we had seen along the lines, what we have seen last year at
17.1%. Sporting goods, Harvey's book stores, music stores saw big jump at 7.7%, last
year, this category came in a ﬂat, but saw pretty good growth this year as well.
In clothing and accessory stores, I know it shows 2% on year, we have seen a higher
number for Thursday and Friday, but when you look at Thursday and Monday
combined, the growth rates kind of went down to 2%, still positive, but it's somewhat
slowdown from what we saw on Thursday, Friday by itself.
So yeah, I think pretty robust growth across all categories of retail. And a lot along
the lines that we have seen last year as well.
What we did was before the broke down these growth rates for retail into e-
commerce and bricks and mortar. So to my earlier point, if you look at electronic
appliances, which is halfway through the slide, pretty similar growth rates both online
and brick and mortar, averaging or netting out at 16% across the board.
One of the interesting ones is general merchandise [ph]enure. These are stores
which are department stores are enure, discount stores are enure, and so on and so
forth. Lots of retail stores are enure in this category, we saw a big, big growth in
online and a lot being driven by Cyber Monday, speciﬁcally that we saw a lot online
growth in this speciﬁc category, but brick and mortar actually declined year-over-
year, so lesser foot traﬃc as it relates to general merchandise stores.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-05
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 8 of 19Mike SpriggsBut net-net came out at 1.3% positive, again, because the share of volume put in
brick and mortar and e-com, it's more weighted towards brick and mortar. Again,
across the board, pretty positive growth rates for e-com and brick and mortar across
all of these categories. Mike, is there anything you want to add to this?
{BIO 1772239 <GO>}
Yeah. The only thing that I would add here is to make sure that we consider these
numbers in context and of great interest is that general merchandise stores number.
Just like we have talked about in the earlier slides, we have seen that the volume --
and spend a little bit more spread out over the month. So when you look at these
growth rates, keep in mind that we're comparing against last year's performance for
the same timeframe.
So when we think about last year's performance, there was a kind of a diﬀerent
posture, diﬀerent mood certainly with how our merchants were going after
consumer activity. All right, there were these camp out 5:00 AM, 3:00 AM door
buster events that just didn't happen this year. But instead retailers invested in --
especially from the e-commerce side, a lot of activity leading up to the holiday as
well as in-store specials that we're not just saved for Black Friday, Cyber Monday
timeframe.
Also, we took a look at for both e-commerce and for brick and mortar. We took a
look at among all of the retail categories, which ones contributed the most to the
growth in each one of those formats. So as this slide will show you from an e-
commerce perspective of all the growth that we saw, that came in e-commerce
about 8.5% of that came just from building materials and garden supplies.
You'll see to the point that Rishi was making earlier, general merchandise stores
contributed a third of all of the retail e-commerce growth that we saw for the time
period. And sporting goods also had a great season, this season, and they
contributed a little bit more than a third to all of the growth in e-com. And brick and
mortar was a diﬀerent story, and I think this kind of helps us understand which format
customers choose depending on the -- depending on the categories that they want
to shop.
So what we'll see here is that, building materials, as you can assume by the nature of
the product that you're buying, this is more or less a brick and mortar kind of thing.
And it contributed close to 50% of all the brick and mortar growth that we saw.
Similarly, electronics and appliances, people buying large screen TVs or taking
advantage of kitchen appliance deals and things like that, obviously, that's a brick
and mortar thing. And so that's where most of the growth in brick and mortar came
from at least the third of it came through electronics and appliances.
We see that clothing and accessories, whether it was e-commerce or brick and
mortar, they contributed about the same between 5% and 6%. We know that
historically as we look at this particular category that weather plays a big, big deal,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-05
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 9 of 19Rishi Chhabra
Mike Spriggsbig, big part in its success. And we know with historically low temps for a long time
now, it's been hard to sell traditional, cool or cold weather clothing at this time a
year. And so the discounts being oﬀered sometimes come at the expense of sales
growth.
And then, you'll see other categories there. Interestingly, I'll point out here one thing
that you don't see on the brick and mortar slide, the chart is any evidence of general
merchandise retail growth, and that's because it actually trended negative during
this timeframe. Again, because of all the issues that we pointed out before.
Rishi, do you want to talk about some of the more geographic trends with regard to
retail?
Sure. And I think we have that in the next, next slide. So what we also did was
obviously, be[ph] process and we know where these all of our merchant clients are
allocated, so we can breakout this data by geography, both by states and regions.
So we took a kind of a regional view of growth rates. And pretty much across the
board, if you look at brick and mortar, this is brick and mortar only, and you look that
across the board for Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, every region had a pretty
strong robust growth, but though the West region outpaced the others, so we saw
6.3% growth for the Western region compared to 4.4 for the Southwest and so on
and so forth.
One thing to point out here in the Western region and the slide doesn't call out.
Speciﬁcally, we saw strong growth rates is in the Washington State for Thursday and
Friday, pretty strong growth rates there. And a lot driven in the Western region by
electronics and appliances against no surprises, no shockers, but the data attested to
what we thought is going to happen during the holiday season, and again, the
growth rates were pretty robust across the board, across all regions.
This one just gives you a view by state, again, you can see that pretty strong growth
rates by across most of the states in the U.S., and there are couple of states, which
are negative growth rates. A pretty strong positive growth rates Thursday through
Monday for all of the states in the U.S.. As I was saying before, the Washington State
had a pretty strong, you can see 10.2% [ph]year, which may be lower than 11.2 or 10.6
at some other state side, but it has slowed down Thursday through Monday, but
Thursday and Friday, I do recollect that Washington had a pretty strong growth rates
and outpaced all the other states in the U.S.. Anything you had [ph]sort of add to this
Mike?
{BIO 1772239 <GO>}
Yeah. I think that about covers it. I think you're right, Rishi in terms of what's driving
the growth on the West Coast, we deﬁnitely saw it coming from electronics andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-05
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 10 of 19Seema Shah
Mike Spriggs
Rishi Chhabra
Mike Spriggsappliances, there was pretty good activity within building materials and supplies
there.
Interestingly, historically speaking, the West Coast has kind of led the growth across
the U.S. this year in terms of where we're seeing growth coming from by region. And
certainly that held true for the holiday season. So yeah, you're right. Not a whole lot
of surprise here. And again, the states that we see trend negative on a state-by-state
basis has a lot more to do with perhaps what was happening from a weather
perspective during those time frames versus last holiday season, that has probably
more to do with that than any deﬁciencies within any of the categories that we track.
{BIO 18919310 <GO>}
Rishi and Mike, this is Seema, I just want to ask you about average ticket, what impact
that had on the numbers you're showing geographically or by category?
{BIO 1772239 <GO>}
Sure. Let's go (Multiple Speakers)
Yeah. You can speak to that.
{BIO 1772239 <GO>}
Okay. Yeah. So deﬁnitely average ticket plays a role. You might recall Rishi saying
earlier that, again with electronics and appliances, which seemed to kind of win the
season for this holiday season. When we looked at it just for Thursday, Black Friday,
when we isolated those two days and ran them against last year, we saw that there
was almost a $41 increase in the average ticket for the category.
As we look across the entire ﬁve day cycle, we know that Saturday and Sunday kind
of dampen the numbers and bring them back down a little bit closer in line with last
year's.
And so we see here that overall, there was about a 3% growth in average ticket, not
too much, but when you think about how that breaks out by category, we still see
pretty decent gap between this year's ﬁve-day window and last year for electronics
and appliances, for furniture and home furnishings.
We see that, because of the level of discounting and also the under performance in
traﬃc with general merchandise, we see that there is an instance where average
ticket actually came down just a little bit this year versus last year. So yes, average
ticket plays a big role in how these categories perform, especially when you have big
issue that we saw this year with traﬃc being compromised because stores wereFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-05

A - Rishi Chhabraclosed for a longer period of time this year versus their hours last year. Rishi, you
have anything to add to that?
I think you hit all the points. I think overall, the retail average ticket grew year-over-
year, and then a lot of the growth was driven to Mike's point by electronic and
appliances and some of the other categories. And again, this trend is similar to the
trend we have seen a year ago from a average ticket perspective.
{BIO 1772239 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Alright. Thank you very much. If you're done going through your slides, so you guys
ready for questions from the audience?
Yeah.
{BIO 1772239 <GO>}
Yeah, yeah. That's how we've prepared. Yeah, we're happy to take questions.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Excellent. So the ﬁrst question that we have is whether, you can speak a little bit
more regarding the weakness in the front half of the months, the most retailers have
actually talked about, and that time period leading up to the holidays, and what you
saw there?
We are happy to speak to that. So yeah, we did see, and I had a slide I think some
place, and we can just pull it up on my laptop here, but we did see the growth rates
for the ﬁrst half on November as well as the ﬁrst 21 days or 22 days leading into the
holiday season pretty sluggish, and that was across almost all of the retail categories
on a year-over-year basis. We were trying to see them any impacts of the election, if
something could come out because of that. One of the trends we did see, and this
was more on a week-over-week basis, so we looked at week-over-week for this
election period compared to week-over-week for the elections back in 2012.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-05
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 12 of 19A - Mike Spriggs
A - Poonam Goyal
A - Rishi ChhabraAnd we did notice that the week of the elections, I think that was November 8, if my
memory serves me right. That week compared to the week before, we did see some
ﬂat or negative growth rates, but that's pretty much bounced right back the week
after to the levels we have seen back in 2012.
So nothing in the 21 days leading up to the holiday season or the Thanksgiving was
unique in a way, because I think every year, we kind of looked at the November
trends for the last two or three years. And the trends look pretty similar from a
growth rate perspective, which were kind of ﬂat. If I recollect the mid-month
numbers for November, the ﬁrst 15 days, the growth rates from a year-over-year
perspective are pretty ﬂat or just slightly negative. And those trends were identical to
what we had seen from a year before.
So nothing again very unique this year versus last year. And again, this trend we've
been noticing for the last couple of years, which is the ﬁrst 20 days in November
tend to be slower. And I think that's go to the lot with people waiting for the deals or
the holidays to do lot of the shopping, and they hold back their spending towards
the end of November or the last week of November versus the ﬁrst three weeks into
November.
Mike, anything else you want to add to that?
{BIO 1772239 <GO>}
Yeah. No, I think you hit all the major points. You're right, the early part of November
was a little bit sluggish. And as we showed in that chart, I guess I'm going to ﬂip back
to it. As we showed in this chart, that looks at the week part at Thanksgiving is where
we see things start to pick up. So that helped improve the momentums into the
holiday. But prior to this, there were two to three weeks of pretty sluggish volume. So
that had an impact on the numbers that we see here, where we talk about, what was
the growth rate coming into the ﬁve day weekend. Does that answer your question?
Yeah.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Thank you. So we have one other question, another question from the audience. And
Rishi and Mike, we've spoken about this at [ph]length. In the data that you provide
us, you gave us spending or actually same-store sales year-over-year, ticket, traﬃc
and the growth rates. And for department stores, speciﬁcally, you mentioned that
general merchandise has contributed to online growth of which department store is
the component of. But tell us about the weakness that we're kind of seeing lately in
this category, what's driving it? How should we think about the category? And what
can you tell us to just help better understand the double-digit declines we've seen in
November from the department stores?
Yeah, Poonam. That's a great question. I know we've had this conversation separately
as well. I think the general merchandise as a category has a lot of, lot of stores in it.
It's got department stores, it's got discount stores, it's got other kinds of stores inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-05

A - Mike Spriggsthere. The trend you are talking about, Poonam has been -- we've seen the decline
happening over the last two, three, four months, and I think it's got exaggerated in
November. It's driven a lot by some of the department stores. Again, as -- we process
transactions, payment processing for millions of clients, and a lot of those retail
clients ﬁll -- or ﬁt up in that category.
So I can't take speciﬁc names for merchants or clients we process for, but overall, we
are seeing that category slow up, and it deﬁnitely did exaggerate in the month of
November. We saw that in the mid-month November, we saw end of month
November, you are seeing some of the numbers for Thursday through Monday, it's a
trend we have been seeing consistently.
Now some other trend move the other way from a online perspective, e-com, so
there is some good growth coming from online perspective, but again, I think
because so much of the volumes are heavily weighted towards brick and mortar, we
are deﬁnitely seeing slow traﬃc in that speciﬁc general merchandise category.
And I think it's pretty much across department stores, I also go back and check what
discount stores look like, but deﬁnitely department stores as a category or sub-
category within general merchandise. We are deﬁnitely seeing that slow down a lot
on a year-over-year basis.
{BIO 1772239 <GO>}
Yeah. I would add (Multiple Speakers). Go ahead.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Is that slowdown predominant, if you can just, I guess the questions that we're
getting is that slowdown is broad based, or it's more led by speciﬁc merchant from
the department store group? We should[ph] be look at as a broad based slowdown,
or is there speciﬁc outliers that may be driving this deceleration?
So I think it's more -- so deﬁnitely, it's a broad based slowdown. I think in general, the
category, we're seeing a slowdown, not exaggeration that you might be seeing in
some of the numbers recently in mid-month November, end-month November that
may be driven by some outliers from a merchant processing standpoint. But clearly
as a category, we are seeing a broad slowdown.
{BIO 1772239 <GO>}
Yeah, I would piggyback on that to say, I think Rishi is absolutely right, it's a
combination of those things. It's a broad slowdown, but then there are some players
in the market, who are signiﬁcantly underperforming their counterparts. As we look
at general merchandise stores, which includes value retail as an entire category,
within there, we'll see discount stores, department stores, other types of general
merchandise stores, variety stores things like that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-05

A - Jennifer BartashusAnd historically, department stores as a percent of that mega category of general
merchandise has hovered around 32%, 33% of that total number, that's -- as recently
as like the calendar year of 2015, as we look at it now, as we've kind of moved
through 2016, we see that, that percentage has dropped to about 25%, 26% of the
total. So it's struggling no doubt.
And to Rishi's other point, it is primarily a brick and mortar business, that is the
business model for department stores. When we look at e-commerce sales that can
be attributed to traditional department store merchants. We see that e-commerce
sales make up about 5% of the total volume. So clearly, they're not on pace with the
rest of their competitive set. And so that has bearing.
And then they're getting kind of kicked around the edges by a lot of newcomers to
the marketplace, they don't classify as traditional department stores. And who have
essentially an e-commerce oﬀering. And there is a whole host, those kinds of
shopping websites, where they just (inaudible) product every month, and you return
what you don't like. And that's really starting to wear away at some of these
department store merchants, who here for haven't really developed a coherent or a
compelling online strategy.
And I think when situations like this come up with the Black Friday or Cyber Monday
or things like that, and they're not -- their oﬀer is not as compelling. It really
exacerbates the weakness that we see.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
Thanks, Mike. We have the average ticket slide up there, and we talked about before
that the basically the only two categories that show increase was furniture and
electronic appliances.
Now looking at the category like general merchandise stores, we see a big drop
from $61 to $50 year-over-year. Now considering there is a lot of online transactions,
can you talk -- have you done any analysis on the average ticket between the e-
commerce to brick and mortar?
And then if we looked just at e-commerce year-over-year, do we see a increase or
decrease for that average ticket transaction?
{BIO 1772239 <GO>}
Yeah. That's, that -- let me let me look through what I've got here to see if I can
provide some commentary on that. We didn't have a slide prepared for that, but let
me see, if I can quickly while around on the call here do a little bit research to answer
that for you.

{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 18919310 <GO>}
I have a question, this is Seema. We -- I was just wondering, I mean, was there any
diﬀerence in store hours year-over-year for brick and Mortar, home-improvement
retailers and electronic appliance retailers and sort of related to that, do you have
any further detail on those categories? What categories and appliances and
electronics kind of drove the growth in the broader category?
Are you saying, sorry Seema, I just want me to understand your question, was your
question speciﬁc to the hours, that some of these retailers were open on
Thanksgiving? Or are you saying within electronic appliances, do we have further
breakdown or what's driving it or just want to make sure, I understand the question.
{BIO 18919310 <GO>}
Yeah. Actually both, so there is two questions. So the ﬁrst one is to understand, was
there any change in the store hours for the bricks and mortar retailers over this
period? And then --
Yeah.
{BIO 18919310 <GO>}
Like would do you have any granularity about which categories, which particular
items, TVs, refrigerators, what appliances actually drove?
Right, right. Okay. So got it. Yeah, so I think from a from -- going back to your ﬁrst
question, which is around the hours, I think one of the only things that really set out
from a hours perspective, I think, Mike and I hit upon this earlier in the presentation,
which is the hours, the retailers were open on Thanksgiving Day. Lot of the retailers
had opened shop much earlier in the day last year versus this (inaudible) 4:00 PM or
6:00 PM local time to kind of open up the shops, brick and mortar.
And I think that was across the board, across the categories. I think it wasn't, it didn't
stand up for one category versus the other, it was pretty much across the board thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-05
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 16 of 19A - Poonam Goyal
A - Rishi Chhabrawe saw that most of the locations, our store fronts opened up after 4:00PM or 6:00
PM local time.
I think the second question in terms of which sub-categories within electronics and
appliances? Clearly, we saw a robust growth in some of the products and software
services, or buying of software and hardware devices for sure from a computers,
tablets, laptops perspective.
No speciﬁc insight into what appliances were driving the growth or not driving the
growth. So whether that was a refrigerator versus a microwave oven and/or washer
dryer, so on and so forth. So we do not have insight into product level skew, because
lot of the data that we collect is on the total basket versus the individual components
of the basket.
So no speciﬁc insights into that, but we did notice that some of the merchants or
retailers classiﬁed as a software, especially the hardware stores had robust growth in
both on Thursday, Friday as well as Cyber Monday.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Alright. We have a couple of questions just regarding how you classify some of your
data. So can you let us know, whether your data contains dollar stores and how those
are categorized? Whether Wal-Mart and Target are classiﬁed as general merchants
or discount stores, whether it's like the Sears type stores, whether it's general
merchandise or department store. And then ﬁnally, with regard to private label, do
you -- do you continue -- do you have data that's generated from private label credit
cards and -- included in your data set?
Yeah. So I'll take all those. Yeah. So I think the classiﬁcations, obviously not taking any
speciﬁc client names and merchant names. The classiﬁcation of merchants clearly
depends on how we set them up when they start processing with us as a client. It's a
lot based on the category they belong to and what category they think they belong
to.
So I'll give an example, a Dollar store traditionally or should be what we would
categorize as a Discount store, if they were a client or merchant. And then Discount
stores could roll up or would roll up into general merchandise, the way we have
classiﬁed.
Wal-Mart or Target could be in many of -- could be in one speciﬁc category, could be
in multiple categories, depending how they've been set up. So their pharmacy could
be diﬀerent than their the general retail [ph]sellers or what have it. So I think it just
depends how they have been set up to begin with us from a processing standpoint,
and then we classify them into something what we call MCCs, Merchant Category
Codes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-05

A - Rishi Chhabra
A - Poonam GoyalAnd then we have 500 plus Merchant Category Codes that roll up into what we call
industry categories, that's what you guys are seeing on these slides. But all of these
categories are made up of bunch of Merchant Category Codes which are more
granular, and which kind of roll up into these speciﬁc categories.
So the clients can be classiﬁed one or many diﬀerent ways. Typically, they would be
classiﬁed the way you think they should be classiﬁed. But every now and then, we
could have a client who's classiﬁed slightly diﬀerently, either based on their
preference or based on where the majority of the business is from a dollar volume
standpoint.
I think to your last question, which is around private label cards, absolutely, we do
process private label cards. Lot of the private label card data should be in this data
set as well. Any kinds of electronic payments, whether it is credit card, debit card, gift
card, private label card, all of that should be in this data set. Assuming again, we
processed for that speciﬁc merchant, and if we do process, then we pretty much
process all kinds of electronic payments for that speciﬁc merchant or client.
{BIO 18919310 <GO>}
Rishi, this is Seema. I think we have time for one last question. Earlier in the
presentation, you talked about building materials, and how their growth over the
time period was 11.8%. I was wondering, if you could break that down for us with
traﬃc and ticket? I assume some of it is the ticket, because of the impliances[ph], but
if you have any more color that you could give us on that category over that time
period?
Yes, I think, I have to go back and Seema look at speciﬁc numbers, and I can follow
up with you after this presentation, but both average ticket saw an increase for home
stores, home furnishing stores, and then we also saw an increase in the number of
transactions, so the transactions count went up as well. So it's both driven by dollar
volume growth in average ticket as well as absolute number of transactions. What
the exact number was, I can send that to you after this presentation, if that's okay
with you.
{BIO 18919310 <GO>}
Yeah. That will be great. Thank you.
Absolutely.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
So thank you, Rishi and Mike. So just following up, were you able to get some clarity
on Jen's question earlier, regarding just the breakdown on a category level?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-05

Yeah, yeah. I -- with regard to average ticket, I think Jen's question was with regard to
average ticket. So I've done a little bit of investigation here. And I thought it would
be interesting to kind of give you a ﬂavor for how the average ticket varies or the
gap between brick and mortar and e-com for some of the larger categories.
So for example, we were just talking about building materials, and we see there, the
average ticket is roughly 87.46, I believe is but what we've shown on the slide. Well,
the decomposition of that shows us that in store brick and mortar average tickets
were roughly about $85 -- $85.41 is what our data shows, but the online portion,
those average tickets averaged about $126.02. So just kind of showing you the
diﬀerence in terms of the purchasing dynamics, brick and mortar versus e-com.
I'll give you another one for clothing and accessory stores, their average tickets were
more in line. Overall, when you add both brick and mortar and e-com together, we
saw that the average retail was $77.41.
If you look at it for just brick and mortar was $75.95. And if you looked at just e-com,
it was $86.67. And that's kind of play all the way through. Another one that I'll point
out is electronics and appliances, four to ﬁve day cycle ending on Cyber Monday or
just round an $150 average ticket in 2016 for the category, but if you broke that down
to brick and mortar and e-com, brick and mortar was $165, almost $166 in store
average tickets, whereas online consumers are spending roughly about $82.40 with
each transaction. So that kind of gives you a ﬂavor of I guess the spending dynamics
based on the format, it's being used to shop.
