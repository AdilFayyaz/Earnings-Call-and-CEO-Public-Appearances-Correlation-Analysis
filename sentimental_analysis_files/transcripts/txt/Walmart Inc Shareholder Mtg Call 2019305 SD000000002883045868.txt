Good morning. I'm Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. It's my pleasure and
privilege today to welcome you to the Walmart presentation at our conference. With
us today, from the company, we've got Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Oﬃcer. We've also got in the audience Steve Schmitt, who used to be
IR but is now Chief Financial Oﬃcer of Sam's; and Kary Brunner, who is IR from
Walmart. So thank you all for being here.
First, I'm going to reference the forward-looking statement to keep us honest and
keep the lawyers happy. So it's right there. The test on that will be the presentation.
Brett, thank you for being here.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Thank you.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Good morning. And we really appreciate Walmart being with us today.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Virtually everyone knows what Walmart does. But in light of the really exceptional
results that have been posted for the past several years, not everyone really
understands or appreciates how Walmart achieves those results. So unpacking the
wide array -- and there are a wide array of initiatives that underpin that and the
recent success is probably not possible in a short presentation like this. But let's justFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-05

Page 2 of 12A - Brett M. Biggs
Q - Beryl Bugatch
A - Brett M. Biggstalk about a few of those initiatives. And one of the ones that Doug referenced on
the call is -- and some time, is the increased training for Walmart U.S. associates.
What's been done? What remains to be done?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks. It's a good question. We get questions -- a lot of questions about wages.
And certainly, we've done a lot of -- we've made a lot of progress on wages in the
last few years. I'll start with wages just for a second.
So we go back to three years ago when -- back to October 2015, we came out and
said, we had to make some investments. And some of that was in eCommerce, some
of that was in the stores. And some of that was in wages. And if you look at our
average of fully burdened wage now, we're at about $17.50 in the U.S. And when you
look at full time, we're just under $20 an hour, when you look at 401(k) and bonus
and wages and everything that we pay. So we've made a big change in what we're
doing there. I think you see it in the stores. But the thing that gets -- I think gets
missed a lot about it is what we've put into training. So the last couple of years, we
opened 200 academies across the U.S. And even just last year, we trained over
450,000 associates in those academies. When you look at our U.S. management
force today, you've got about 75% of those people would have started as hourly
associates. We promoted well over 150,000 people last year. So we have jobs that
are allowing people to get into the workforce and continue to make progress on
their careers. You saw some of the technology that we're putting in place when you
came to Bentonville in June. And a lot of the technology is helping associates be
more eﬃcient. It's allowing them to spend more time with customers, which they like,
get them out of the back end, get them oﬀ the front end in some cases. And
spending more time with customers. And that's what the associates like. So I think if
you ask our associate base today, if you -- I know you spend a lot of time in our
stores. They would tell you what we've done from a training perspective has really
helped them serve customers. And I think it's showing up in our numbers.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Yes, Sam has said -- or Sam said when he was alive, that our people are the
diﬀerence. And that's really true. When you walked through Bentonville, we saw --
and some of the stores, we saw Bossa Nova, saw some of that training. I had a
conversation with an investor a few hours ago here at the conference. He said why
are they trying to replace the associates at the store. And I said, I don't think so. But
would love to hear your take on that.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. No. We're getting more productive in our stores. And through technology, we're
allowing associates to be more productive. And so what you've seen so far for the
most part in our stores is we've gotten more people out of the back end. Some of
those jobs have gone into shared services. And that's one of the things we've done
from a cost perspective, is put more eﬀort into shared services. We've gotten some
people oﬀ the front end. So more and more is being done through self-checkout.
And -- which our customers, they love self-checkout. They love Scan & Go with Sam's
Club so that's -- the customer wants that. But if you go into a Walmart store today,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 12Q - Beryl Bugatch
A - Brett M. Biggs
Q - Beryl Bugatch
A - Brett M. Biggsyou will see more people on the ﬂoor than you used to do to help the customers. So
I think it's a good balance of technology and people. And we believe, long term, that
the people are still going to be a big, big part of what customers want as they shop.
They're going to want to that human interaction. And I think Walmart is the company
that gives that, probably more than any of our competitors.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
So in the trading academies, do people go through it for a second time? What's the
second round of training? How often will an associate go through those academies?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. The academy, on the ﬁrst part, they go through the bigger part just once. But
then we have a program called Pathways, where we continue to give them training
through -- and depending on what they want to do, where they are in their careers.
And so we give them training throughout their careers. It's not just a one-shot and
move-on type training.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Okay. And when -- just stepping to another issue. Walmart's mantra has always been
saving people money. And that is embodied now in the slogan of save money and
live better. And Doug talks about that often. But he also says save busy families time,
now. So talk about some of the most notable initiatives that are going on to help the
Walmart customer save time as well as money.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. We think saving people money so they can live better is something's that's
going to last for a long, long time, it will last well beyond me because people want
to save money. And that's always been the case. We see that with millennials who are
just starting families. We see that with people that are a little older. We see it across
the spectrum. But time is becoming more and more of a precious asset. And I think,
raising hands of everybody in the room, you say, what's the thing that you thought
you have the least of, time is probably one of those things. So that's driven a lot of
what we've done in the last 2, 3, four years. If you look at what we've done in
eCommerce and the amount of investment we've put into that, we basically doubled
our eCommerce business over the last couple of years. Things like Online Grocery.
Online Grocery has been one of the -- I think one of the best things the company has
ever done from the standpoint of getting our brand known and thought about in a
diﬀerent way. The fact you can come and shop whenever you want to shop, come
pick it up in the store, our NPS scores are incredibly high. We'll have over 3,000
stores with Online Grocery by the end of this year. Now delivery, we'll have delivery
in over 1,500 locations by the end of this year. These are the kind of things that
people are looking for. And we're the largest grocer in the world. And we have over
4,500 stores in the U.S. This is what people are looking for. And the assets that we
have when you look at our store assets as well as our eCommerce assets. And I'd
throw in our ﬁnancial capabilities, I think it's unmatched in retail today, what we can
do to serve that customer in a way that allows them to shop however they want to.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-05

And what happens to the overall store when you add grocery to the eCommerce mix
or even pickup. Because that customer come in the store, do you get that additional
lift?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. They do some. We do -- think about even how my wife shops. She's use Online
Grocery for -- she needs 10 things. Sometimes she'll do it when she needs 50 things.
And her experience on Online Grocery has been fantastic. I think you hear this just
customer by customer by customer. But what it does is to develop a deeper loyalty
with our brand. And I think as people think about how they want to shop, it gets us
further and further on that search list in their minds of, well, I know I can get that at
Walmart. And it allows them then -- let's try Online Grocery. Let's try Walmart.com.
Let's go in the stores. So it may not be on that trip that where they go in the store.
But over time, it creates a loyalty. And we know, if we get people shopping online
and in the store, it's a multiple eﬀect of what people buy from us.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Okay. And what is delivery doing today? You started getting and expanding a little
bit. Could you talk about some of those initiatives as well?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. We're -- when you think about where the customer is going, I think delivery is a
place where you're, particularly when you're the largest grocer in the world that we
are, you're going to want to be in that space in a big way. I think longer term, are
people are going to want groceries delivered into the refrigerator. Are they going to
want you just to keep them in-stock at some point? I think the answer to that is
probably, there is some set of customers that is true. That's what they're going to
want. And delivery is one piece of that equation. But when it comes to winning in the
grocery space, we really want to be there for however that customer wants to shop:
store, delivery, pick up, eventually probably in your home, other things like that. We
want to be there for those occasions. And we think we'll win there long term.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
And now we're getting to the second and third year in some of the locations. What's
the comp experience in the -- and when you get through it and you start to
anniversary some of these locations?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Some of the early locations still continue to grow. We're seeing growth in Online
Grocery. That changes the nature of the store a little bit. You have more people
picking -- one of the side beneﬁts we've seen of stores that are really getting big in
Online Grocery is your measurement of in-stock gets even better. Your measurement
of being -- having that on the shelf. Because if you tell your customer you've got it,
you need to have it on the shelf so it can get picked. So we're getting better even, IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 12Q - Beryl Bugatch
A - Brett M. Biggsthink, in inventory management as we do this. We have some stores that have been, I
think, three years now in Online Grocery. And the good thing, too, though is we're
learning from those stores. As we get bigger and bigger, what you need to do from
an infrastructure standpoint, what you need to do from a labor standpoint, we're
getting more eﬃcient picking. You can then take those learnings and put those into
the stores and that are in their ﬁrst year so we cannot make some of the same
mistakes we've made as we -- as you typically would as you get bigger with
something like this. It's been fantastic and the stores absolutely love it. Associates
love it.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
One of the investor hot buttons. And we hear about it on every call, is the phrase,
Walmart invests in price. And your leadership -- or the leadership of the company
always says, we will continue to invest in price. So a lot of cross currents about that in
certain areas of the economy. We're seeing inﬂation in freight. And certainly other
commodities, those are issues. There are new eﬀorts in proprietary products that
carry some of that as well to allow you to keep some natural margins. Your 4.2%
comp and your 3.3% comp in price was interesting. And it created some controversy
as we got through the conference call and talking to investors afterwards, because
they thought maybe you were raising price. And how does that conﬂict with
investing in price? Maybe you can explain how that really is properly understood by
investors?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. We've always invested in that price. I've been with the company for 19 years.
We've always invested in price. We made a little more of a point of it three years ago
to say we're going to be a bit more aggressive. We like, for the most part, where our
price gaps are with competitors. And when we talk about investing in price, it's much
more strategic than it would've been when you would've ﬁrst started covering the
company or when I ﬁrst came to the company, in that by location, by competitor, by
category, it's very speciﬁc to what we want to do. And the merchants are doing what
the merchants have always done. And that's manage out margin mix. And the store.
And really even with eCommerce, is not that much diﬀerent. You have to manage
mix. And so there's some products that are going to be more price elastic than
others. And in places where you really want to drive home the point with the
customer and be competitive, you're going to be competitive in price. Grocery is an
interesting one -- or fresh food is an interesting one because we want to be the low
price leader in fresh food. But in a category like that, you have to be careful that
you're not too low priced if the customer trusts that it's high quality, because that's --
we need the customer to trust it's a high quality. Our quality is much better than it
was 3 or four years ago. And that's why you see mid-single-digit comps in food. But
that's an incredibly important part of what we do. But there's certain categories that
you just manage diﬀerently than others. And it's to make sure that the whole box
works. And we've talked about that even as we look at our total P&L, really, all the
way down to the P&L from sales to gross proﬁt to SG&A to operating income. There's
just all the things that we've got to balance to make sure at the bottom line that it
works for investors and it works for customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-05

And our -- your guidance for 2019 for U.S. is 2.5% to 3.5% comp for Walmart U.S. A
question that we get a lot of is, how do you think about that in terms of price versus
traﬃc? How is the right way to think about it? How do you think about it in terms of
price versus traﬃc?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Both are important. Comp is the thing that matters the most. And sometimes, it's
going to come in ticket. Sometimes, it's going to come in traﬃc, if you look over the
last two years or 2.5 years, I think, 2-year stats on traﬃc. So still good traﬃc coming
into the stores. Price is an important part of that. But I think just as equal in some
regard is what we come out with fresh quality. And what been done from a fresh
perspective, what we've done with technology to make it easier for our associates to
serve customers, all of that comes into play in that comp and price is a piece of it.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Okay. Since the tariﬀs have gone into eﬀect. And now there's some conversation
about what's going to happen to tariﬀs, have you noticed any change in the
competitive landscape since tariﬀs have gone to impact? And talk about the way you
think about tariﬀs. And I remember when -- in the early on time frame, it was not an
easy conversation about tariﬀs.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. It's one other piece of the equation as you think about pricing. That's for sure. I
don't think we've noticed anything dramatic in what competitors are doing. It still
feels like this conversation changes almost weekly externally about what's going to
happen from a tariﬀ perspective. We've said -- and we'd still say today, "We want to
be the low price leader." That is what we want to do. If we were to get to the types of
tariﬀs that were being discussed, it felt like more, seriously, 2 or three months ago,
you're going to have price increases in certain categories. We've had some tariﬀs on
products that the prices have increased, some on home side, bicycles would be an
example, where we've had some prices go up, just as our competitors have. But we
want to continue to be the low-price leader. And I think because of our ﬁnancial
strength, we can do that better than anyone else.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
And in terms of this year's guidance and thinking about gross margin, how should
we think about gross margin in terms of the inﬂation that we've impacted, the tariﬀs
and your investing in price? All of those had real speciﬁc factors of what happens to
gross margin.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It's a big equation and tariﬀs adds something into it that we don't see every year.
And our merchants -- I work with Steve Bratspies a lot on the U.S. side. Our
merchants are watching day by day, category by category. They've always beenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-05

A - Brett M. Biggsworking with suppliers on their own cost structure to make sure that we can continue
to -- for our customers together, give what's going to be a good price in the market.
But they're all over this. We've got to stay ﬂexible on how we manage this. And we'll
manage as we go along. But we're going to do everything we can to keep prices
where we want them to be. But we keep our investors in mind as well to do that.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
And you've been able to leverage operating expenses beautifully in the stores. Is
that going to continue?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Eight consecutive quarters in the U.S. stores of leverage -- certainly, you get
4.2% comp in the quarter helps a lot with leverage. But it's -- I said I've been with the
company 19 years. And I don't think we ever got away from our EDLC roots. But it
wasn't as strong as it has been in the past. What I sense, even in the last year, is a
change back to that. But it's diﬀerent. The DNA of EDLC is still there in a -- if you
were in our meetings now versus two years ago now, you would feel it. It would be
very tangible to you. But it's diﬀerent in the way in the past where it felt like there are
times where we'd say, we need to cut X amount. And we just go cut, cut, cut. It's not
eﬃcient. It comes back. And it's just not sustainable.
So the things that we're doing, what I would say now, are diﬀerent in that technology
is a big piece of it. Some technology didn't exist 3 and ﬁve years ago that allows us
to be eﬃcient in a diﬀerent way. We're being more surgical about how we think
about cost. And it's really more of let's change how we're working. Let's change
processes. Let's automate things in a way that take the cost out. So the cost
reduction ends up being the output, not necessarily the input, if that makes sense.
But that piece of it feels very diﬀerent. And what we started two years ago, we
started is what we called zero-based budgeting. But it's turned into what we call
smart spend now. It helped, I think, change the dynamic of how we think about costs
inside the company.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Well you're right. When you deliver like a 3.3% comp for a size of a company as
Walmart U.S., that's, what, about $11 billion, at least, in comparable sales. So I think
that does cover a lot of initiatives.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It does. It does.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Okay. Well an area that investors don't often talk about in settings like this is Sam's
Club. And Sam's Club, I think, has a near and dear place in your heart because...

Q - Beryl Bugatchthree years there.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
You ran the division -- I remember, in Sam's Club, leaving the ﬁnancial management
and coming back to it. So -- and last year was kind of momentous for Sam's Club.
You did some things that kind of got investors' eyebrows raised. You closed stores.
Talk a little bit about that. And I'll follow up with some other questions on Sam's.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I'm really proud of what's going on at Sam's. I think I spent three years there.
Doug spent several years there. So we both have an aﬃnity for Sam's. We sent Steve
Schmitt over there to be CFO. I think he's doing all right, he seems doing good.
John Furner's over there doing a great job with Sam's.
And what I like about Sam's is -- we kid sometimes that it's the smallest $60 billion
business in the world because of the size of Walmart. But they are trying a lot of new
things. Some of the technology initiatives that we've made really have started at
Sam's. Scan & Go started at Sam's. The test format that they have in Dallas was with
no checkout. Again, that's a Sam's initiative. And so it gives us an opportunity to try
some diﬀerent things. But if you're over in their building now. It just has a really good
buzz about it. It's exciting. The way they're working is diﬀerent. Membership, despite
closing the clubs that we did -- and that was tough but the right decision. Despite
that, membership is basically ﬂat. The number of members after closing 10% of our
clubs. So membership's doing really well. And that drives the whole business. But
our model, too, from a ﬁnancial standpoint is really back to what you want to look
like as a club business. So I'm really excited, not just about what they're doing. But I
think we're getting some learnings as well from what they're doing at Sam's.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
And on the merchandising side, you made the decision a couple of years ago to go
to one private label. Talk a little about the Member's Mark transition and what that...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. It's been great. When I was in operations in Sam's -- and that would have been
seven years ago now. We had I can't remember how many private labels. There were
a number of brands, more than 7, I'm going to say. So now with one, Member's Mark,
has become one of the biggest brands in the world now. And members like it. It's
easy for them to understand. You see it across the club. The quality is great. The price
is great. It's been a really smart initiative for what they've done. And I think it's
helped some of what we've done in Walmart as well. Private label penetration at
Walmart is up. And I think we learned some things from what they did at Sam's Club
or what we did at Sam's Club.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
You did allude to this a minute ago as being the smallest $60 billion business in the
world. And some investors wonder if Sam's is a vital part of Walmart going forward.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-05

Q - Beryl BugatchLet's talk about that. Is -- how do you think? How do you and Doug and the
leadership and the board think about that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, I think a lot it's what I just said. We're able to do some things at Sam's Club that
we can try and see how it works. And there's some things that we -- we, being --
when we say we, Walmart U.S., have learned from what we've done at Sam's Club
from a -- how do you serve members? What do you do with data? How do you
change processes? How do you deal with technology? It's been a great lab for the
company. And it's been a great place to have executives work and build the
business. Again, if you just go over and spend time at Sam's, there's a great energy
over there. It really does feel like it did 7 or eight years ago when I was there. I think
it's a really important part of Walmart. A great channel. It's been a great channel for
us.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
So let's move to International, which is another extraordinary part of that. And
management strongly has intimated that it is not committed to being in every market
in the world. I think the ﬁrst indication of that is when you actually did close down the
Russia oﬃce many years ago and then said, "Okay, we don't have to be in
everywhere." It only wants to be in strong...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I feel good about that decision.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
I think so. I can understand that. You wanted to be in strong and growing markets.
And so you divested some things. Talk a little bit about what the International looks
like.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, I spent half my career in International. So I feel a great aﬃnity for what's going
on there. We've made some decisions in International. We've been pretty explicit
about North America being the most important part of our business, the U.S.;
Canada; Mexico; Central America; China, being an important growth market for us;
and now India being an important growth market for us. But the other businesses
play an interesting role inside the portfolio and they generate cash. We learn things
from those businesses. And so they play an important part. But we've taken
decisions. We've taken decisions to sell most of our interest in Brazil. We have a
great partner in Advent in Brazil. You saw what we announced last year with the U.K..
And we're not -- certainly, we're not pleased with the provisional results that have
come out from there. And we'll continue to work through what that means. But I
think International will continue to play an important part of the business. But it will
be more focused.

Q - Beryl BugatchSo let's talk a little bit about that. Those are a couple of disquieting events that have
happened. We've got the issue of regulation in India. Can you explain to investors, a,
what happened? What does it mean to Walmart? How does that diﬀerentiate from
maybe some other companies there, I can't remember their name, that is also saying
they're investing in India. I'm not going to mention Amazon.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I appreciate that. Yes. You just did. That's okay. Yes. So India, I've been going to India
personally for, like, 15 years. I was -- I did one -- a part of the original joint venture we
did in India. So it's an interesting market. And the reasons we decided to make the
Flipkart investment are all still there. There's still 1.3 billion people in India. There's
still a growing middle class. E-commerce penetration is getting bigger in a very
rapid fashion. Really young population. All that is still there. When we -- when you
make an investment in India you know things are going to change. They did the ﬁrst
time we were in India. And they will again. We know that. We knew that going into
the investment. And you just got to work your way through it. And so we're going to
have real changes. We know that. We'll have legislation changes. We know that. And
you work your way through it. But long term, this is a great opportunity for Walmart.
Don't feel any diﬀerently than -- about it than I did six months ago. It's disappointing,
that you have a law like that change so quickly. But we've made the adjustments.
And we're moving forward.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Okay. And the other one you did reference a few minutes ago was the Asda,
Sainsbury issue and what the provisional ruling has been. When do we expect that to
get some ﬁnality? And what are the range of outcomes that we might expect?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Well they said they'll come down with a ruling in the next couple of months. So
we'll -- again, we're continuing to work on what we've heard from the provisional
ruling. And we'll go forward from here.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Okay. I realize how sensitive that is. And so I thought I'd ask and let you...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I appreciate it.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Okay. The last issue I want to talk about is one that's near and dear to a lot of
investors' hearts, particularly our investors across the pond. But increasing here is
ESG. And Walmart never gets enough credit for what it does as I think one of the
companies that does really good for its customers. But for its community. Talk a little
bit about some of that. And some of the things. And there are lots of initiatives, I
know.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-05

Yes. I'm really, really proud of what we do as a company. It's one of the great things
about working at Walmart is you can have an inﬂuence on the world while you're
able to have a big business like we do. I was actually in Europe last week and was
visiting with some people. Kathleen McLaughlin, who's our Chief Sustainability
Oﬃcer, visiting with some groups about our ESG eﬀorts. And we know it's becoming
more top of mind for investors. And a great thing for us is that's great for us because
we're really proud of what we're doing. When you look at even just yesterday,
announced that by 2025 that we would have all of our packaging in private label
recyclable. We announced, I think, last year, by 2025 that over half our energy would
come from renewable energy. And we're already a fair way towards that goal. In the
last ﬁve years now, I think more than 80% of the waste that comes out of our stores
doesn't go to a landﬁll anymore. We recycle that. There's just so many diﬀerent
things that we're doing primarily around food security, we're doing around women's
equality, what we're doing around carbon emissions and sustainability. We just got
rated the highest retailer -- I'm going blank with the name of the group right now
that just gave us (CEP), yes, that we were the highest-rated retail on ESG eﬀorts. So
we are glad to have this conversation, because I'm with you, I don't -- despite what
we try, we don't get the credit that we should get in this space. And when you look at
what we're doing around wages as well, I'm really, really proud to work for Walmart.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Okay. And just -- I guess, to end the presentation, let me just let you make an
advertisement to investors on why you think Walmart is such a compelling
investment.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I appreciate that. I do feel that way. And I said, I've been with the company 19 years.
I've seen a lot of changes. When I came to the company, people were saying, "I don't
know if Walmart can grow anymore," and we've more than tripled in size since then.
And there are a lot of opportunities in front of us then. And back then, it was
International as other things that we can do. But now when you look forward and you
see the opportunities that we have in eCommerce, the fact that we have all these
stores in the ground, I believe, is going to be a huge asset for us long term. And you
see other companies making decisions that would make you think as well that
having these stores in ground is going to be a huge asset for the company. So when
you look at the store base that we have, the associate engagement that we have, the
ﬁnancial strength that we have. And now what we're doing in eCommerce, it's really
a unique company. I'm biased, I admit that. I'm the Chief Financial Oﬃcer. But it is
really a unique proposition that there's really nothing we can't do, that we don't have
the assets and ﬁnancial strength to go do. We have got to be smart about it. We got
to be disciplined about it. And we will be. I think we have been. But I can't come up
with a company right now that has the assets that we have to go make a diﬀerence in
customers' lives. And I think that's what we're going to go do.

Thank you very much. We will continue this at the breakout.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-05
