Presentation
{BIO 1541955 <GO>}
We're going to get started, I think most of you in the room are very familiar with
Charles Holley, the CFO of Wal-Mart Stores. Charles has been in Walmart since 1994,
several diﬀerent roles including SVP, Finance and prior to that the CFO of the
international division. Before Walmart, Charles worked more than 10 years with
Tandy. He is also on the Dean's Advisory Board for McCombs Business School in
Austin and an active board member for the Cancer Challenge of Northwest
Arkansas. And Charles did me a huge favor, I could be -- he did me a huge favor
making room and scheduled to be here this year to do a ﬁreside chat format with me
for this lunch. And I know all you in the room appreciate that he did this for us. I also
want to thank Carol Schumacher, Head of Wal-Mart IR for making the trip here to
host meetings today as well.
So I'm going to just sit down and let Charles make some very brief intro comments
and we're going to jump right into Q&A.
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
Thanks, Robbie. And we're not doing you a favor while coming here. This has always
been a great conference. Why don't we ﬂip the slide to next slide, the (inaudible)
forward-looking statements. I'm not going to read it for you. But I do need to point it
out that anything I say could aﬀect your models and forecasting and you need to go
and look at all of our ﬁlings with the SEC as you're doing your analysis of the
Company. I will start a few brief comments. We have three big announcements.
Hopefully, you saw our earnings announcement. You can go to our website and get
that separate announcement obviously was rage announcement, which actually
encompassed several things, not just increasing minimum wage to $9 dollars and
$10 for next year also encompassed training and skills development for associates,
also adding back department managers into our stores which are viable and really
the core I think of our retail business and our stores. So that was a bigFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04

A - Robert Ohmesannouncement for us and that then be about a $1 billion investment this year is $0.20
a share. Then the last thing is the dividend. We didn't talk a lot about that. I think it
kind of got put under. But that's our 42nd year of an increase dividend and, which
we're very proud of the $1.96 per share versus a $1.88 last year. So with that, we kind
of open it up for questions.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1541955 <GO>}
Great. I'll start oﬀ with the ﬁrst question. Can you actually help the risk value. I feel
like I have to do this sometimes with people. Can you remind all of us who the core
Wal-Mart customer is and where that customer may be similar or diﬀerent versus an
Amazon or a target or even a Costco, because it's not entirely the same customer.
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
Maybe I'll break it down this way. First of all, we serve all of the US -- all US
customers. But we tend to index higher than most retailers at the income that would
be below 50,000. We would index much higher than other retailers. When you look
at incomes of above 100,000, you would see that we would probably index less than
some of those other retailers, probably may be 10%. What's key I think for us is most
of the majority of our customers two-thirds at least are really value driven and that's
always been the case and that's why everyday low prices have been so important for
us.
{BIO 1541955 <GO>}
And are there any diﬀerences in sort of preferred method of payment for your
customers versus --
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
Yes. But you hadn't changed the loss that's since 2008 in the ﬁnancial crisis where
we saw our credit come down and that was I think you saw that everywhere. Credit is
actually not the major part of our -- of what we are using at the register. Debit card
continues to be increasing and then cash obviously and it's kind of interesting I think
is that you see with mobile and where mobiles going to mobile payment. I think
that's deﬁnitely where the future is going to be going for our customer. How that all
plays out. I don't think anybody knows yet. But we do know that's -- and whether it's
going to be an Apple Pay or a currency which is a consortium of retailers or
something that the Android devices do. It's going to be some combination of that
thing.
{BIO 1541955 <GO>}
And sort of question you're getting all the time. Gas prices, can you just remind us
the historical impact from gas prices and I think you guys used to do customer exit
surveys. Do you still do that in any sort of --FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04

A - Robert Ohmes{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
No. We stopped doing those customer surveys this past year. The reason why it
didn't really change a lot. I mean the top of mind for customers towards gasoline,
healthcare, cost of living and job and maybe they with one, two and three shifted
slightly depending on what was the topic this year was and we felt like those are
pretty consistent and those are not going to change. But (inaudible) further question.
{BIO 1541955 <GO>}
I'll just the historical impact from year-over-year gas price declines in --
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
Yes, I mean obviously in the Fourth Quarter there is a very large impact I think on the
business and especially in a positive way with our core customer, which would again
be where we would index higher to lower income, because a lot of those customers
aren't going to have 41-K plans. They're living paycheck to paycheck and when gas
prices came down that's like an instant raise for them and they have actually more
cash in the wallet more and more to spend.
Now I've seen questions on our surveys on where that money went, a lot of
economists believe a lot of it went to savings. But I think with our customer, what
we've seen is some portion they did use for saving, some wants to pay down debt.
But they also use the portion to acquire food. Food was one of the top item that's
what they use that savings for.
{BIO 1541955 <GO>}
I think we're going to have Greg Foran who is going to be here in New York in April.
April First, can you give us any insights are previews ahead what he might say that
might be diﬀerent from a former heads of Wal-Mart US?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
I think pretty consistent with what you might have heard from Greg in the early days
in October at the Investor Conference, he's got -- he is very focused on the core
business right now and making sure that we optimize everything we have that would
include inventory. I was talking to somebody earlier, inventory, you saw us have a
very good result in the Fourth Quarter and that was for the Company and that was
led by Wal-Mart US and that's been a focus of Greg's. I think there is more to be had
with inventory. But it doesn't play out just in your working capital, it plays out on
many lines of the P&L, whether it's shrink, whether it's marked down, whether it's a
labor handling that inventory. That's a major focus of his. Another one, you probably
hear is fresh, very focused on the fresh part of the business.
{BIO 1541955 <GO>}
Now, Doug McMillon has talked about the importance of driving same-store sales,
other CEOs of Wal-Mart are talking about the importance of that. Is there any way we
should think diﬀerently about the drivers to that in terms of -- they said priceFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04

A - Charles Holleyinvestment. Are there -- is there more emphasis on changing the merchandising of
the Wal-Mart US stores or marketing changes or?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
I think you could break it down into four distinct areas that are -- that we're very
focused on right now, price, assortment, access and service. And if you look at price
that -- I think that's kind of for a mass merchant, that's just become the ticket entry
and with a customer and you have to have great prices and we will always be
focused on that, that's kind of a core foundation you have to have. Assortment, the
supercenter has brought 120,000 SKUs to a customer and I think now with the
advent of eCommerce and what we're doing with fulﬁllment centers. We want to
give out our access (inaudible) where you have hundreds of thousands of items that
the customer might be able access at that store within an hour or two. I think that's
where you're headed with this and very important. So assortment even though
120,000 seems like a lot. I think that assortment with online and what you can do
with it, just add so much more for the customer and then beyond that you're adding
millions of more items we'll end up with well over 10 million SKUs online by the end
of this year. Then access and experience may kind of overlap. How the customer
wants to access whether it's ordering or the ordering online on mobile, how they
pick it up, what the experiences online and mobile, what the experience in the
stores, is still very important and that's why you saw the $1 billion investment, we felt
like that was very key to making sure that we have the kind of experience we want
our customers to have. So those four items I think are going to be a very big focus
for us, especially Greg and his team.
{BIO 1541955 <GO>}
In the Fourth Quarter, your traﬃc comps rose I think it was 1.3% or 1.4% positive for
the ﬁrst time in nine quarters I think. Can you give us a little more insight on where
that traﬃc improvement came from and also was there any spread between rural
markets versus urban or suburban or --
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
Yes. It's primarily you saw the biggest improvement in traﬃc in the rural stores. And I
think you can tie that to the cost of gasoline for our customers. I don't think the
customer sits down and gross out the cost of gas is going down I'm going to drive
more, they just inherently know they have more disposable income they can use on
gasoline or they go into the store, where they go into the store. So we deﬁnitely saw
large pickup in trips in the rural stores and that requires more driving.
{BIO 1541955 <GO>}
(inaudible) with this team called the apparel (inaudible) but your apparel business in
your home categories have been I think a lot stronger than other retailers especially
more recently, what do you think the strategies are what are the two or three things
in those categories you could point us to.

Page 5 of 13A - Robert Ohmes

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Charles HolleyWe also talked about that earlier. I think that we probably win a little too far three or
four years ago as you know, Robbie, with some of the fashion apparel that we had,
what we're really good at, we're good at basically even if it's active wear. And I think
that is continued and US continue to see that momentum this year. We had negative
comps and apparel for a number of years until the last year or so and I would expect
that to continue the positive comps. A lot of good things, lot of good brands we're
bringing in and it's just -- I did a really good job I think with our assortment there.
{BIO 1541955 <GO>}
Making sure there's no question from the audience. Can you talk about the gross
margin outlook for Wal-Mart in the context of being the low price leader and how we
should think about that over the next three to ﬁve years?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
I don't think that it depends on the category you're talking about obviously and what
you're looking at. We don't have a grand plan to drive down gross margins. But at
the same time, we want to make sure our pricing is as sharp as possible in the
market and that we're the low price leader in the market. So there is no plan to get it
up high, there's no plan to drive it down quickly low. I think the market will dictate a
lot of that. But we know that being a low price leader demands spread between us
and some of our competitors. So we will continue to monitor that. We'll work with
our suppliers are being more eﬃcient. But also we use private label where
appropriate. So we think that there is a good value -- that there is not a good value
for consumers and being able to use the market side is that the great value brand if
you get a question back there.
So if you can talk to us a little bit about the strategy in food. You mentioned fresh is a
key focus but also you acquired the Waldo's brands and it seems like you want to do
more in the organic debate, can you just talk to us about how you see the focus on
fresh and natural organic for Wal-Mart playing out over the next few years? It seems
like at this point not much happened frankly with the Waldo's, maybe just its prices.
I'm just curious to understand what that trajectory will look like?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
Yes. It's still rolling out and diﬀerent products with the Waldo at the store. But
beyond just the Waldo, it's one of the things we know is that over 90% of our
customers would like access to organic sustainable products in the food area if they
are aﬀordable. So are not really necessary to pay a high premium all the time, or at
least core customers are not. And so that's the challenge for us to making sure that
we can source. So we should be able to do a lot of that with our size, to lever our size
but sourced sustainable organic products for our customer. And as far as the fresh
areas is pretty obvious, you've got a lot of great fresh area if you're in the food
business. But we also know -- we've got to do a better job in our daily areas and our
bakery areas or meat areas all the critical. I think we've upgraded some of those. But
I think they have a longer way to go. We need to -- not just satisﬁed customer day.
We should be exceeding some of those. But I think Greg is very focused on that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04

A - Charles HolleyI chose -- I know Canada is not a (inaudible) part of your business. But I -- one of the
thoughts on what your interest in the potential target leases that are up for progress
133 of them do most of those make sense for Wal-Mart or we should focused mostly
on the ones that do not have food restriction. But another grocery store in the same
mall as a target?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
I couldn't speak speciﬁcally on any one lease and we evaluate those in accordance
with what our strategy is. Food is a big part of our strategy. So I wouldn't think that at
least it doesn't have to permitting would be real exciting for us right now and as far
as Canada is concerned. But I will say, we're very pleased with our Canadian
operations where they are. They had one of the better years this last year. Very good
proﬁtability and their sales were very good. The food business continues to be on
the uptick.
I had a question, a follow-up on Wal-Mart giving more to natural organic, as you guys
(inaudible) getting more into the space. Is there enough supply out there in the US
too. Basically have some of those jump in the pool with enough water in the pool. I
mean, we're hearing about strength on these for a while for organic milk. If I buy
organic (inaudible) I guess we need to have organic milk. So it's kind of like within
even though raw inputs, have you guys done the work (inaudible) --
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
I can't answer your question for the short term, other than tell you that, I think it takes
working with suppliers over a period of time to order to lever the quantity to get the
price down with aﬀordable for our core customer. But I do think that most of the
products that we sell to go a long way with sustainability organic by work with our
suppliers. But it takes a volume and it takes planning and we do work with our
suppliers on that.
Hi Charles. Two part question I guess. Greg focus on the inventory, I was a little
surprised to hear that given there is still some issues without stock in the stores. And
secondly and relatedly as part of the announced last week, where the store hours
has been an increased allocation?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
Yes. We increased the hours in the Fourth Quarter for our cashiers. So that continues
right now. And as far as the inventory, you don't necessarily equate, carefully equate
the other stocks with having high inventory level. What that tells you, you're an
eﬃcient and we had our backrooms will backed up. And that is where Greg has been
focused and you saw that, we had the best inventory working capital performance inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantthe Fourth Quarter I think that we had in four years. And I was extremely proud of our
teams, especially in the US on that.
What happen with the labor hours to get that done?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
I don't know, that we change dramatically the labor hours. But I think we looked at
what the department managers were doing and I think we could have over
engineered a little bit of those department managers. One of the things we're doing
in the billion dollar investment by the way is adding back some of the department
managers that we're taking out and I think that will also help with in-stock.
We talked about gross margin, talked about wages. You've got investment in e-
commerce. One of the questions, I always get recommending Walmart is, what do
you think about this sustainability of the near 6% type EBIT margin you guys have?
How should I think about answering that question to investors?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
I think your question is -- I think is can you sustain that long term? I think yes we can.
We are making as you know some investments in the mid-term and e-commerce that
we think are critical for our business and for our customer and need to be -- continue
to be relevant for our customer. And those will last for a couple of years that the
major investments. But we still have a lot of opportunity for proﬁtability in
international. Sam's Club is in the investment mode that they will come out of this
year. So yes, I think overall long-term we feel further comfortable about the
operating margin.
Can we get Walmart's update on port congestion and what it means for your
Company?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
Yes. We're glad that it's getting to an end. But it's going to take a while to unclog the
port. I think the bigger issues are the seasonal. But this isn't new to us, this is
something that if you followed retail for any length of time you know it's happened
before as where they have port strikes and so we do have a pretty comprehensive
import plan that we've always executed and it doesn't rely just on the West Coast. So
I think we've minimized it as well as any other retailer out there. Having said that,
there are still some issues we're ironing out even as they come oﬀ the strike. That will
aﬀect mainly seasonal.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Charles HolleyHi, just two quick questions. (inaudible) next. Just two quick questions. First is on
Snap. I think you'd called out in the Fourth Quarter that you now cycled some of the
snap pullbacks and I'm wondering if you're seeing that -- if you're see that customer
-- how you're able to disaggregate between what the lower gas price impact is on
that customer versus the cycling of this Snap curtailment? And my second question
is unrelated, this relates to the savings Catcher app that has been an incredible
success from what I can tell and I'm wondering if you have an updated a number of
sign ups I think in that 5 million people when you discussed that at the Analyst Day
back in October?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
I don't have an updated number. But I tell you what Greg point is here April 1 to
Carol assured and get that it's been incredible success and it’s; if you don't have
one, you should have one, you're losing money if you don't. Then your other one is
on snap, one of the things you have to remember about snap, which we cycled
through November 1 is we don't like a ﬂip, it wasn't like you got the money back, you
still have less money in the market from snap a year or later and so I'm not sure that
had a huge impact on comp. I think fuel prices deﬁnitely had an impact on comp.
You talked about the key drivers of your improvements in apparel. But you also
mentioned home. Can you drill down similarly there outlined, what changes you
made and as you look forward how you intend to do more?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
I think at home, I think at brands if you look at what we've been able to do in the last
two years with brands and home and then give real value to like the Lenin section
and whatnot. But brands and just product development in some of the areas where
brands may not be as important to give real value.
Charles its tax refund season, I think you guys have a new program direct to cash.
Can you just sort of remind us what the changes versus how you usually would
handle that and what you're seeing in tax refunds?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
The biggest change really from the last two years is that the higher risk and
processing refunds is ﬁnally back to more of a normal cycle. In the last two years, it
was delayed. In fact two years ago, it delayed several weeks back six weeks. And we
see like we've never caught back up and then last year it was delayed. I want to say
three weeks or four weeks. This year is a much normal cycle. We were able to pick up
back on that. We try to make it as easy as possible with our tax partners for the
customer to get the refund. Then of course we'd like to stay (inaudible) at the store.
But I think the biggest issue was just getting their refund sooner than later in the last
two years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Charles HolleyIt's Schmidt (inaudible) lot of your competitors have loyalty programs, some of them
are here talking about it and developmental loyalty programs and interaction with
mobile devices and things. What do you think makes sense for Wal-Mart to do there?
What are some of the things you guys are working on?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
I think I actually think savings catcher is a great example. We know that we're
competing against companies that use a high-low tactics to try to get bring in a
customer and that's just not what we want to do with everyday low price. We're not
real big on couponing as you know but we have to compete with that and I think
your loyalty comes from at least ahead for us historically oﬀering that very low price,
every day and having a savings cash to guarantee that the customer always get that
low price. I don't think you can get much better loyalty in that. But that's been proven
as we build out the program.
Hi, Charles. The international portfolio, if there any updates you can give us this to
how you're thinking about long-term. I know you know there's a lot of debate
around the future of China for example and we've built in to be permanently messy -
- I guess I'm wondering like how do you think about return on investment and
hurdles that have to be met and time horizon for various markets?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
Yes, let me. But maybe it's the best thing to do is to give you a little quick view of the
major operations international and what we think. I'll start with the UK, very solid
operation. Many of you've been out there and seeing that another management very
tough market economically right now. This is going to be a value to a very tough
year for the whole UK market. Having said that, I think that we have the strongest
operation of the four large retailers. But make no mistake, it'll be very tough for them
this year. But they are very experienced in dealing with some of these things. So
we're very conﬁdent that they'll do very well. They'll do as good as anybody can -- of
the big retailers.
Canada spoke about. We're very excited about the momentum that they continue to
have especially the food business. China, a little bit of a misnomer for some reason
we make money in China and we have for while working where we didn't is when we
went in with items like restructuring the stores.
Like what we did the year before last, which was very critical for us, we needed to
create the platform where we can grow and feel good about that growth. In China,
our best quality in the world in China. Our best Sam's Club in China, Shenzhen. And
it's actually our very ﬁrst club in Shenzhen. We didn't open up enough crops for lots
of reasons early out now that's changed. We're very focused on getting those clubs
open, if you look at the Wal-Mart supercenters, we have ﬂag plan a little bit too much
about all the provinces and we pulled back that with the restructuring was about aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Charles Holleyyear and a half ago, we pulled back so that we really focused on the southern part of
China and the middle part of China, where we're very successful. We have some
incredibly good super centers that have very high operating margins and so we want
to leverage the core that we have there. In addition, we didn't have a centralized
supply chain, which has been very critical to Wal-Mart's success around the world.
We are now installing that and we think that will make a big diﬀerence. So we're very
bullish on China going forward. Brazil still is a work in process or we better than we
were a year ago. Yes or we anywhere near we want to be. No. We're not. We still
need to integrate the three operations we have there. We also are still trying to get
our hands around to make sure we can operate proﬁtably and eﬀectively and the tax
on the labor environment they have there. It's very diﬃcult, not unique to us, all the
companies deal with it, just a very diﬃcult working environment. Then Mexico, we're
very pleased with what our self-service formats have been doing except for Sam's
Club as you may know. But that is actually improved over the last 12 months. We
have a new management team at Sam's. We brought down the head operator at
Sam's Club US is now over the Sam's Club in Mexico. We're seeing deﬁnite
improvement, very excited about where we're going with Mexico.
So that gives you little ﬂavor of the major operations and as far as just portfolio we
don't -- we're constantly as we always have looking the portfolio. But right now very
focused, very similar to the US, get the comps, back where you want them, just to
have a very good operating environment in your stores for your customers.
Okay. Any thoughts on when China’s same store traﬃc is going to turn positive and
what's kind of the strategic plan for (inaudible) there?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
It's good question. As you know, China has been going through an austerity
program and everybody's been feeling the eﬀect all retailers including us. And I
think we've actually been better oﬀ than most retailers do that. But to your question
of when I don't want to forecast when comps are going to go positive. But I would
certainly help that you would see some of that this year as you cycle through some of
this austerity programs.
Hi, Charles, the neighborhood market comps were I thought they were pretty
impressive in the Fourth Quarter at 7.7%. Can you help us understand the
outperformance of the strength of those comps versus I don't think grocery in the
supercenters was a standout category in terms of comp and --
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
I would -- the biggest question for Greg in April. But I really think a lot of it has to do
with convenience. If you think about our history in the US with super centers, they do
very well and always have with stock up trip of our customer, where they get
everything they need. But what's happened with the US consumer over the last few
years is about convenience also and we haven't had the alternative for the customerFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04

A - Charles Holleyof convenience and I think it's a huge upside for us and as we, it complements the
supercenter and they take out the neighborhood markets take a little longer to
mature into the supercenters. The ﬁrst three years are very high comps, it takes a
little while to get that customer attachment, lot of it happens through pharmacy and
the (inaudible) that you have. But I think a lot of it has do, you're looking at a lot of
new neighborhood markets who're still in growth phase in the ﬁrst three years.
The return on invested capital from International has been a little disappointing. And
now that you starting these ventures in e-commerce, I just wonder why it would be
diﬀerent? Could you just talk about the competitive advantages you have with
Amazon. Why this eﬀort will turn out better than the last one?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
Well I don't think there is same. First of all, one was about going into public new
markets and trying to transfer what you had and we have that success. We have a
very strong business in Canada, high returns same with Mexico. The UK's been pretty
good actually. We would like better returns obviously and by the way we're
proﬁtable in China and have returns there and then Japan. For those I wouldn't call it
as disappointing and maybe there are some in South America, like the Brazil and
Argentina, God grant you that. I think the (inaudible) to stay relevant with the
customer, you have to make investments and we are operating for the long-term, not
the short-term. And I think it's critical as a Company that we continue to evolve and
test new things. I think it's also critical to know when quit test and also went to
accelerate something. But never good markets went for a long time as a test and the
reason why is the supercenter if you do so well. But when it is ready then we started
really ramping back up. So I think this integration of ﬁscal and digital gives us a huge
advantage over just a pure.com play and how lever that. There are a lot of our
markets, majority of our markets are very drive type markets, look at Dallas-Fort
Worth Houston or whatever. You know, where customers are going to drive and
being able to make that as eﬃcient as possible, whether it's a pickup point or pickup
in the store, I think is going to be a huge advantage for us and it's really important
for us to ﬁgure these things out to how to do it well. So that you have an advantage
over your customers, you have something that's convenience. I think it's about
convenience by the way, that you could oﬀer your customer.
There is a lot going on in the world of how customers are evolving the way they pay
for stuﬀ. You know Apple Pay et cetera. Also you guys have done things with like
banking type things like Green Dot. Can you help us sort of what should we focus
on, what is Wal-Mart focused on areas of pay and turn of the banking products and
things.
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
I think there is three things in my mind that are going to be important. And like I said,
I think it is shifting towards mobile pay. It's just not clear where exactly is shifting and
we need to make sure we're prepared to be a more of the leading edge of thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04

A - Charles Holleywhen it happens and we're talking to most of the players. We're trying to ﬁgure with
these players and partnerships and even in our own apps that we might have. But it
needs to be convenient for the customer, it needs to be safe and secure and it needs
to be at a low cost. Those are three really important factors that we look at when we
assess on mobile payment and if you can conﬁgure those things out, then I think
that's what's going to win.
On this sort of alternative banking product side, I know there's been some
announcements related that like Green Dot et cetera in the past. Any update on that
side?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
No. I mean we continue to drive products that will help the customer that doesn't
may be have access to traditional checking account and you've got that Green Dot
now, you have that with American Express for their product. And we have Blue Bird
that gives access to customers that just can't get a bank account. But it gives them
access to some sort of a checking account, some sort of debit cards, some sort of
credit card. I think that's really important for a certain part of our customer base.
{BIO 1541955 <GO>}
We have time for one more question if there is one.
How would you agree Sam's Club performance particularly with the comp spread
versus Costco. We don't get to see your membership fee. But I guess I am just
wondering like these things that it's in a good position where it is today?
{BIO 18024865 <GO>}
Yes, I don't know that you can -- there are both club channels. But those models are a
little bit diﬀerent. So it's hard to grade one with the other. Costco is a fantastic
wholesale operation. I think what Sam's Club is doing with the plus memberships
has been very good. We're still going through a lot of -- using a lot of cost into that
cycling through it. But it's proven that it's been very good for our renewals and
upgrading of memberships what Sam's is doing in merchandise side, you're going
to hear more about that from Ros probably at the shareholder meeting and get
updates for what's she's doing there. Very solid business has very good returns and
if you follow the returns they're very high for that channel. So we feel very good
about the Club business. I think merchandise is going to be key though in driving
that business forward.

Terriﬁc. I want to thank Charles for doing this one [ph] with us today.
