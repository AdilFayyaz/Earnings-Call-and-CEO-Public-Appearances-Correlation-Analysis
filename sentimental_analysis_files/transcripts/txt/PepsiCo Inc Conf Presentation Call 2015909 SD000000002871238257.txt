Presentation
{BIO 16594232 <GO>}
I think we'll get started with the next presentation. Good morning, everybody. We're
delighted to be joined today by Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial
Oﬃcer of PepsiCo; as well as the Head of Europe Sub-Saharan Africa, Ramon
Laguarta; and Frito-Lay North America, Tom Greco.
Hugh Johnston has been with PepsiCo for 28 years and CFO for more than ﬁve
years. In addition to his responsibilities as CFO, Hugh was recently named Vice
Chairman and also oversees Quaker Foods North America, Global e-Commerce.
And Global Business and Information Solutions. We look forward to hearing Hugh's
perspective on the business and Ramon and Tom's take on their respective
businesses. Without much further ado, I'll hand it over to Hugh.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, with me today are Tom
Greco, who leads Frito-Lay; Ramon Laguarta, who leads Europe Sub-Saharan Africa;
and Jamie Caulﬁeld, of course known to you all, our Head of Investor Relations.
Before I begin the presentation, I want to start with the safe harbor statement. I'll
allow you 15 seconds to read this. But it is available on our website as well. Okay.
First, I want to begin a little bit with just a quick snapshot of PepsiCo's ﬁnancials; a
reminder, really, for you all of who we are and how were performing. I want to just
make ﬁve very simple points here.
Number one, we're large. At $66 billion, we're the number-two food and beverage
company across the globe and that comports to us tremendous scale advantages.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 2 of 14Number two, we're growing. Over the last three years, our organic revenue growth
has been 4%. That puts in the top tier of consumer products companies.
Number three, we manage costs and margins well. Our core operating margin at the
end of last year was 15.5% and that's up 70 basis points over the last three years.
Number four, we use capital eﬃciently. Our net ROIC is 17.5%. That's up more than
200 basis points since 2012.
And number ﬁve, we're cash-focused. Our businesses are big cash generators and
that enables us to both deliver a yield today of approximately 3% and a healthy
share repurchase program. In fact, over the last 10 years, we've delivered $63 billion
back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase.
The strong cash return is really driven by a high focus on cash ﬂow. Over the last
three years, as well, our free cash ﬂow productivity, deﬁned as free cash ﬂow over net
income, has been 120%. We've made terriﬁc progress both in managing working
capital and in managing our capital expenditures tightly.
So we think these ﬁve factors basically show that we have been very, very
shareholder value-creation oriented and, as a company, we intend to continue to do
so. What I'll show you over the course of the next couple of slides is why we think
we're well-positioned to do so. Then we'll do two deep dives this morning; one on
the Europe Sub-Saharan Africa business and then, second, on the Frito-Lay business.
What are the advantages that we bring that we think we can sustain the value
creation? Number one, it's our brands. We've got 22 brands of $1 billion of retail
sales or more. And in addition to that, we've got 40 brands, a subset of which is
shown up here, which are up and coming brands between $250 million and $1
billion, some of which we certainly expect will pass by the $1 billion mark over the
course of the next few years.
The second structural advantage is we play in strong categories. Both food,
convenient food and beverage are about 50-50 in terms of the mix of products
across the business or the mix of revenue across the business. About 20% of that is
health and wellness, which, obviously, is quite an on-trend category. These
categories are also quite complementary. They work well together. They're impulse-
driven. They're brand-driven. They have the same customers. They have the same
consumers. And they tend to get consumed often in the same moments.
Third structural advantage is geographic mix. Our geographic mix is truly global in
nature. A little over a third of the business is in faster growing, developing. And
emerging markets. Two-thirds of the business is in strong, steady, developed
markets.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 14That geographic balance does create something of a natural hedge for us. It's not a
perfect hedge by any stretch of the imagination. But, as economic events come
across the globe, such as lower energy prices that we're seeing right now; in some
of our markets that's a negative to consumers. In others of our markets lower energy
prices are a positive to consumers. It tends to balance out reasonably well in the
portfolio.
Organizationally, we're set up in six segments. As you can see on the chart, the
largest developed market is North America at 56% of our total revenue. Second
largest is Europe at 20% of our total revenue. Latin America is about 14% and
AMENA is about 10%. The margins range from low double digits all the way up to
the high 20s% and that's basically reﬂective of two things. One is just the market mix
inside of a particular region and number two is the business model mix, whether
we're in a concentrate model or a full-bottling model or an operational model as we
are in snacks.
The speakers that I'm here with today, Tom and Ramon, represent about 40% of the
revenue of the Company and represent about half the proﬁtability of the Company.
So their deep dives, I think, will give you a good sense as to why we believe we can
continue to do what we've been doing.
In addition to the structural advantages, we're focused on ﬁve priorities. These are
not new. These are the things that we've been focusing on, really, over the last
several years. First, brand building. Second, innovation. Third, execution. Four,
productivity. And ﬁfth, driving cash returns, converting all of that to cash returns,
which get back to the shareholders. We're pleased with the progress we'll be
making in that regard and we expect to continue to do so.
If you take it together, the structural advantages and the execution against these
priorities has resulted in consistently strong ﬁnancial performance over the last three
years. We've either consistently met or exceeded all of our long-term goals as we've
laid out here. We've been generating mid-single-digit revenue growth, high-single-
digit EPS growth, strong cash ﬂow. And strong returns.
This management team is acutely focused not just on value creation. But on
sustainable value creation over time. And that's the focus that we bring. We're
constantly looking for new opportunities to do so. And as you'll see, I think, from the
subsequent two presentations, we think we have a lot of opportunity to do so in the
coming years.
I do want to brieﬂy introduce, now, our next two speakers. First is Ramon Laguarta.
Ramon has been with PepsiCo for 19 years. He's currently the CEO of Europe Sub-
Saharan Africa. Before that, he was the President of our Developing and Emerging
Markets and he's had a number of operating jobs in our international businesses.
Following him will be Tom Greco. Tom has been with PepsiCo for 29 years. He's the
CEO of Frito-Lay. Before that, he was the Chief Commercial Oﬃcer of PepsiCoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09

Page 4 of 14Ramon LaguartaBeverages. He's also got an enormous amount of operating experience across the
North American continent.
So with that, I will turn it over to Ramon to tell you a little bit about what's happening
in Europe. Ramon?
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you, Hugh. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for your time this
morning. Hopefully, by the end of the session you'll have a good idea of what our
European sector is and why we are very well-positioned to continue growing in the
next coming years.
We're a very scale business in Eastern Europe. In Europe, we're a $40 million, $30
million business and we've been delivering peer-leading performance over the last
two years, about 4% to 5%. Behind this success is two things. One is the balance of
portfolio. We have snacks beverages. And, as you will see, our geographical
diversiﬁcation.
If you look at our balanced portfolio, we are very similar to PepsiCo, a little bit more
of nutrition in the European business. We have a very large snack business,
accounting for about half of our business. We have very strong market positions
wherever we compete, strong right to succeed behind strong brands. It's the
Walkers, Lay's. And Doritos being very strong brands in Europe. And also strong
capabilities we borrow from our global agro-farming. And manufacturing, go-to-
market. And innovation capabilities.
On beverages, we have a leadership position in some NCB segments like tea with
the Lipton brand. And we have a very scale number-two CSD business with very
strong non-sugar position in many European markets. As for nutrition, we have a very
strong nutrition business behind the Tropicana brand in most of Western Europe.
We're leaders in juices in Russia and CIS. We have very strong dairy business in the
East and we are also very strong healthy cereal business behind Quaker in Western
Europe.
In terms of geographical breakdown, we are skewed towards developing markets.
We have very strong business in Eastern Europe, CIS. And Sub-Sahara. We also are
very strong business in Western Europe, which accounts for 40% of our business.
The UK is the strongest market in our Western Europe business. But we have very
strong positions, as well, in Spain, France, Netherlands, Belgium.
Our business in the West skews to snacks. This is largely a snacks business although
we have a very scaled CSD position as well and, as I said, some strong NCB
positions.
Given the nature of our customers, we have asset-light go-to-market systems. We
don't have so much DSD as we have in other parts of the world. We cannot inﬂuenceFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 5 of 14our point of sale the same way we do in other countries. And that, together with a
very strong franchise bottle model gives us a higher margin, a higher margin than
average PepsiCo in the West.
In the East, we have very strong and growing business. The per-caps opportunity in
our Eastern markets is very high. As you will see, the per-caps are very low still. The
category of options are very low in our businesses and we believe we can drive
continued sustainable growth in the future in those markets. We believe in those
markets that still there's a lot of value creation by controlling the point of sale and,
therefore, we invest more in company-owned DSD systems, both in our snacks and
our beverages business. And that gives a lower margin than average PepsiCo.
If you dig down in the UK business -- I'll do a bit of deep down in the UK and the
Russia business. The UK is clearly our stronghold in Western Europe and we have a
very large-scale business in the UK, very proﬁtable, growing nicely, based on a very
strong-scale snack business under the Walkers brand the Doritos brand, where we
have above 40% market share and continue to grow. We have a very strong Quaker
business, growing with the megatrends around healthy cereals. And we have a very
strong juice business, with Tropicana and Naked also growing very nicely. We have a
very strong partnership with Britvic that allows us to have a lot of scale in LRB and
gain share in the CSD business we've done in the last few years.
As you know, the market is quite challenged now in the UK given the increased
competition between retailers in the last two years to ﬁght against discounters and
e-commerce. However, in spite of that, we've been able grow our businesses behind
what we think are three key pillars.
One, continue to invest in our brands, our core brands; our Walkers, Tropicana,
Naked, Quaker. And Pepsi brands and scaling up the quality of the events. For
example, Champions League, we scaled the sponsorship of the Champions League
for the next three years. We're building up a lot of scaled events with Lay's and Pepsi
in all our Western European markets in the coming months.
Continue to innovate behind very clear consumer trends. And I put here some
examples; Healthy Breakfast with Hots, Better for You Snacking with crackers under
Sunbites. And Drink to Eat with our Naked brand.
And obviously, we keep investing. And the UK is the raw model for us for the balance
of the sector, in commercial capabilities that allow us to navigate very well through
the challenged retail environment with revenue management, category
management, insights, digital, etc.
If we turn to these, clearly Russia is our largest business. We are the number-one
food and beverage company in Russia with a very balanced portfolio; probably the
most balanced of all PepsiCo in terms of snacks, beverages. And nutrition. And with
a very integrated operating model. Clearly, our categories; we run the business as anFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 14integrated operating model from the back oﬃce all the way to the customer in the
majority of the components of the value chain.
We believe there is huge growth potential still in Russia and CIS in the coming years.
If you look at the category adoption for most of the business we compete in, it's
about one-fourth to one-ﬁfth of Western Europe; so, very low. Obviously, some
markets even lower than that. And we believe that there are clear megatrends in the
way of urbanization, development of middle class, obviously, the movement from
unpackaged to packaged that will drive and is driving the growth of our categories
and will continue to drive in the future.
At the same time, we leverage Russia as a gateway to the CIS. And for example, if
you look at our share of market performance in the CIS markets in savory over the
last ﬁve years, we're now leaders everywhere, leveraging our factories in Russia,
leveraging the brand activities in Russia, leveraging the talent in Russia. This is
countries like Kazakhstan, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan.
Clearly there are short-term challenges in the Russia business and you've seen it,
probably, in most of the presentations. There is nothing new. This country has been
through crisis in the last 10 years. We have very strong and very experienced local
management in each one of the markets, in Ukraine, in Russia, the CIS markets, that
have been through these turbulences. And we're managing the business to stay
competitive, to make sure that our brands remain relevant with our consumers, that
we continue to provide value to the consumers. We stay as core considerers of value
to our customers and we adapt our cost and our business model to their realities to
continue long-term proﬁtability with a very clear long-term view on the future, on the
long term. We believe that these markets have a lot of long-term potential and the
way we navigate the crisis has to always take into consideration the long-term
potential.
I'll give you a few examples on what are the key things we're doing to keep driving
our performance in Russia in the next few years. One is continue building leading
brands. And within those brands, you'll see we have a lot of global brands; Lay's,
Pepsi, Lipton, Ad-Rush. We have a lot of local brands that give us the right to
compete in some segments where our global brands cannot, like Agusha to the J7.
We continue to drive productivity very heavily to maintain or expand our margins
and continue to be the number-one partner to our customers, as you will see.
If you deep dive into brand building. And I've put an example here of Lay's, we have
a very strong capability in Russia and Eastern Europe to build new brands. For
example, Lay's we started 10 years ago, now is the number-one snack in Eastern
Europe. We started with Lipton, also, 10 years ago and now Lipton is the number-one
tea in Eastern Europe. We have Adrenaline Rush we created from zero now is
leading energy brand in Russia. So we have a great track record of building brands
in the East.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 7 of 14This summer we focused on Lay's. And Lay's we wanted to go deep dive in this
demand, Fun Times Together demand moment, where we think there is a huge
potential for penetrating even more in Russia. And we took the summer where,
obviously, there is a lot of events happening with good weather that drive to that
demand moment of Fun Times Together.
We took the best of PepsiCo. We took global brand imagery. We took ﬂavors from
around the world. And we list and adapt to Russia to create a limited edition for the
summer. We took global advertising. And we activated very, very strongly around
this concept of Summer Tastes Better with Lay's. The local teams did a great job
activating with digital 360 and in every single point where consumers had a chance
to consume the product, the lakes, be it the coast, be it the environment in the
riverside in the interior.
Clearly we painted Russia yellow and you can see the results there in terms of market
share. We already have obviously a very strong market share in potato chips in Russia
with 61%. We grew 4 points of share over the last year with these sort of investments.
And the good thing is that we keep rolling out these activities across Eastern Europe
with the same assets.
In terms of productivity, clearly a very strong enabler of our position in Russia. And
this we're dialing up, obviously as the crisis develops, we have done productivity
across multiple things.
In our assets, we have minimized our ﬁxed assets over time. We have been reducing
the number of factories. We keep reducing the number of factories this year. We
reduced one juice factory and two dairy factories. We continue to reduce our
working capital. We're reducing our cash conversion cycle by 72% over the last four
years by reducing SKUs, optimizing our demand-supply forecasting. And we keep
driving business model optimization across all the go-to-market, supply chain. And
back oﬃce.
In terms of our customers, this is a key pillar of our strategy, we want to be the
number-one execution company in Russia. We have been nominated the number-
one food and beverage supplier for our customers. We want to continue being a big
source of value to our customers. And here we're working on two things; capabilities
and go-to-market.
On the go-to-market, we have a lot of ﬂexibility in the way we can build go-to-market
solutions by category, by geography. And by value chain component. And we have
this mosaic in a way that maximizes growth potential and minimizes costs. And for
example, this is a guideline, obviously cities, mega-cities like Moscow, we have more
company-owned go-to-market systems. In other rural areas we have more third-
party. But we're able to really modulate the way we go to market with this level of
ﬂexibility.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 8 of 14Tom GrecoWe are driving more and more cross-category events and we are growing the
number of common display snacks and beverages across all colors of trade and that
is creating huge value for our customers and for our consumers. And we're investing
in a lot of capabilities to continue driving this partnership with our customers in joint
business planning, innovation. And growth programs and technology.
So to wrap it up and to give you a sense of why we can continue to be a best-
performing company in Europe, along with the priorities that Hugh stated, we're
going to continue to invest in brand building. We're making very deliberate choices
about which categories we want to invest and how we're going to scale up our
investments. And we're going to be leveraging more and more A&M across multiple
markets.
Innovation, we want to continue focusing on innovation around mega-trends. So
some examples around Hots, Naked. And Sunbites and also value-added dairy in the
East. We're going continue investing in customer-centric capabilities to be the best-
preferred partner by our customers. And obviously, we're going to scale up
productivity. We're going to dial up in productivity both in assets and in OpEx's to
drive cost returns, improve our margins. And continue delivering this peer-leading
performance in top line.
And now please, Tom, to wrap it up with the U.S.
{BIO 15063682 <GO>}
Well. Good morning, everyone. And thanks, Ramon. It's great to be back here at
Barclays to talk to you about Frito-Lay.
And ﬁrst of all, we continue to deliver very strong results. Our net revenue CAGR
over the past ﬁve years is 3.1%, making it the growth leader within the North
American CPG landscape. Additionally, we're maniacally focused on productivity,
which has led to a 5.7% CAGR over the last ﬁve years and 3.3 points of operating
margin expansion.
The great news is we still have plenty of room to grow. In total, Americans spend $1.4
trillion on food and beverages. Approximately half of this, or $687 billion, is
purchased in retail channels and is largely at-home consumption. Macro-snacks
comprise 13.3% of food and beverage at retail. The other half of food and beverage
expenditures is spent in food service, or $702 billion. This is largely consumed away
from home. Food service has proven to be a terriﬁc place for us to extend our
brands.
Shifting to the top right, we can see that macro-snacks is a very big part of food and
beverage with total sales of $125 billion. Americans love to snack with 46 occasions
per month. And at Frito-Lay we have 16.6% of these occasions or approximately eight
occasions per month. We've been gaining macro-snack share for three straight years
and we intend to build on this momentum. You've seen this chart earlier this
morning so I'll skip right through to the next slide.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 9 of 14Let's talk about brand building at Frito-Lay and talk about Doritos Roulette where
one in ﬁve chips are extremely hot. Roulette has been a runaway success all over the
world. And in the U.S., we launched Roulette in June. It was the largest limited-time
oﬀer in the history of the brand. The program was activated through social media
exclusively through digital channels. We had a daily Twitter contest to see who got
burned.
Additionally, on Twitter's live streaming app, Periscope, we hosted a game show
where consumers could play Doritos Roulette and win prizes. We had over 1,000
hours of live video streaming and generated more than 48 million impressions.
Believe it or not, Roulette was the number-three national trending topic that day.
Unfortunately, Ben Aﬄeck and Jennifer Garner broke up on the same day and that
displaced us from the ﬁrst spot. This is just one of many examples of how we build
muscular brands in today's digital world.
Building our brands through A&M investment is a key plank in our playbook. It
builds equity, elevates the consumer experience. And enables pricing power.
To ensure sustained growth on Lay's, we took a hard look at how marketplace
dynamics were impacting our potato chip business back in 2013. There were three
speciﬁc ﬁndings as we considered reﬁnements to our Lay's lineup.
First, on the consumer side, households were getting smaller. By the end of 2014,
over 60% of U.S. households had two people or less, making a strong case for a
smaller bag of take-home Lay's. Meanwhile, our customers were facing huge margin
pressures. In 2014, grocery margins had dipped over 40 basis points in just one year.
And ﬁnally, we knew that over 90% of Lay's take-home business was in just one size.
In fact, we had 14 SKUs of 10-ounce Lay's and the majority of the transactions on this
size were buy-one-get-one-free.
There had to be a better solution. Supported with sustained media investment, we
tested a new price-size architecture for Lay's for one full year with the following
objectives; drive household penetration, accelerate market share, improve customer
margins. And enable pricing runway.
As a result, we recently introduced a smaller 8-ounce bag of Lay's with full variety.
We then reduced the lineup on our 10-ounce bag and branded this Family Size.
Finally, we added weight to our largest size and branded this Party Size.
During the second and Third Quarter of this year, we executed this massive change
across all channels on Lay's. We've now completed over 25,000 section resets and,
in many cases, our customers rewarded us with incremental shelf space to go after
the sales, margin. And proﬁt opportunity.
While we're frequently reminded that we can never underestimate how long it takes
to fundamentally change consumer behavior, by shifting our promotional emphasis
from 14 SKUs at buy-one-get-one-free on key holidays to just four to ﬁve SKUs, we'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 10 of 14pleased with early returns. Customer margins are up, unit share and growth is
accelerating. And we're getting excellent price mix and P&L ﬂow-through; all green
on our scorecard.
Two opportunities remain; household penetration and volume growth. And as a
result, we've made surgical reﬁnements to our plan in the Fourth Quarter. Our PC
prize-size reinvention was a big change to a big thing and an important step in
evolving our price-size lineup to be more relevant for today's consumer and
customer landscape.
In addition to brand building, innovation continues to be a major growth driver for
Frito-Lay. In terms of at-home innovation, we launched Cheetos Sweetos in March,
our ﬁrst sweet and salty product on Cheetos. It was an overwhelming success as
Cheetos was up 10% for the four weeks leading up to Easter.
In work, school, breaks, there's a huge opportunity with on-the-go portion control.
Rold Gold Pretzel Crackers meet this need and are driving 10% growth in our ready-
to-go portfolio in the cookie-cracker aisle.
Additionally, there is growth in premium better-for-you snacking. In this demand
space, we've had a very strong year behind new products like Tostitos Organic
Scoops, which is driving 12% growth on our Simply portfolio, along with Smartfood
Delights, where sales have literally doubled versus year ago with much more to
come in Q4 and in 2016.
In away-from-home, we've reformulated our lineup for schools and have accelerated
our education segment growth double digits year to date.
Finally, we continue to build momentum on culinary innovation with our food service
partners. As an example, we're testing Fritos Tacos with Taco Bell in Memphis. Here's
a commercial from the Memphis test market of Fritos Tacos. So you can see we're
trying to solve consumer needs all the time.
Of course, we have to be relentless in improving our service and execution model by
providing our outstanding DSD sales organization with best-in-class tools, training.
And technology. A great example of this is our Doritos Avengers program from
earlier this year. In this respect, our digital playbook and selling tools are best-in-
class. Avengers was the largest promotion ever executed on Doritos. In one large
customer, we executed a promotional endcap all across every store in one week,
driving scans 52% during the ﬁve weeks of the event.
Finally, we're laser-focused on driving productivity. Within supply chain, we continue
to expand GES. This gives us signiﬁcant productivity as a result of fewer facilities and
lower inventory. The great thing about GES is that it is also a growth enabler as it
expands SKU availability for our DSD team to sell. This is central to our longer-term
plan to build unmatched capabilities in executing at a granular store level. This
enables us to put premium brands like Smartfood Air Delights in premium storesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 11 of 14A - William Marshall
A - Tom Grecoand value products like Chester's Fries in value stores. By the end of 2016, we'll have
nine sites up in deployment and by 2020 a signiﬁcant amount of our volume will go
through GES locations.
Additionally, we continue to leverage automation throughout the manufacturing
process. This includes packaging, palletizing. And case picking. Productivity has
been, is. And always will be a key element in our growth agenda.
So allow me to wrap up. Frito-Lay continues to perform at a very high level. We led
all food manufacturers in the U.S. and Canada in absolute growth in 2013, in 2014.
And, once again, year to date in 2015 we are leading growth, as you can see from the
chart on the left. We've also expanded margins in each of those years.
In total, PepsiCo North America is having an excellent year. In fact, we've already
crossed the $1 billion mark in syndicated data absolute scan growth in measured
channels. And in total, we're more than double the growth of our nearest food and
beverage competitor. This is important for our customers and food service partners
who really count on us to drive growth in a challenging environment.
At this point, Hugh, Ramon. And I would be happy to take your questions.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 16594232 <GO>}
Thank you, and thank you for the presentation. Tom, I was just wondering, if I start
with Frito-Lay, you talked about the revenue management program you started this
year. I was wondering if you could put that in context of the 3.1% revenue growth,
5.7% proﬁt growth that we've seen historically, speciﬁcally breaking that down
between how we should expect Frito-Lay to see price mix and volume ﬂow-through,
both in the short term, as you put this program in place. And then, over the long
term, more of the ongoing algorithm.
{BIO 15063682 <GO>}
Sure. Well I mean the potato chip initiative I just referenced was a big factor in our
economics, certainly, in the Second Quarter. And it was something that we really felt
we had to do. We tested it thoroughly and we expected a transition period.
The second thing I'll tell you is we're very excited about some of the metrics that
we're seeing out of that. We've learned a lot. For instance, I referenced the customer
margins being up, the unit growth accelerating. And as we transition from, as I said,
14 SKUs at buy-one-get-one-free to a narrower lineup, some of that volume has gone
to other brands, which generally are more proﬁt than buy-one-get-one-free potato
chips. And in some cases, it's gone to potato chip ﬂavors themselves where we were
actually leaving some money on the table, if you will, on these key holidays with
proprietary ﬂavors like Limon Lay's that we were discounting heavily.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09

A - Hugh JohnstonSo a lot of very positive things have come of it and it gave us pricing runway going
forward on Lay's, which we'd actually kind of run out of. You can only trade up and
raise prices so many times before you've got to sort of reset that agenda within
potato chips themselves. So we feel very good about all of those things.
Now, on the volume growth front and going forward price mix, we continue to invest
heavily in R&D, invest heavily in A&M. And our execution capabilities to get the
volume growth back up to historic levels that you're accustomed to. So no major
changes. But this was essentially a one-time reset of our potato chip business that we
had to do.

The only thing I'd add to that, Bill, is I wouldn't think of it as a revenue management
initiative. I would think of it as a strategic initiative to increase household penetration
and increase customer proﬁtability. It has revenue management elements to it,
which, obviously, we're pleased with. But that was not the intent. The intent was to,
basically, increase the strength of the brands and increase the strength of the
product penetration.

One more. Hugh, we've heard a lot so far as the conference has progressed about
M&A, particularly in food. But across consumer packaged goods. I'm curious if we
can get an update, your updated thoughts on PepsiCo's strategy around M&A. That
could be acquisitions or divestitures. And if there's been any urgency or change in
the thinking with the cost of ﬁnancing and the interest rate environment and how we
should think about that going forward.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Really no change at all. I mean we've been pretty clear on that over the last couple of
years. I'm not sure I have a lot new to say. We've always taken the point of view we
don't think we need large-scale M&A. We think we've got the portfolio right, as I just
presented. At the same time, we're, as a management team, as I also mentioned,
acutely value-creation focused. Now, M&A prices are extremely high right now. That
certainly makes for a diﬃcult environment even with low-cost ﬁnancing. So no
update, no change there at all.

Thank you. Then PepsiCo has done an impressive job on the productivity front;
completing the $3 billion program, another $5 billion program. A lot of the emphasis
today was kind of around R&D, innovation. How should we think about the ability
and willingness to spend this back into the business versus ﬂowing down to the
bottom line? And if you could kind of unpack how you think about how this
productivity will ﬂow through going forward.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Hugh JohnstonYes, I'm happy to do that. Then, Tom and Ramon, please jump in in terms of speciﬁcs
in your areas of the world.
Flowing it through the bottom line is always a question that we wrestle with; should
we deliver more now or should we strengthen the business for sustainability going
forward? The approach we've taken is we've said we want to be balanced in doing
that. And obviously, from what you've seen, mid-single-digit revenue to high-single-
digit EPS, means we are ﬂowing some of that productivity to the bottom line.
Margins are a complicated topic, right? It goes way beyond productivity. It goes to
business unit mix. It goes to geographic mix. It goes to not just commodity inﬂation.
But operating expense inﬂation. All of those factors weigh in. So it's diﬃcult to one-
oﬀ a productivity number into a bottom line outcome other than the overall
guidance that we've given and, in the last couple of years, we've beaten pretty
consistently.
My expectation is we'll continue to do as we have been doing. We'll ﬂow some of it
to the bottom line. We'll continue to invest some of it in growth that has been mega-
cap CPG industry-leading over the last couple years because we think over a seven;
to eight-year timeframe that's going to create the most sustainable value for our
investors. And that's the orientation we have is; how do we ensure we create
sustainable value over seven; and eight-year timeframes not quick-hit productivity
programs.
{BIO 16594232 <GO>}
Thank you.
Thanks. Hugh, you referenced the commodities a little bit. Can you update us a little
bit on sort of your outlook going forward with commodities? It would seem they
would be pretty favorable for you for the next 12, 18 months if we look at current spot
rates.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Yes. We don't really provide guidance going into next year until we get closer to that
point. And I'm not trying to be obstinate with that at all. The point is the world is such
a volatile place, in all candor I'd worry if I gave it to you this far out. I'd probably, by
the time we got to our normal guidance, I might not be right. Recall this time last
year where the currencies were relative to where they sit right now. Commodities, to
some degree, fall in the same camp.
Obviously, generally speaking, the commodities outlook is pretty favorable. So from
that perspective, other than being priced in dollars, which creates international
commodity inﬂation for us, the commodities outlook is pretty good. But getting into
speciﬁc numbers at this point is probably premature from a process perspective.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09

thanking Hugh, Tom, Ramon. And Jamie. Also thank you very much for the snacks
and beverages you provided throughout the conference. Thank you.
