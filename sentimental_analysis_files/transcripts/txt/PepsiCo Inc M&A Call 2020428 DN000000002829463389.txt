Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the pre-recorded discussion of PepsiCo's
First Quarter Earnings Results. My name is Ravi Pamnani, and I'm the Senior Vice
President of Investor Relations at PepsiCo. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman
and CEO, Ramon Laguarta, and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston.
Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We will make
forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans and
2020 guidance and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.
Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only
reﬂect our view as of today, April 28th, and we are under no obligation to update.
When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain
items from reported results. Please refer to today's earnings release and 10-Q
available on pepsico.com for deﬁnitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures
and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors
that could cause actual results to materially diﬀer from forward-looking statements.
As a reminder, our ﬁnancial results in the United States and Canada are reported on
a 12-week basis, while substantially all of our international operations report on a
monthly calendar basis, for which, the months of January and February are reﬂected
in our results for the 12 weeks ended March 21st, 2020.
And now it's my pleasure to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Thank you, Ravi, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to open my comments this
morning with a message to our employees, customers, and communities. During this
very diﬃcult time around the globe, PepsiCo's employees quickly adapted and
overcame challenges to fulﬁll our important role in the food supply chain of many
countries. Facing very diﬃcult conditions, we worked hard to ensure that our food
and beverage products were on the shelves when shoppers needed them most.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-28
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 2 of 8This is particularly true of our front-line employees who are the backbone of our
company. We've taken steps designed to ensure they'll be protected and treated
well as they do their jobs in this diﬃcult environment. To all our people, I'd say a
heartfelt thank you.
To our customers, we've always sought to provide the best possible service. In the
face of these many challenges, we will continue to support your business by
ensuring your customers have access to our broad selection of great convenient
food and beverage products. We look to all your business every day and we want to
be your best supplier in both good times and especially in diﬃcult times.
And to our communities where we work and live, we want you to know that we
recognize our role as both an employer and a neighbor. We've partnered with local
oﬃcials to help keep our communities safe and we've committed to contribute more
than $50 million to provide meals for needy families and children as well as
assistance to local healthcare providers as they do their vital work. We're proud to be
a global company with very local ties and will continue to be there for our
communities. Providing support to our employees, customers, and communities
comes at a cost to the company, and I believe it's a commitment that reﬂects who we
are, our purpose, our values, and our investment in our future together.
Despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, our business delivered 7.9% organic
revenue growth and 10% core constant currency earnings per share growth in the
ﬁrst quarter. The quarter began with a strong global macro environment backdrop in
January and February, followed by the high level of uncertainty and volatility in
March. As we exited the quarter, we saw a notable increase in overall customer and
consumer demand along with a shift in channel preferences due to mandated
shelter-in-place and social distancing measures.
The impact of these changes during the ﬁrst quarter primarily occurred in the US
and Canada as the ﬁrst quarter for most of our international businesses ended in
February. Based on our internal analysis of how organic revenue growth was faring
before and after these changes, we estimate that organic revenue increased in
excess of 5% even when excluding these changes. This represents an acceleration
versus the second half of 2019 and reﬂects the underlying strength of our categories,
our focus on market share, and the investment we've made in becoming Faster,
Stronger and Better. This is also testament to having a strong portfolio of large
trusted brands in growing categories with expandable consumption traits.
Our organic revenue growth was broad-based with a high single-digit increase in
organic revenue across developed as well as developing and emerging markets and
within both global snacks and global beverages. In our largest developed market,
the US, all three of our divisions delivered very strong organic revenue growth with a
notable acceleration as the quarter progressed. Frito-Lay North America delivered
strong net revenue growth across its large mainstream and premium brands. Our
Quaker Foods business also performed well with net revenue growth driven by both
improved category growth and market share gains across many categories.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-28
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 8At PepsiCo Beverages North America, our carbonated soft drink business performed
well with trademark Pepsi increasing its net revenue for the seventh consecutive
quarter while trademark Mountain Dew returned to growth. And our non-carbonated
portfolio delivered strong double-digit growth with broad-based strength across
nearly all brands. However, our proﬁtability at PBNA was negatively impacted by
both product and channel mix shifts in the quarter and a signiﬁcant reserve recorded
for uncollectible receivables as a result of COVID-19.
Overall, our North American businesses were performing well even before the spike
in demand that occurred late in the quarter, as we beneﬁted from a very successful
Super Bowl, which featured many of our big brands combined with strong in-store
execution of the event, higher levels of advertising and marketing support. The
continued success of our innovation activity, which includes Gatorade Zero bubly,
Mountain Dew Zero, Lay's Poppables, Cheetos Popcorn and many others, increased
manufacturing capacity in growth packages and selling capacity across both food
and beverages, an accelerated local focus from our divisional and regional
structures, and strong revenue management and productivity gains across our
businesses.
Now, moving to the international markets, our businesses delivered strong organic
revenue growth as developing and emerging markets led the way with a double-
digit increase in organic revenue in Mexico, India, Egypt, Turkey, Pakistan, Saudi
Arabia, and South Africa, high single digit growth in Colombia, and mid-single digit
increase in Brazil, Russia, and Poland. In most markets, the growth was broad-based
across both snacks and beverages, beneﬁting from our investments in higher
advertising and increased manufacturing and selling capacity.
Our recently acquired SodaStream business also continued to deliver strong net
revenue growth in excess of 20% as both penetration and frequency increased with
more consumers enjoying and experimenting with its environmentally friendly at-
home platform. We believe we have a long runway for growth in many international
markets and our ﬁrst quarter results were a huge reminder on the importance of
investing in these markets for the long term.
To recap, our ﬁrst quarter results show strong and accelerating momentum across
our businesses both with and without the revenue targets [ph] associated, big
changes in consumer behavior mentioned earlier. This gives us conﬁdence that the
investment behind our Faster, Stronger, and Better framework are working as we
invest in our brands, supply chain, and go-to-market systems, manufacturing
capacity, capabilities and culture, and our society by integrating purpose into
everything we do.
As we move forward, we see many opportunities along with some risks associated
with the dynamic changes in society and consumer behavior as a result of COVID-19,
and we expect these changes to vary in scope and timing across diﬀerent markets or
retail channels throughout the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-28
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 4 of 8In developed markets, we see consumers moving through several emotional and
behavioral changes as they adjust their lives to the new realities they face. We
believe there are four stages to this evolution. The ﬁrst is preparation and
prevention. The second is conﬁnement and cocooning. The third is a restricted
recovery and the fourth is a new normal.
These stages have important implications for our business both from a marketing
and channel perspective. Certainly, in most developed markets, this moves beyond
the preparation and prevention phase and appear to be in the later stages of
conﬁnement, in which shelter-in-place and social distancing have become a new way
of life. Consumers have shifted their consumption habits to more at-home locations,
increased their usage of traditional large format and e-commerce channels, and
increased their basket size. Conversely, they've also shifted away from immediate
consumption channels, that is convenient and gas and foodservice, which
disproportionately impacts the revenue and proﬁtability of our US beverage
business.
With consumers spending more time at home, we've seen an increase in eating
breakfast and a tendency to snack more during the day. The Frito and Quaker food
businesses are well positioned to capitalize on these changes, and as a result, we've
seen higher household penetration across a variety of our products. Given these
countervailing impacts within channels and categories, our portfolio does have
somewhat of a natural hedge, although the negative impact on beverages is more
signiﬁcant than the positive impact on snacks.
In response to these shifts, we've adjusted our advertising, revenue management,
and go-to-market priorities across our businesses and channels. We prioritized SKUs
to maximize manufacturing capacity and supply chain eﬃciencies and we're
adjusting our promotions to capitalize on fewer shopping trips with larger basket
size.
The key uncertainty that we're facing is around timing and when consumers may shift
back to restricted recovery and a new normal. With some exceptions, we largely
expect consumers to eventually return to previous habits as they slowly exit
conﬁnement and cautiously settle into new normal. In the interim, we expect a
continuation of increased purchasing patterns in large format and e-commerce
channels and softness in immediate consumption channels. As behaviors evolve, we
expect to see a gradual improvement in the convenience and gas channels as
people return to work while the restaurants and venues that involve large gatherings
such as movie theaters or sporting events take longer to adjust.
One factor that we believe will help us in managing the balance of this impact is our
acquisition of Rockstar and our agreement to distribute Bang energy drinks in the
US. These strategic actions will unlock the ability to increase our participation in the
higher growth and higher margin energy drink categories where we have not been
able to capture our fair share to date.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-28
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 5 of 8Moving forward, our energy strategy will consist of three elements. We'll look to
accelerate the performance of Rockstar, which has further room for growth. We will
expand the distribution of Bang and improve execution in the marketplace, and we
will unlock the potential for Mountain Dew to expand in the energy category. Dew
was in many the original energy drink and there are lots of confection and
(inaudible) to innovate with Dew in ways that were previously unavailable to us. I
look forward to sharing more with you on this in the future.
Now moving to developing and emerging markets, there are diﬀerent measures and
restrictions in place associated with conﬁnement and social distancing, and the
timing and duration of these measures have varied by country. From a category and
channel perspective, we're seeing similar trends to developed markets in which our
snacks and food businesses are more resilient and less discretionary than beverages,
where there is more exposure to immediate consumption channels that are being
signiﬁcantly impacted by the current environment. However, unlike developed
markets, there is a relatively lower amount of disposable income generated by most
consumers. While our categories have room for development and a long runway for
growth, we do expect a deceleration in organic revenue across our developing and
emerging markets as macroeconomic forces strain consumer purchasing in the
coming months.
In addition, the strengthening US dollar presents a formidable challenge in several
key developing markets. Mexico and Russia are notable examples where an
economically pressured consumer will make revenue management actions diﬃcult,
while transactional foreign exchange headwinds will simultaneously create pressure
on the cost structure of those businesses.
While we have expectations and strong plans, there are many unknowns and
uncertainties; how people will actually behave, what will the pace of economic and
our category recoveries be, and how will COVID itself behave going forward.
Therefore, we believe the company's previous ﬁnancial outlook for 2020 is no longer
applicable and will not be updated at this time.
However, as we manage through this new environment, we're leveraging our
strengths and have established a clear set of guidelines and actions for our business
leaders. I'd like to highlight a few examples. The ﬁrst is reinforcing our culture with a
set of overarching principles in a manner that is consistent with the PepsiCo Way,
which emphasizes that associates act like owners with integrity and get things done
quickly. We believe acting on these principles can enhance our standing with
customers, consumers, and employees.
The second is about being nimble with a big focus on accelerating revenue growth
and improving value market share. In order to do so, we formed a committee to
meet the recent re-planning of each business and this committee will meet biweekly
for the rest of the year to monitor performance and continually make resource
allocation adjustments as circumstances warrant.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-28
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 8And the third is driving productivity to fund the investments in our business. We'll
continue to invest in key initiatives that will transform the operating capabilities of
the company and make us stronger for the future and make commercial investments
in high-return activities that, we believe, will enable us to emerge from the crisis in a
competitively advantaged position. At the same time, we will aggressively challenge
our cost structure holistically with a zero base mindset and revaluate all other
investments for the year.
These principles and processes are giving us the ability to quickly make decisions in
a strategic manner that balances between the needs to execute now and to
eﬀectively position us to emerge from the crisis as an even stronger company that
will create value for an even greater duration.
Importantly, as the crisis evolves, there will also be opportunities to engage
consumers with our brands and use the breadth and depth of our go-to-market
systems to improve our position in the marketplace to win with customers. And we
will embrace these opportunities to develop an even more agile and resilient supply
chain with more accurate and rapid forecasting and response capability, support the
continued growth of e-commerce where the retail sales increased approximately
45% in the ﬁrst quarter, and tailor our plans for economically sensitive channels such
as foodservice, and convenient and gas with an objective to improve our presence
and build deeper relationships with our customers, identify and plan for lasting new
habits and consumption patterns, and tailor our innovation and brand
communication plans accordingly to achieve greater consumer awareness and
engagement with our brands, implement proactive long-term revenue management
capabilities in developing and emerging markets to mitigate the impact of frequent
foreign exchange evaluations, and ﬁnally, identify these locations for high return-on-
investment opportunities that can improve our market position or provide access to
advantaged capabilities that can create value over time.
In summary, we believe that PepsiCo is well positioned to adapt and succeed over
the long term. We will continue to collaborate and leverage learnings across our
entire organization and build on our strengths, some of which include well-known
brands that consumers love, and most importantly, that consumers trust. Strong
positions in growing categories with expandable consumption traits, most notably in
snacks and foods, an agile supply chain with strong local sourcing networks and
ﬂexible and advantaged direct store delivery go-to-market system, and a highly
experienced set of global business leaders who have the empowerment,
knowledge, and agility to make rapid, decentralized decisions to meet the needs of
their local business.
We're focused on executing to succeed in the new environment, but also remain
cognizant that we should not make short-term decisions that may impact or disrupt
our business or our brands over the long term. We intend to protect investments that
are central to our Faster, Stronger, Better strategy such as enhancing our systems
and commercial capabilities. We believe that our focus on revenue growth and value
market share will serve our company and stakeholders well over the long term.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-28

Page 7 of 8Hugh F. JohnstonTo conclude, I want to again acknowledge the hard work of our employees within
such a challenging time. They've worked tirelessly to satisfy our customers and
consumers during this time of need and I am extremely proud of their dedication
and eﬀorts.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Hugh.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Thank you, Ramon, and good morning, everyone. As Ramon mentioned earlier, our
previous ﬁnancial outlook for 2020 is no longer applicable and will not be updated
at this time due to the uncertainty and volatility associated with the current
environment as a result of COVID-19. While the ﬁrst quarter exceeded our
expectations and some of our businesses have continued to perform well to date,
we've also seen signiﬁcant softness in immediate consumption channels and
disruptions due to retail closures and other restrictions put in place as a result of
COVID-19.
In addition, our business has experienced higher labor, logistics, and service costs to
meet customer needs. We expect these costs to persist and remain committed to
making the necessary long-term investments to support our employees and
customers, while also investing in capabilities that drive competitive advantage for
our business.
To mitigate some of these challenges, we are controlling what we can. This includes
tightly managing our discretionary expenses, reducing non-essential advertising and
marketing spend to reﬂect the realities of the current environment, and optimizing
our revenue management capabilities wherever possible. We have also reduced the
complexity of our product oﬀerings by prioritizing high-velocity SKUs to maximize
production capacity.
While we hope these challenges are temporary in nature, we cannot reasonably
predict when the environment will improve or exactly how consumer habits will
evolve. However, for the full-year 2020, we continue to expect our annual core
eﬀective tax rate to be approximately 21%, total cash returns to shareholders of
approximately $7.5 billion, comprised of dividends of $5.5 billion and share
repurchases of $2 billion, and we now expect foreign exchange translation to
negatively impact our reported revenue and core EPS by 3 to 4 percentage points
based on current market consensus rates. The expected cash returns reﬂect a
previously announced 7% increase in the annualized dividend per share eﬀective
with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2020. This will represent the
company's 48th consecutive annual dividend per share increase.
With respect to our liquidity and balance sheet, we believe we have ample ﬂexibility
to meet the investment needs of our business and return cash to shareholders. Our
business generates a signiﬁcant amount of cash ﬂow. The long-term debt and Tier 1
commercial paper markets remain open to us at favorable rates and extended
maturities and we have not drawn on our $7.5 billion committed bank facilities.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-04-28
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 8 of 8Ramon L. LaguartaNow, with respect to the second quarter, I'd like to note the following. We expect our
organic revenue growth to decline at a low single digit rate and we expect our
operating margin to be negatively impacted by the weakness in immediate
consumption channels and retail closures and restrictions associated with COVID-19.
We expect foreign exchange translation headwind to negatively impact our net
revenue and core earnings per share performance by a low to mid-single digit
percentage rate and the acquisitions of Pioneer Foods and Rockstar and our
distribution agreement with Bang Energy will begin to be reﬂected in our reported
results.
Now I'll turn it back to Ramon for some closing comments.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Thank you, Hugh. Now, thank you all of you for your time this morning. I'm incredibly
proud of the way our organization has responded to this crisis and executed to date.
Look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year and we thank
you all for the conﬁdence you've placed in us with your investment.
