Q - Jeﬀrey Andrew Bernsteinto provide an opportunity to further discuss our strategic priorities and operational
initiatives as well as our updated guidance. These details are outlined in our press
release. And the corresponding slide deck has been posted on our website at
investor.starbucks.com.
To maximize our time, we will forgo any formal opening remarks and dive into Q&A
with our President and CEO, Kevin Johnson; Group President, Americas and Chief
Operating Oﬃcer, Roz Brewer; and CFO, Scott Maw.
Before turning the call over to the operator, I'd like to remind you that this
conference will include forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks
and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to diﬀer materially from these
statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with
cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our ﬁlings
with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no
obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.
Please refer to our website to ﬁnd the reconciliation of non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures
referenced in today's call with the corresponding GAAP measures. This conference
call is being webcast. And a replay of the webcast will be available on our website
within the next few hours and will be available through July 25, 2018.
I will now turn the call over back to the operator to begin the Q&A.
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Jeﬀrey Bernstein
with Barclays Capital.
{BIO 7208345 <GO>}
Maybe a 2-part question just on the comps. The ﬁrst was just similarly looking back
to late April, it seems like you guys are fairly conﬁdent in a 3% comp for ﬁscal 3Q. So
must've been doing okay in April. Then in June, it seems like you're back to
approaching the 3% again. So I'm wondering kind of in your view, what drove the
seemingly sharp May decline, whether or not you'd really attribute all of it to the
Philadelphia incident or maybe this is just a new level of volatility that we should
expect to continue month to month, which kind of just points to my second question
which -- if this is really the new kind of long-term volatility we're going to be seeing
with comps now low single digit in the U.S. and ﬂat to negative in China. I mean,
both of them have been declining for multiple quarters. I'm just wondering whether
the conversation comes up internally to consider lowering that long-term target
further from the 3% to 5%, which seems like a stretch and something that a company
-- now that's not growth at scale. It would seem like it's just a tougher thing to beat or
more often than not, exceed.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19

Q - John Stephenson Glass
A - Kevin R. Johnson{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes. This is Kevin. Let me answer the ﬁrst part of the -- I'll answer both questions. And
then Scott and Roz are here with me. They can chime in. First of all, I think in the mid-
April, as this incident was unfolding in Philadelphia, we paused launching our
Afternoon Made marketing campaign, the TV ad campaign that you see running
right now. We paused it for 2 weeks. We didn't think it was appropriate to launch that
campaign in the middle of dealing with the situation in Philadelphia and all that
came with that. By delaying it, the -- it stalled the momentum then coming into early
May. And I think that was a signiﬁcant driver. Since launching it 2 weeks later and as
it's now kicked in and we got through a lot of the noise in May from the Philadelphia
situation and the racial bias training that we did on May 29, following May 29, we're
now comping U.S. trending back at 3%. Now longer term, the solution to this is
we've got to expand the number of digital relationships. And that is exactly what we
are doing. By expanding the number of digital relationships, it allows us now to have
-- to communicate directly with a wider range of customers in a way that's relevant to
them and will help us continue to not only raise awareness of new beverages or new
oﬀerings that we have but really start to drive a more personal engagement with
them that we know leads to transaction comp as we've seen in the Rewards
program. And that's why we're so focused on growing the number of registered
customers. The fact that we got 5 million new registered customers in the last 90
days. And that number is just going to continue to grow. The opportunity, which we
haven't tapped in yet, is to now use the personalization engine to do -- to start to do
a better job of marketing and communicating with those digitally registered
customers. In doing that, my view is, that allows us to continue to drive toward and
deliver on the long-term guidance that we set a year ago.
Our next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
First, Kevin, can you just maybe talk through what's happening in China? To go from
8% to 0 in a couple of quarters is a fairly dramatic shift in the business. And I
understand the goal is to grow share through unit growth. But that doesn't happen
usually in a vacuum. So maybe you can just walk through were there missed
opportunities in promotions or something else, competitive, whatever else that you
see that may have led to that. I think that was probably more surprising than U.S.
comps. And just on the U.S. comps, what gets back light users? I understand digital
relationships are important. But when you ask them why are they not coming, is it
more than that? Is it price? Is it some other element that you haven't latched on to
that you think you need to focus on to get them back in the stores?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes, let me take the ﬁrst question. And Roz Brewer is here with me. I'll have Roz talk a
little bit about the work she's done and what she's driving speciﬁcally around the
afternoon daypart and creating the kind of experience that we think will attract
customers both in terms of product and experience in the afternoon. But let me startFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19

Q - David E. Tarantinowith China. In China, I think there's 2 key factors. Number one -- I'll say 3 key factors.
Number one, there were some shifts in holiday that's not going to aﬀect the timing
within the quarter. But we did have some of the holiday items that we sell in the
quarter that did not perform as well as they have in the past. That's number one.
Number two, delivery is now becoming the hot thing in China. And prior leading into
this quarter, there were some third-party services that were allowing customers to
order from them. And they go into the Starbucks stores in China and purchase the
item and deliver it to the customer. That experience was not a great experience. And
there was some -- I think it was driven by the government to want to stop having
third parties do that because it was creating annoyances in those -- not just us but
with the others in the stores. And so the fact that we haven't lit up our mobile order
and delivery, I think, is most likely the #1 driver of that. So the delivery went away this
quarter. That was being done by a third party. And that's why Belinda and team are
actively engaged with a large tech company on a delivery partnership. And we
expect to have that at a place where it can be implemented here by the end of the
calendar year. We expect to hear more about that on the July call. I think that is the
biggest driver. Then the third, which you always look to, is as we've accelerated store
growth, we look at the cannibalization eﬀect of those new stores as we're building
out capacity. And I think that was a minor contributor. I think the big one has to do
with delivery. And that's why we have a priority in China to light up delivery from
Starbucks to customers.
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
So let me address the issues around U.S. comp and afternoon daypart. So as Kevin
mentioned earlier, that we've had weak blended sales. And those sales are most
pronounced in the afternoon daypart. We embarked upon a marketing campaign
that should've begun right at the time the Philadelphia incident happened. And we
delayed that by 2 weeks. And because it was -- it's facing our iced beverages and a
certain afternoon daypart and it was the season transition to spring, summer, there's
a very signiﬁcant gap there in that 2-week period of miss. We have seen that come
back as we've run the campaign. We're getting a lot more experience in terms of
matching the campaign with our intention to focus directly on product. We saw it
worked very well with blended -- I'm sorry, with our Blonde Espresso when we
introduced it. We stayed with the marketing campaign over an extended period of
time. And we saw blended continue to grow. And actually, that was a major part of
the comp focus in Q2, was the work we did around the Blonde Espresso
introduction. We learned from that. And we're putting that same methodology
behind our afternoon daypart to really gain some traction there in the afternoon.
Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.
{BIO 15144105 <GO>}
Scott, my question's on the G&A savings that you've outlined. And one, I just wanted
to conﬁrm your comment that you mentioned there could be a point of opportunity.
Was that a point of system sales or maybe a point of revenue? So could you just
clarify what you meant by that and sort of kind of gauge roughly the magnitude in
dollars? Then my second question is with that target. And I assume that would likelyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19

Q - John William Ivankoe
A - Kevin R. Johnsonbe a multiyear plan, does that change the algorithm on the earnings outlook relative
to the sales outlook versus what you shared previously as your long-run targets? Are
you able -- said diﬀerently, are you going to be able to deliver stronger earnings
growth at the same revenue levels given that G&A reduction plan?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes, ﬁrst thing I'd say, David, is it is a point of system sales and we're thinking it's
around that amount. We have some work to do to really get that framed up. And it
will be multiyear. It will take, as I said during the conference, my feeling is, no more
than a quarter or 2 to start getting some of that into the run rate. But it's probably a
2; to 3-year window that, that savings comes in. And again, we'll look to accelerate as
much of that as we can into 2019. And as far as the longer-term algorithm, obviously
this is helpful. What I would say is we'll come back as we get close to guidance in
2019 or for 2019 and take a look at what we think this means to overall earnings
growth in 2019. I'd reiterate what Kevin said, which is, we remain comfortable with
our long-term guidance. And clearly, going after G&A, some of the things that we
just announced on capital, some of the things that we're talking about around
accelerating comp growth, that all gives us additional conﬁdence in that long-term
guidance.
Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
The question is also on G&A. I mean, to go from 4.5% to 3.5%, whether on revenue
or system sales, I mean, we're obviously talking about big numbers. I mean, can that
be in isolation without revenue growth? And I guess in hindsight, when you look at
the organization and you look at eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness, are there any big
buckets at this point that you could have us think about areas where you could cut
and actually get bigger and more nimble as an organization? And obviously, I kind of
think about the 2008, 2009 time frame as you're able to accomplish some fairly
signiﬁcant G&A reductions and actually beneﬁt from such a change.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes, John, this is Kevin. I'll comment. I'll have Roz chime in a bit, too, because we're
really partnering and focused on this. Number one, I think there are a number of
areas in our business where we are under-automated. The technology to run some
of our back-oﬃce processes and things is just not in place. We've under-invested in
some things. And I think one big unlock is to utilize technology to help make our
partners more eﬀective, more eﬃcient and help make -- improve their experience at
Starbucks as well. That is part of the unlock. The second piece you touched upon.
Oftentimes, as I commented earlier today, scale and complexity gets in the way of
speed. And I think there are number of areas where I think we've got to either too
many diﬀerent organizations or too many layers or too many people working on
things when we can adapt -- adopt a much more agile approach to how we do
innovation. And maybe I'll let Roz talk a little bit more about that, some of the things
she's driving.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19

Q - Sara Harkavy Senatore
A - Kevin R. Johnson{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Right. So let me start by saying that we are taking a very detailed look at the routines
that our partners conduct in the stores. We're doing that for twofold. One is we grow
the afternoon daypart. We know we need to spread out the work across the day and
make sure that it's evenly dispersed so we have time for the customer as well as
preparing for the next shift in the business cycle. The second piece I would tell you is
that there are some complicated work that the partners have to conduct. And we
think that there are some routines that we can eliminate. As we look at the Internet of
Things and getting the work that they do automated, it gives us the opportunity to
eliminate some work hours in the buildings. So that just gives you some idea of the
ways we can improve the way we work and improve the operation eﬀectiveness.
Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
Just one question. And I do have a follow-up on the afternoon daypart, just a
clariﬁcation. But the question on the -- it's more about the digital relationships. And I
know you were enthusiastic about that. And that's going to be a big driver, in your
view, of an acceleration in comp. But I guess we've seen MSR membership grow
pretty healthily over the last few quarters and yet the traﬃc hasn't grown sort of in a
corresponding rate. I know you don't want to share your cards in terms of exactly
what you're going to do. But I guess where is the conﬁdence that what you're doing
now will be diﬀerent from some of the initiatives we've heard you talk about over the
last few quarters and the impact of growing those relationships will really start to
come to fruition? Then just my follow-up on the afternoon with -- health and wellness
isn't really a new trend in the sense of you haven't seen the Frappuccino business fall
oﬀ so quickly. Is it possible there's just a lot of competition in the afternoon daypart,
because a lot of restaurants are going after that.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes, let me take the ﬁrst part of your question, Sara. And then Roz and I can comment
on the second part. The ﬁrst part of your question is keep in mind that our active
Rewards members is a much smaller percentage of total customers that we serve.
The majority of customers we serve are more occasional customers or I'll call them
non-Rewards members. And so the fact that much of the comp we've been driving
Rewards members have been -- it's been a function of personalization and our
Rewards members. So the fact that we're opening the aperture. And we have 5
million of these registered customers now that we're engaging with. And we've got
to continue to drive that number up. We've got to continue to grow the number of
digital registered customers that we communicate with. The early sign that's giving
us conﬁdence and a proof point is just the response we've gotten to our reimagined
Happy Hour. And that is all driven out of those registered customers plus active
Rewards. But registered customers are signing up. They're getting the digital
coupon. And they're engaging with us. So there's a lot of great proof points that

Operatorcustomers as we can will yield results. In terms of afternoon daypart, before I hand
over to Roz, I'll just comment that the entire category of slushy coﬀee, which is what
blended Frappuccino falls in, has been on the decline. It's also true that competitors
have also come to market with that beverage. My personal view is we are less
diﬀerentiated on that beverage than we are on our core beverages around coﬀee,
espresso and tea. So the category is declining. There's more entrants in there. And as
you point out, health and wellness is not a new trend. But I think it's a contributing
factor to why the category is declining not just for us but for everybody. And it is why
I think we have an opportunity to be more agile innovators and do much more
around healthy -- healthier, better-for-you beverages in our core beverages that
allow us to further diﬀerentiate from the competition. And that's what we intend to
do. Roz, do you want to add to that?
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Yes. So Sara, the one thing I would mention is that as we learn more about our
customers and how they like to spend their time in our stores, the afternoon tends to
be a moment of refreshment and kind of a renewal. That's why we see teas and our
Refreshers doing so well. They tend to trend stronger in the afternoon. Morning
tends to be hot espresso occasions. So we're looking at those occasions very
carefully. And as we move towards tea, it is naturally a healthier-for-you concept and
gives us a chance to do some things with less sugar. It's deﬁnitely an opportunity for
iced beverages as well, which are doing very well. So we're taking advantage of the
trend and making sure that we're on trend with where the customer is choosing their
beverage in the afternoon.
Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim.
{BIO 3948570 <GO>}
I'm just curious about sort of the litmus test for the 150 store closures that you upped
the number from 50 originally. Will those be necessarily replaced more so by --
make room for some of the better located but newer stores to those markets? Or are
these markets that, in general, are lower-return overall markets rather than lower-
return stores?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes. This is Kevin. First of all, the criteria I looked at was negative comp and negative
total contribution margins. So these are probably not stores that get relocated or
replaced. You close them and there's other stores in the proximity and the traﬃc
goes to those other stores. So I think in our estimate, the majority of that traﬃc and
transaction gets backﬁlled by other Starbucks in the location, which raises the comp.
It raises the operating income and it raises the return on invested capital in that
trading area. That's the intent.
Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19

Q - Dennis Geiger{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
So I'm trying to bridge the gap on the $0.10 EPS revision. If you sort of reverse-
engineer it from -- and historically you've talked about sort of a 3% comp range gets
you to 5% EPS growth range or a point of conﬁdence at about $0.03 of EPS. You lose
$0.02 from the moving pieces you talked about in the Third Quarter, which really is
another $0.08 of reduction. Are you trying to imply that there's actually like a
multipoint reduction embedded in the annual comp outlook? Or is there yet another
headwind that that math is not accounting for?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes, I think, Karen, it's obviously multipoint in this quarter, which is, along with the
impact of the anti-bias training and the compensation changes, the biggest part of
the impact. Then the deleverage on the transaction piece that I mentioned at the
end of the conference, that is also adding to the pressure. So it's the mix of comps
and the absolute level. But the vast majority of the delta that we're talking about is
driven by the comp slowdown. And it's mostly in the U.S. There's a little bit of China
in there. But frankly, it's not really changing our outlook on proﬁtability or revenue
growth in China. We still see 20% plus revenue growth in China this year because of
the new stores. So it's mostly the overall level of comps and then the mix where
we're not quite seeing the transactions we'd hoped.
Your next question comes from the line of Greg Francfort with Bank of America.
{BIO 22252878 <GO>}
Kevin, can you talk a bit about the -- maybe help us understand the magnitude of
incremental market streamlining you're talking about. Then as you -- I think you used
the word other appropriate markets. What markets are you looking at? And is the
U.S. part of that analysis?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes. The U.S. is not part of that. Clearly, the U.S. and China are markets that are
better. We create more shareholder value by having those markets be company-
operated than licensed markets. Clearly, we have channel licensed partners in the
U.S. Channel licensed partners will continue. But I'm not referring to the U.S. and I'm
not referring to China. If you look at other markets around the world, there are not
many other company-operated. But certainly, if I looked at U.S., Canada Japan and
China, I think those are all appropriate company-operated. And without going into
detail, I think others are ones that might be appropriate.
Your next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 12A - Kevin R. Johnson
A - Scott Harlan MawSo just another one on the digitally registered customer opportunity. Certainly 1 to 2
points of incremental U.S. comp next year is signiﬁcant. Anything more you could
share on kind of what goes into that estimate, how signiﬁcantly the users could ramp
in '19? If you have any sense for what the potential pool of customers could be
relative to your 70 million customers. Then sorry if I missed it. But just how long
before you kind of gain information about those customers and then can eﬀectively
target them? I mean, is the targeted Happy Hour proof that it can happen pretty
quickly?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes, let me take the back half of your question. And I'll let Scott talk a little bit about
the comp calculation. The -- right now, the key thing that we have to get done to
allow the personalization engine to do its work is we have to now make the
connection from tokenized credit card transactions back to an e-mail ID registered
customer. And by doing that association, that allows us then to use the body of
software, which is our real-time personalization engine, to tee up the right oﬀers,
make them aware of the right products and start to dial in to things that are relevant
to each of those customers individually. And we've got a line of sight to that. We've
lit that up. It's probably another 90 days over this next quarter to get that in place.
Then we'll light up the personalization engine. So we'll probably have another 90
days of tech work and that connection to be made before we can really start
eﬀectively using the personalization engine. When we do use the personalization
engine though, I would say we have that -- the personalization software that has
been built in that engine, in my opinion, is an industry-leading asset that has been
created that we're leveraging. And so I have high degree of conﬁdence that once we
map the tokenized credit card transactions to an individual registered customer, it
will be as eﬀective as what we do in terms of personalized oﬀers to our Rewards
customers. Now we don't assume that they're going to be spending at the same
level of Rewards customers. We feel like as we deepen that engagement, they will be
-- this will be a funnel to have them join the Rewards program because once you hit
a certain amount of spending and engagement, it's much -- there's enough beneﬁts
for those customers to join Rewards. So not only will this increase the body of
customers that we have a digital relationship with. It will create a feeder pool to our
active Rewards members. The -- so right now, we are doing sort of general one-to-
many marketing to those digital customers. It's one-to-many e-mails to join us for
Happy Hour. We haven't even started doing the personalization. And even at a one-
to-many, it's exceeding our response rate and our forecast for the reimagined Happy
Hour. And so that gives us conﬁdence. Now that 5 million new registered customers,
that number, we're going to start to disclose to you every quarter. And I would
expect that number goes up and up and up certainly over the next two years. I think
we've got a long runway to continue to do customer acquisition of, as you pointed
out, the 75 million or so customers that visit our stores on a regular basis. Scott, do
you want to talk about the comp?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes, let me just talk a little bit about the proﬁle of that growth. And I'll try to thread
what Kevin just said back through, I think, both your question, Dennis. And the
question that Sara asked. So just to put the numbers on it, about 40% of our
customers today pay or transact with some form of the card, the vast majority of thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19

Q - David Sterling Palmer
A - Scott Harlan Mawbeing Starbucks Rewards members. Those are our digital relationships, okay? If you
go back 90 days, that was all of our digital relationships. What we're building now is
the other 60% of our customers. Oh, by the way, that 40% of the customers is driving
all of the comp growth. We've talked about that. So the other 60% of our customers,
as we've mentioned, is obviously in decline. And so the opportunity is how quickly
can we get that 60% to start going into the 40% digital relationship base, start hitting
it with the personalization engine that Kevin talked about, making one-to-one oﬀers
that are highly relevant and timely and driving comps. We know it's working. We're
not guessing it. We know when we can get those digital relationships, we can build
that capability over time. So that 40% will start to grow beyond Starbucks Rewards to
include today non-Rewards customers that are going to have a digital relationship.
And from my chair, it's the single biggest comp growth opportunity we have over the
medium term. And what I mean over the medium term is we'll see that start to build
and add to revenue this year somewhat. But as you look to that comp growth in that
1% to 2%, it will start to be a meaningful part of that 1% to 2% as we get through the
end of next year. As the personal engine builds, that 5 million starts to get much
bigger. Then as we tip over into 2020, it doesn't stop. I think the comp opportunity
actually has the potential to accelerate. As that 40% starts to get towards 45% and
50%, we know it's going to grow faster than the rest of the non-digital relationship
base. And so to me, this is a multiyear comp driver that will start to manifest itself
very clearly as we move towards the end of next year and then gain momentum as
we move into 2020.
Your next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.
{BIO 6061984 <GO>}
I'm really struggling with what that 3% in June means about your momentum and
how you think that your comps might be next quarter. And you mentioned that some
of the things that happened this quarter, the Philadelphia store issue, the delay in
your cold beverage marketing campaign and the training itself. Last year, you had
the easy comparisons late in ﬁscal 3Q because the Frappuccino Happy Hour
happened and you had a little bit of a hangover from that. So I'm wondering if going
into this quarter, you thought that 3% might have been a 5% and we should be
cautious about how we think about the exit rate going into this next quarter. Any
help on that would be helpful.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I'll give a little speciﬁcs here, David, without getting too much into the detail. So one
of the ways to normalize for some of the compares is obviously to look at the two
years. And so what we talked about in the last earnings call, just to thread all of this
through because I hope it will be helpful, when we look at Q2 results, what we saw is
comps accelerated obviously on a 1-year basis. But they also accelerated on a 2-year
basis. In April through the earnings call, we saw two years holding right at the level
we saw in March. So that adjusted obviously for Unicorn Frappuccino and all the
things we expected there. Then we saw a deceleration both in one year and two
years in May. And in June, both one year and two years have come back, not all theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19

A - Thomas Shawway to where we had forecasted. But we are seeing pretty strong momentum versus
what we saw in May. So that's how we think about it. So we've taken down -- and I
think I said this in the conference. But let me say it again. We have adjusted our 4Q
expectations down slightly given what we're seeing from a momentum standpoint.
But it's real momentum on both a 1-year and 2-year basis. And given all the things
that Kevin and Roz have talked about, we think we can build on that as we move
through the quarter.
Your next question comes from Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI.

What does it take until now for you to shift the unit growth rates to the more under-
penetrated markets? And when you've shown the return on the new units in the past,
there's been some decline in the U.S. over the past few years. But was there a more
profound shift in those more developed markets where the returns were materially
worse than what we saw in aggregate? I'm curious if that could have a longer tail
eﬀect on some of your more developed markets where the returns were lower than
we thought. And is it they're just kind of a longer tail because it was just...

Yes, look, I'll kick it oﬀ and I'll let Scott add to it. We've used these analytics. And the
data-driven approach, this is not a new thing. We've been doing this for some time.
And so the focus on most of our store growth going throughout Middle America and
then the South has been in place now at least for the last year to two years. And so I
don't see that as a signiﬁcant shift. We're just reinforcing what we've already been
doing this last ﬁscal year. Scott?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I think the only thing I would add is we saw only in the most recent vintage a slight
tick down in overall proﬁtability. And when I was in Boston actually in February, we
did highlight that, that downturn was mostly in those higher-density markets and that
the 80% that were drive-throughs were actually holding right in that same very high
level of proﬁtability.
That was our last question today. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Shaw for closing
remarks.
{BIO 17370352 <GO>}
All right. Thanks again, everyone. And just a quick reminder that our Third Quarter
2018 conference call has been tentatively scheduled for Thursday, July 26. Have a
great evening.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19
