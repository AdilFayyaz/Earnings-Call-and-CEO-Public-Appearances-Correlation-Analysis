Good morning. Welcome to the Walmart Stores presentation. I am Budd Bugatch
with Raymond James. With us today we have got Bill Simon, President and CEO of
Walmart US. And Carol Schumacher, Vice President Of Investor Relations. Without
any further ado, Bill, the ﬂoor is yours.
{BIO 21601363 <GO>}
Thank you, Budd; appreciate it. Thank you, all for having me. It is great to be here
today in warm Orlando and very, very happy to have escaped the freezing weather
and ice that has chased us out of Bentonville.
We will be making forward-looking statements so please refer to the website for
additional information. Hopefully this will be the dullest portion of the presentation
and not one of the highlights. So let's move on.
I feel compelled to talk about what happened last year, start with a bit of an
overview. But I don't want to dwell on it very long for a lot of reasons, not the least of
which is hopefully you will all have poured over the results. Clearly, we could have
done better in sales, comp sales, particularly, though total top-line in the US was
around 2% for the year. Some external headwinds and we talked about those -- snap
weather was a real challenge all the way through the Fourth Quarter into this week,
in fact.
Some internal issues. We started the year out with some challenges around
processes that led to staﬃng and in-stock challenges that we caught up with about
mid year. But nonetheless, always an opportunity to get better. And we're focused
on that. We were able to learn a lot and grow a lot about our current ﬂeet. And it isn'tFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-04

Page 2 of 11all bad news. We're working on improving -- I gave this number out at our analysts'
conference in October. And it still holds true today.
About 10%, our bottom 10% of our ﬂeet have an impact of between 90 to 100 basis
points on the whole year. So if we just had the top 90% and not the bottom 10%, we
would have been about 100 basis points in comp than we recorded. So we're
working on that bottom 10%, making improvements in that area. And we saw
improvements in the Fourth Quarter in those stores and expect that to continue.
Several bright spots: we grew market share according to NPD and Nielsen in every
category that we measure despite ﬂattish comps. And we had some real highlights in
our small stores, Neighborhood Markets and Express; in our eCommerce business;
in our fresh areas; and in our home and apparel businesses. So not all bad, lots of
opportunity to get better and we're going to be working on that.
I showed this chart in October and it is something I use to remind myself and others
that we are a Company of innovation -- innovation in retail; started when Sam started
with 5 and 10 and moved to discount; broke the model and rebuilt it with
Supercenters; replacing the discount stores. We launched two formats,
Neighborhood Markets and an eCommerce business around 1999. And now we are
on. And excited to be on the edge of a new transformation in retail that we believe is
going to be a new inﬂection point.
As we move forward we expect the Supercenter to remain vital. This is a powerful
beast in proﬁtability and in sales and it is healthy. Has its opportunity to get better;
clearly, we talked about that and we're working on that. But about 3200 units, 80%
of the ﬂeet. And they really perform well, particularly in this stock-up occasion that
we value to be about $585 billion.
We have the ability to ﬂex prototypes all the way up to 200,000 all the way down to
70,000 square feet. And we're doing a really good job with the stock-up trip.
Where we have been challenged is in the ﬁll-in trip, the in-between shopping trip,
mid-week shopping trip. And this growth in quick trips, about $415 billion in sales,
has been interrupted -- our growth, Supercenter growth in this area, has been
interrupted by a rapid growth in smaller stores -- dollar, drug, hard discounters and
others. Our numbers show about 11,000 in the last three years; 16,000 new doors
opened since 2005. We now have an opportunity with Neighborhood Markets
immediately and Express in the medium to longer term to really, really make an
impact in this area.
And I'd like to spend some time today that I have with you talking in a little more
detail about these two formats that collectively we have been calling small formats
but individually are really just Walmart stores -- little bitty Supercenters, medium-
sized Supercenters, all the way up to our large Supercenter ﬂeet.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-04
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 11Neighborhood Markets for us in the ﬁscal year that we just ﬁnished grew 40%. About
4 comp for the year; 5 comp in the Fourth Quarter. I'm not sure I know any other that
format that grew at 40% and had comps like this. Real pleased. This ﬁscal year we
project to do over $8 billion in sales in Neighborhood Markets.
Interestingly enough, when you compare sales per square foot of these stores to the
major leading grocery chains, we top the major grocery chains in sales per square
foot.
Also interesting stat for you is that every ﬂeet year of Neighborhood Markets that we
have from the ﬁrst year right on through the last year that are on comp had positive
comps last year. So this isn't being driven by the recency of the build, the comp
sales; every year group of the ﬂeet was positive comps.
Customers love the format. It is Walmart prices with easy access. And we're
describing this store as a hybrid store. And I'll get into more about that in a minute. It
is designed to not only compete in the grocery space but across a much broader
space.
Data, internal data shows that traceable tender and other sales sources show us that
we are capturing new sales dollars, new trips. And new customers when we put
these stores in. Interestingly enough, you can put a Neighborhood Market in close
proximity to a Supercenter and we see an additional $300 a year from customer
spend based on traceable tender. So this is additive to our business -- because they
are diﬀerent trips, because they are shopped diﬀerently. A stock-up trip at the
Supercenter on the weekend; ﬁll-in trip at the Neighborhood Market during the
week.
We also have had great success in new markets and with new customers who are
now accessing our brand in a more convenient way right in their neighborhood.
As I said, the performance has been really good and built throughout the year -- very
solid in traﬃc gains; great pharmacy business; our produce has been doing very,
very well. Every metric that we have been looking at is good in these stores. So we're
very pleased with the performance.
We had previously given guidance that we would be at $10 billion by ﬁscal 2016. I
think we're going to easily meet or exceed that, though I am not changing that.
Want to talk to you about the hybrid nature of the store. And this is really what is
exciting about it. It plays across a wide spectrum. They will all be enabled with fresh
food, fuel. And pharmacy as we go forward. Those are the decisions that we have
been made. Very eﬀective in urban and suburban locations for us. And they compete
against a wide -- a variety of formats. You can see the little chart across the bottom --
dollar, grocery, drug. And eCommerce. We have Walmart prices; we have gas for the
trip; pharmacy. And in each and every case. So it's a pick dollar as an example.
They've got prices but we have got fuel and pharmacy and fresh and connectivity toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-04
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 11our Walmart.com eCommerce network, which we believe is a competitive
advantage. So just sort of think about it, you can order from Walmart.com and pick
up what you like when you stop and get gas at one of these locations. Very
diﬀerentiated.
We see this as a great, great opportunity going forward. This format has a long
runway in front of it. And you will see us -- and you have heard us more recently talk
about the acceleration in this format.
Let me shift quickly to where we are on Walmart Express, another real exciting
project that we have underway. Walmart Express is in stages of learning for us. When
we opened the ﬁrst group of them in our ﬁscal 2013 it was -- if you build it, will they
come? Will there be top-line? What sort of traﬃc can you generate and what will
sales be?
Answer -- yes, they will. Sales have exceeded what we had projected and we're very,
very pleased with the top line.
During that timeframe we also tested a few other things: urban and rural. We tested
with gas, without gas; with pharmacy, without pharmacy. We have the best results in
rural and light suburban with pharmacy and with gas. And that is exciting for us. A
very nice model there.
The next step for us was to understand whether -- we can build is and they will come.
The second question is okay, can you make any money oﬀ of it.
So we built a dense group of them in the eastern part of North Carolina. And the
answer is yes, we can engineer the supply chain and operations to the point where
we like the proﬁtability. So we're pleased with that. And by the way, in the second
year they did really nice in comp sales.
The project we are headed for now is we have a paper model of what we think these
will be nationally and it is signiﬁcant. We now want to go to markets and determine
whether -- and validate that paper model of how many stores this will be by learning
how they interact and intersect in high-share markets, low-share markets; high-
competitive density, low-competitive density; and various ethnic-skewed markets. So
that we can then take the paper model, validate it with the real-world learning and
determine where and how fast to go forward with this. We're very excited about the
format, particularly the top line and we believe we can continue to progress on the
bottom line.
And this is, again, this is a full-capability store, has fuel and pharmacy and fresh and
10,000 SKUs right in your neighborhood, right in your ZIP code. And fundamentally
diﬀerent and diﬀerentiated from the other formats that would compete in that space
because of the breadth of the oﬀering and the connectivity that we have through
Walmart.com. That we believe we can build and are building into a competitiveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-04
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 11advantage against the entire spectrum of retail from pure physical to pure digital.
That intersection is a space that we believe is very strong for us.
Similar chart to what you would have seen in Neighborhood Markets because we
believe this too is a hybrid store. Again, competes well against all of the relative set
of retail competitors that they would have with a bit of a rural skew because we can
reach customers one more concentric ring out that we weren't otherwise able to do.
The connectivity that we are working at online is truly fascinating. It is work that we
have from learnings at ASDA, in the market in the UK where we operate. And we are
bringing this capability to the US. We have started as many of you would have heard
in Denver. And I will cover that later with the grocery pickup opportunity at our
Supercenters. Later this year we will be evolving into building the capabilities and
opening three markets where we have a fully tethered distribution system and a fully
tethered retail operation.
And I will just take a moment to explain what that is. A small store connected to our
Walmart network is a bigger -- which means the distribution system, the commerce
system and Supercenter network. So if you are on your way home today from
wherever you are, you can -- and you know you need to stop for gas, you can place
your grocery order to be picked up when you get your gas. And if you want a shovel
to shovel your way out of the driveway when you get home, because it's not this
warm everywhere in the country, you can also order that and it will be available for
you. We can do that -- by May we will have one market up; later in the year we will
have two other markets up. And that's a very, very exciting proposition for us.
We are testing and building new muscles in our real estate group. As you build small
stores fast and transition from Supercenters where we will still build some
Supercenters next year, though a large percentage of those will be relocations and
expansions.
But the muscle that we need to build in real estate -- lower cost CapEx, speed to
market, shortened construction time, has allowed us to accelerate the build out of
some of these stores. They have done a terriﬁc job in that group.
So when we met in October at the analyst conference we talked about -- I was asked
the question, would you accelerate this or can you accelerate it.
And we said, we were looking at it all the time and we will if we can. We saw that
opportunity and we added as you would have heard at our earnings release, around
our earnings release, a doubling of the planned growth. So we're going to add
about 300 or so small stores next year that consist of about 200 Neighborhood
Markets and about 100 more Express stores. The Neighborhood Markets are a pull
forward of an established pipeline that was scheduled to be built next year. And the
Express stores are much more easy to site. And you will see those open up in that
pattern that I described to you earlier in density and modeling of what would a
national rollout look like.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-04
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 11It is exciting. We think that we have come a long, long way with these two formats
over the last three years. We're excited about their opportunity. We believe they
represent tremendous growth potential for the Company in a retail space that is
deﬁned on one end by digital and on the other end by pure physical. These provide
the ability to compete as I have talked, across a wide array of competitors and many,
many diﬀerent spaces.
No need to build a drugstore. We have these. No need to build a dollar store. We
have these. No need to build a grocery store. We have these.
And as we were describing it, they are all Walmarts. You can call them Express or you
can call them little Supercenters. 10,000 items are available immediately. The rest of
the assortment is available through our logistics and digital network. If you want in
an hour, we can get it to you. If you want it in a day, we hope to be able to get it to
you the way you want it, where you want it.
Neighborhood Markets have about 25,000 SKUs; Supercenters more. But all
connected -- one Walmart from the smallest store to the digital realm. It's a very
exciting, very exciting time for us. As I said, another inﬂection point opportunity in
our business.
In order to deliver this we need to continue to build skills and muscles and strength.
You would have heard us talk a lot about each one of these things -- or some of
them, maybe not a lot about all of them. But these are the components that have
gone into and will go into how we go forward with these small formats and
opportunities for us to continue to learn. Building each and every one of these
things potentially as modules that could be dropped into large stores or in diﬀerent
locations or in new places or maybe just totally virtually scan and go -- mobile self
checkout. You have heard us talk about that. That is beyond the test phases and the
beta phases and in implementation. We have lockers that we use eﬀectively in the
UK and we rolled them out in the DC metro market. Customer response has been
very good.
Grocery delivery and pickup is something we have the capability to do. We have had
it at our business in the UK for a long time. And we believe that the US market --
when the US market is ready for that, we will be able to roll that out at a rapid pace.
We're really excited about a drive-through format. You saw us launch it attached to a
Supercenter in Denver. We're going to try some other interesting things with that --
standalone, attached to smaller stores, lots of opportunities for us to look at that.
Walmart on campus, we have a few of these -- interesting, wonderful little stores that
give us a lot of learning about how young people shop and how they carry their
habits forward when they leave the store. And convenience is an emerging area that
interests us as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-04
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 11Budd BugatchSo a lot of exciting things all coming together around one customer, one brand. All
the way from the one end of the physical realm to the other end on the digital realm
and our opportunity to serve customers the way they want to be served; where they
want to be served; and most importantly, when they want to be served all at the
Walmart price.
One last little bit here and I feel compelled -- because I won't go anywhere these
days without talking about the transformation that is going on in the US economy
today around the opportunity that we have as a country to reestablish a
manufacturing base here in the US. For us, this isn't a program although it has
manifested itself that way. This is real. It is economic. It is math. It is working. And
almost a generational shift because of the land, labor, transportation and energy
components that exist today around the world.
There is an opportunity for us to rebuild a manufacturing sector -- not in every
category, not in every place. But right now we are working on 140 active projects.
And we're not doing this as I said, as a P.R. program. If you can meet our standards
and our cost requirements. And make money you can do it in the US. And we are
seeing suppliers come to us. The emergence of the middle class in China and in Asia
in general has increased the demand over there for locally made products. This isn't
take a factory from one place and close it down and move it to another place. The
next factory should be built closest to the point of consumption. And if you think
about that, that is where we are. We've had great success in certain categories.
The best example I can give you because it was the ﬁrst one we announced was a
towel manufacturer -- 1888 Mills. We used them at one of our conferences -- at our
ﬁrst conference. They were one of the early movers in this.
And so a year later, here we are. We've now got that product in about 1200 stores.
We were able to get it to the customer fully loaded all the way for the same cost and
the sales of the product are up 24% over the item it replaced. So customers want it.
They don't need to pay more for it. Made in the US is viable and capable and we're
really excited about it.
Let me end the presentation before I take some questions with one of the best
television commercials I have seen in my business career. We aired these -- the ﬁrst
one on the Olympics. And it is for me, it is stirring. And I think it describes the
problem. The more people we can get that are involved in this eﬀort in industry and
analysts and in our fellow retailers, the better oﬀ we are going to be as a country.
And let's see if we can run that.

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantWe do have about 10 minutes for questions. And so let's take them from the
audience.
Questions And Answers
So I am curious about the Express format. The thought of it being more of a rural
market, you obviously have a disproportionate share in rural market. That is where
you dominate. So I would have thought that the opportunity would have been more
-- you can get real estate in Express format much easier than city centers where your
share is signiﬁcantly lower. So if you can just help me bridge those two.
{BIO 21601363 <GO>}
I am not saying that it is not an urban play. The Neighborhood Market is really
eﬀective in that space because of the extra square footage. And so we have been
looking for opportunities to build that format out in those spaces before you get into
the real, real small stores.
In those rural markets as we have described them for Express, the model when the
Supercenters were built -- and this is 10 miles from a Supercenter, would have been
no retail between here and there, right? Or maybe it is some local retail. But in the
intervening period there has been dollar and drug intercepting that trip. So the rural
markets are a great example of what I was trying to describe.
We have no problem with the stock-up trip in the rural market. Weekends and
evenings are really terriﬁc. The basket sizes are up. Our market share is pretty strong.
The mid-week ﬁll-in trip for a 15-mile drive for a gallon of milk has now been
intercepted by our competitors' build of some of these small stores.
And so we thought, well, let's go build a small store that takes that back. We didn't
really want to do that. What we wanted to be able to do was provide the same
experience that you get at a big store in a small store closer to the customer.
So now, I just view them -- you can call them Express. We have internally debated
about what we call them. They are mini-digital Supercenters -- virtual Supercenters.
The fuel, food, pharmacy is available immediately along with 10,000 fast-moving
SKUs. Everything else we sell is available digitally. So it is the full Supercenter
oﬀering. In fact, it is a full online oﬀering with a portion available immediately; a
portion available in an hour and one day and a portion available in a day.
And we are viewing Neighborhood Markets similarly. So you understand the trade
area, build the right size box; keep a portion of the fast-moving items right there and
then carry the rest through your digital platform. That is how we're looking at it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-04

A - Bill Simon
A - Budd Bugatch
A - Bill SimonIs the pricing the same between the large-format and the small format or are you
charging more for the convenience that you provide?
{BIO 21601363 <GO>}
It starts out the same. Let me put it to you that way. The aim is for it to be the same.
And we don't charge more for the convenience. Sometimes we actually charge less
for the competitive nature. So our thinking and our plan is -- we are an EDLP retailer.
We build trust that you can get the product for the lowest price. And in a market
where -- so we set the prices I won't say nationally. But we set them based on the
cost delivered to the store by large category areas, right?
So if you have a Supercenter 10 miles away, we start out with the same price in those
two stores. If the Supercenter is hypercompetitive against a store across the street to
the point where they -- we meet and we exceed -- we meet competition's pricing all
the time -- we may lower the price at a particular store. And so it might actually be
less here than it is here but it's not because this is higher, it's because the urban or
the more competitive intense store has lower prices where competitors have
lowered the price for an ad, or a week, or a period.
If the pressures would go oﬀ there from a competitive standpoint, the prices would
be the same.
But generally you are matching --?
{BIO 21601363 <GO>}
We match locally. And same thing with a small store. If you have a local competitor
who is selling a product for less than us, we will match that price. That is our business
model. So we start the same and then we match where we need to.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Bill, when you described the tethering concept at the analyst day, I thought it was
one of the most innovative things I've heard in a long time. And that project is
supposed to start this month I think. Is that correct?
{BIO 21601363 <GO>}
We will open the ﬁrst completely tethered store on May 2.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
On May 2. Okay. And explain that. Can you talk about how that works? And maybe
also give us a little bit of idea of the progress of the Denver and the San Francisco
tests.

Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 11A - Budd Bugatch
A - Bill Simon
A - Budd BugatchSure. The tethering is the full connectivity is, I guess, a shorthand for fully connected.
And fully connected to everything: fully connected to our distribution system; fully
connected from an associate/labor/store/assignment perspective; fully connected
from a supply chain perspective. And it is the digital thinking of physical retail. So in
digital, somebody orders something online, you ﬁnd out where it is and you ﬁgure
out how to get it to them the quickest way, the most eﬀective way.
So from a distribution perspective, the small stores -- you don't want to bring
everything to it on a 53-foot trailer. That last 10 miles for one pallet or two pallets
would be very expensive. Yet on the fresh side for example, we have enough to be
able to send a truck there. So hypothetically, the algorithm could tell you that we will
send pallets in 53-foot trailers for the fresh product. But for the dry product we will
cross-dock it from a Supercenter. And for the slow-moving items, we could ship it
from the Walmart.com DC to the small store to be stocked on a shelf.
So you could ship it from a fulﬁllment center, a dot-com fulﬁllment center to a small
store to be stocked in inventory, BECAUSE it is about widgets and cost from a
logistic perspective. What is the least expensive way to get the item to the store, to
the customer, or to the customer that we possibly have. And we have lots of diﬀerent
methods to do it -- the fulﬁllment center, the current distribution network. And the
development of a cross-dock operation from a Supercenter.
From an associate perspective, we are tethering today some of the functions in a
small store to a big store -- the back oﬃce function where you consolidate
receivables and cash and all the functions. You don't need to staﬀ that capability at a
small store. You can do it from a large store.
We expect in the model to be able to assign associates, should they choose to, three
shifts in a Supercenter and two at a small store that might be nearer to their home
should they want to do that.
All of those abilities for us I think are going to be innovative and serve to lower the
cost to serve.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
Okay. And the other one that was on the direct -- on the --.
{BIO 21601363 <GO>}
Yes. The numbers are in their early stages. The customer satisfaction and the
customer response to those have been very, very good. We have had about 90%
satisfaction on the service. Again, we're not charging more for service. On the
delivery side we do have a very low delivery cost, no subscription on the delivery
side. And on the pickup there is no cost. So Walmart prices with the convenience of
online. And that is really what we're trying to deliver and we are well on our way to
that.

Page 11 of 11A - Bill Simon
A - Budd Bugatch
A - Bill SimonAnd any timing on decisions on that?
{BIO 21601363 <GO>}
Yes, we're going to move as quickly as we can. We are going to move as quickly as
the customer demand is there. You will see us -- the tethering model in those three
markets is an extension of that test. It's just done at a new location instead of an
existing location. So you can pick up at a small store or you can -- in Denver you can
pick up groceries at a large store. So it is all in the evolution of it.
And when we reach a model or a module -- and this is really important -- that is
eﬀective, we're going to roll it out pretty quickly.
In Denver we went and put pick-up locations into existing Supercenters, sort of kind
of a module. We're going to try at some point the pick-up module without a
Supercenter, right, just a drive-through like a -- I don't know, kind of like a Sonic. And
we are going to try that pickup at a very small store in this tethering model in the
Expresses. So we're going to create a depot; we're going to attach it to a
Supercenter, testing all of those and then some of them will work in certain locations
and we will go fast there. Some of them will work in other locations. We're looking at
it as a bit of a modular play. We have this thing, we lug it on here, it works. We have
this thing, we do it here. We have this thing, it stands alone. This one is a pure
eCommerce. This one is a pure physical and everything else in between.
