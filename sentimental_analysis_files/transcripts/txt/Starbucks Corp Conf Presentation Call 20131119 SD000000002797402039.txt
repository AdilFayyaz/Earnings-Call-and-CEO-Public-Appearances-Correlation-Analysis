Good morning, everyone. On behalf of the Morgan Stanley research team I would
like to welcome you to this, our 16th Annual Global Consumer Conference.
My name is John Glass; I cover the restaurants. Over the next day and a half you are
going to have an opportunity to meet many of my colleagues in research, as well as
some of the leading consumer staples and discretionary companies in the world. In
fact, just looking down today's schedule you will get a sense of the breadth of the
conference starting with Starbucks this morning. But then quickly going to Procter &
Gamble, luxury goods maker Michael Kors. And then Lorillard.
In between those presentations we are going to have a few of our own starting today
at lunch our strategist, Adam Parker, is going to lead a panel including the analysts
talking about best ideas as well as equity strategy. Later in the day there is going to
be a panel on shareholder activism and ﬁnishing the day there is going to be a panel
from our trading group talking about consumer trading.
We are going to end the entire day with a cocktail party at 5 o'clock somewhere out
in the lobby out there. (Conference Instructions)
Let me quickly change hats and now make a quick introduction. I have had the
pleasure of following Starbucks since nearly it's time as a public company. In fact, I
keep still on my desk the initiation of coverage report that my predecessor wrote in
1992.
At the time, Starbucks at 140 stores in four states and one province of Canada. Had a
market cap of $340 million and what was interesting was in that report it boldly
stated that someday Starbucks would have 5,000 stores in the United States. One of
the few times I think sell-side analysts have actually underestimated something like
that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-19

the Company. Troy Alstead joined the Company in 1992 in ﬁnance. He was actually --
or 1991, 1991, early days. I think a very smart and wise move prior to the IPO and now
is the Company's Chief Financial Oﬃcer.
In addition, we have got Cliﬀ Burrows. He is the President for the Americas as well as
Europe, Middle East. And Africa. And the Teavana brand which recently opened its
ﬁrst store in New York City. Cliﬀ joined in 2001 and runs the UK business.
In addition, we have JoAnn DeGrande in the audience. She runs investor relations.
As well as Greg Smith. So with that it is my pleasure to turn it over to Troy.
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. It is good to be here and, yes, I was
hired in late 1991. So you are taking me back memory lane talking through that. I was
either very smart or very lucky at the time. Hopefully, I was a little smart. But I think it
was a lot of lucky to join the Company way back when I did.
Starbucks' heritage is in the Starbucks store. In fact, when I joined in the introduction
you just heard that is really what Starbucks was all about was the store. Starting with
a store like this in Seattle and a handful of other stores that back at the time, as you
know, was only about the specialty coﬀees and ﬁne teas and spices and coﬀee-
making equipment from all over the world.
Today we have 20,000 stores in more than 60 countries all around the world,
serving 70 million customers each week. And increasingly with a very strategic
leadership position in at-home and away from the Starbucks store coﬀee.
Over the last four years in particular we been able to produce very strong and --
both strong and consistent levels of same-store sales growth quarter in and quarter
out. That consistency of sales growth has been driven by product innovation, things
like beverages.
Often new beverage platforms such as the Refreshers platform which we launched
just a year ago. Hazelnut Macchiato, a new product innovation just earlier this year
that was right in the heart of our espresso category and yet was highly innovative
and highly incremental to the platform.
New product innovations which have been very hard-hitting and contributory to
comp growth, as well as those returning favorites. Our best example that Cliﬀ and I
love to talk about is Pumpkin Spice Latte. We are celebrating its 10th year this year. It
comes into the stores every year during the fall; goes back out again.
We are continually, frankly, even amazed internally at its ability to keep driving its
proposition, comping over itself every year. And, frankly, how it has become one of
those iconic products that many of our customers measure the seasons by.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 13When Pumpkin Spice Latte hits it is fall, when the red cup comes into Starbucks
stores it is time to think Christmas. We have actually become, in many of our cases,
some of those iconic products that really signal things in people's lives as we have
become more pronounced.
Food has been a signiﬁcant contributor, particularly over the past year, toward
quarterly comp growth. And that is, by the way, even prior to the La Boulange rollout
which we are in the midst of rolling throughout the United States today. As we have
up-leveled food in the last two years, as we have heavily focused on food oﬀerings
that are very relevant to the dayparts we have driven very signiﬁcant and meaningful
study contributions incrementally from food in the system.
Our loyalty program has been a great contributor as well, really an umbrella to
everything we have done. We have found a way with loyalty to engage and resonate
with our customers in ways that perhaps no other loyalty program really has, given
the frequency of that customer transaction and I think the natural loyalty people have
to that Starbucks experience every day. And there is no question the loyalty program
has contributed to a consistency of comp growth throughout this period of time.
Daypart expansion; while we have had very enviable, I would say, comp growth in all
dayparts, even during our busiest morning dayparts, the midday and the afternoon,
very consciously, very deliberately. And very thankfully have been stronger even in
the morning daypart as we are stretching those dayparts progressively over time.
All of that is in enabled by -- and you will hear Cliﬀ talk a little bit about this in just a
moment. All of that has been further enabled by work to drive productivity in those
busy morning dayparts, to move that line faster through technology, through
procedural work, through lean processes, through work routines.
Our ability to lift the lid on what used to be constrained, busiest half hours in the
mornings progressively continues. It has allowed us to drive productivity higher
every year recently and it has allowed us to raise average unit volumes in our stores
to levels that we don't really know what that limit can be now over time as we
continue to innovate across the store.
We delivered another strong result in ﬁscal 2013 as you heard us talk about in recent
quarters -- or in recent weeks. Revenue growth of 12% up to $14.9 billion. And while
we have been driving revenue growth very steadily over the last few years in
particular, expanding operating margin. 150 basis points of operating margin to that
non-GAAP 16.5% margin in ﬁscal 2013.
On the strength of that top-line growth and that margin expansion we drove 26%
growth in earnings per share to $2.26. We have drove earnings fourfold over this
span of time, as you can see. And we have found a way through the strength of
revenue growth and through the heavy lifting of continually squeaking out tens of
basis points throughout the middle of the P&L at every opportunity we can to drive
earnings growth consistently. Eﬀectively double the rate of our earnings growth.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 13And that revenue growth has become increasingly diverse. Diverse by geography,
diverse by business channel, diverse by daypart as I mentioned. And diversify
product category.
In the Americas, we have produced revenue growth of 11%. That is by far our biggest
business unit that we have. It continues to grow very steadily and consistently. In the
Americas this strength of very strong same-store sales growth and a moderate pace
of new store development as we go.
EMEA, which has been a more challenged part of the world for us, has been
improving and we moved into positive comp growth as we moved into the back half
of the year. And it is contributing once again to revenue growth for the Company.
Our channel development business, which is the business we are really planting the
seeds for that future growth going forward, as we continue to aspire to and
strategically go after an out-of-store consumption pattern, where we have historically
been underrepresented and we see a tremendous opportunity. And I'll come back
to that in a moment.
Then our China/Asia Paciﬁc business, our fastest growing revenue business, a very
healthy 27% revenue growth. That is driven both by a healthy same-store sales
growth similar to the level we see in the Americas and then also in China Asia-Paciﬁc
really signiﬁcantly contributed by an acceleration of new store development. Very
accretive, high proﬁt, high return on capital new store development.
Now while we have driven revenue growth, we have expanded margin. Each of our
four operating segments contributed to margin expansion over the past year.
Again, the Americas the most mature. Already high proﬁt, high-returning business
for us and continues to drive margin expansion. Again, contributed by the sales
leverage from that very strong comp growth and those elevating average unit
volumes that we have across the US system.
Then, also as I mentioned, the great work around continually looking for tens of basis
points of eﬃciency and waste management in the cost of goods line and the labor
line throughout the P&L.
EMEA, not unlike what we have done in the last few years around transforming the
US business if we go back to 2008 and 2009 and even into 2010. We are now in the
last 18 to 24 months approaching EMEA with that same kind of fever around
transforming the business and it is clearly paying oﬀ for us now.
As we grew margins every single quarter of ﬁscal 2013 we have reached again --
granted it's starting from a lower base. But a good improvement over the course of
the year. And we exited the year in that Fourth Quarter with a greater than 9%
operating margin in EMEA.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 13Cliﬀ BurrowsThe path forward in EMEA looks bright for us. It will be a bit lumpy as we go through
various initiatives of improving that business over time. But we are very pleased with
the trajectory we have. We see a clear path for us to execute to move that business
into the mid-teens and then progressively toward the upper teens over time. Well
within our grasp to reach that over the coming couple years.
Channel development, the business expanded margins in ﬁscal 2013. That is the
segment that we have that most beneﬁts from the coﬀee tailwind. Our retail
geographic segments have progressively, or proportionately less beneﬁt or impact
from coﬀee costs. But channel development takes the full beneﬁt or brunt of that
over time. And that is some of the beneﬁts that you see on that margin.
Then CAP not only the fastest revenue growing business that we have. But also the
highest margin business that we have in the Company.
Now just another moment about channel development. There was, as I go back all
the way to what I started the presentation with, a point in our history where we were
very content to be the world's premium operator of Starbucks stores, starting ﬁrst in
the US and then rapidly expanding all around the world. In recent years in particular,
we have strategically set our sights on all that consumption of our core products in
coﬀee and tea and those things that surround the coﬀee and tea and the
coﬀeehouse experience outside of the store where there huge amount of global
consumption and where we've always been underrepresented and undershared.
We are very excited to now strategically be going after that. We have had great
success in it in these early days. To have gained a 13% share of the US at-home coﬀee
market and growing. And that is heavily fueled by the leadership position we have
quickly taken in the rapidly growing premium single cup business.
Now, our ability to take the Starbucks brand and our products and what we do and
extend those outside of the Starbucks store happens because we build the brand
that we build those experiences and we create that environment ﬁrst through the
store in any geography that we may be in. The stores not only set us up for the
opportunity to then extend it into consumption at home and in the oﬃce and when
people are traveling. But the stores by themselves are also very powerful engines of
growth and proﬁtability with growing AUVs, growing four-wall proﬁtability, strong
incremental capital returns.
Now speaking of stores, I will pause for a moment. I'm going to turn it over to Cliﬀ
Burrows, who not only runs the majority of our stores globally and has responsibility
for those in the Americas and now in EMEA. He has been with the Company for a
long time as you know and I think is also the leader with the longest title within
Starbucks.
{BIO 6993941 <GO>}
Thank you, Troy. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It is a great opportunity to be
here.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 13I have been at Starbucks for 12 years. Started my career in the UK for ﬁve of those
years, moved over to take responsibility for Europe, Middle East. And Africa. No
sooner had I got there than I was requested to come to the US and run the US stores.
I started that in the beginning of 2008 and it has been an amazing journey.
In recent years I took on and expanded role to cover the whole of the Americas and
six months ago picked up EMEA again and our latest brand, Teavana. There are lots
of similarities around the work. There is lots of points of leverage, particularly around
the people and the operational approach to that work.
Delighted to be here today in New York. New York is one of those places that has
been incredibly good for Starbucks, has been very kind to us over the years.
Now a lot of exciting things are happening in Starbucks today. And all the time when
we are introducing this new ideas, new innovations, new programs my primary
responsibility is to make sure that we can handle it in our store environment and also
that it enhances the customer experience.
We have done a lot of work over recent years to simplify the work to make it much
more consistent. And also invested a tremendous amount of money in our stores,
hundreds of millions of dollars, to make sure they stay relevant and they can keep
pace with all the things we are doing.
At the same time very, very focused that we need the people, we need the partners
in the stores to be able to deliver and to manage all this change. So that has been
my primary focus over that time.
We also know that the customer really appreciates and is very focused on the
friendliness of the store partners; the taste of their beverage and it's made just the
way they like it. And also it has to be fast enough for them. So respecting their time
and focusing on speed is really important.
Just trying to get that whole balance, which is the Starbucks experience, for us. And
we know the quality of everything we do has to match the quality of the beverage,
which has been a driver of our business for so long.
We have also focused in recent times on our growth and we know it all starts with the
stores. We know we have an opportunity for more stores and all the opportunities in
the four walls with the new innovations make me really excited about the growth.
They also make me not only conﬁdent about the four walls. But about the
opportunity to continue to grow.
We always get asked the question, is the US near saturation. And the answer is very
simple -- not at all; we are not even close. Last year we opened 512 new stores in the
US.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 13The darker green dots are the stores without drive-throughs. So you can call them
cafe-only. And you can see how widely they are distributed around the country. The
light green dots are our drive-through. More than 65% of the new development last
year was in drive-through and that has presented a big opportunity for us.
Not everyone knows it -- we describe this as a company-owned market -- but we
have a third of our stores are licensed. We obviously prefer to own and run and
operate our stores. But we recognize that through channels, whether it is grocery or
through captive channels such as airports, we have to partner with people. And
more than 4,000 stores are in that licensed area and more than half of our stores
opened last year were in the licensed business. But the customer really tells us that
access and convenience is what is most important.
Now investing in the stores is not only in the new stores, it is about renovations. It is
about investing in new technologies. And I will just talk for a moment about drive-
through. We have focused on improving the experience.
The drive-through is something that we had. But it wasn't something we really
focused on. We have seen from best to worst, a huge opportunity to improve it. To
study what the best in the industry is doing has also helped us increase the
experience, enhance that experience and increase the throughput.
Sure, drive-throughs are more expensive by the nature of the site. They cost us more.
But we get a signiﬁcant improvement in the proﬁtability of drive-throughs. They are
about 25% higher in average revenues and they produce a good margin for us.
We have now got a pretty major program going on over the next three years, which
will be an investment in the physical space and technology to enhance that
experience. What you will start to see is live. And I think the highlight of this is the
live face-to-face video conversation that can take place between the customer in the
car and our barista who is serving them. They will also be able to use their mobile
devices to pay for the orders. And we think all of that helps enhance the experience
for the customer.
So a lot of new opportunities for us. The focus on the remodels in our stores, as I say,
we have focused on keeping those stores relevant. It has always been about location,
it has always started with the stores but we have kept pace.
And I think you will see we have moved away very deﬁnitely from the historical
cookie-cutter approach. Each store we make it locally relevant to the customer. We
try and use local materials and all of that is designed to enhance the experience for
the customer.
About 3,000 stores have been renovated, either minor or major, over the last two
years. Now when we do a renovation we have already built in the cost of that
renovation for a minor -- and a minor I would describe as a coat of paint, replacingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 13damaged furniture, to repair just keeping the store in good order. And that happens
usually every ﬁve years.
Every 10 years we do a major renovation, which is really putting the store back
together to deal with the many hundreds of customers who come into the store
every day. We don't expect to see a signiﬁcant uplift by staying relevant. We do want
to make sure as the portfolio ages it does not look like it is aging.
Where we do a signiﬁcant enhancement, increased space; put in an extra number of
seats. Where we change a conﬁguration to improve ﬂow, or where we are putting
something like Clover as an addition then, sure enough, we see an improvement.
Now the store and focusing on what we oﬀer the customer is really important. We
have talked a lot about La Boulange. But food has been a growing part of
signiﬁcance over the last decade.
Our journey started with really enhancing and introducing breakfast sandwiches into
our stores and they resonated with our customers. We have changed ingredients
over time to be much more natural, cleaned up those ingredients. We have brought
in oatmeal, which was a great addition, a very simple product to come into our
stores. And it enhanced the ticket; it enhanced the opportunity for the customer.
Food is important and we have got to deliver great quality food. In recent months
and over the last couple of years we have introduced salads, we have introduced
lunch, which has given again a much greater opportunity for the customer to access
the food they want. But just over 12 months ago we started to introduce La Boulange.
La Boulange starts with great quality ingredients. We have taken a point of view on
food and so far we have rolled out over 3,500 stores. We have put in not only great
food in the stores, we've also put the backend, which is manufacturing; we have put
in the distribution; we have put in the logistics to be able to deliver those products
to store in a way that they are freshest, in a way that they can be served with pride to
the customers. And also help us control wastage while we grow our sales. So we see
huge beneﬁts there.
We do see that we can move this needle to the mid-20s over time. But you can
appreciate we are not going to slow down the beverage sales to wait for food to
catch up. So this is going to be a convergence over time.
Biggest single opportunity building up a quality bakery is lunch. We have a very, very
small participation in the lunch market which is huge. So if we can introduce food
that is relevant, start to build a reputation for it, that combined with the innovations
around tea, the innovations around carbonation, around Refreshers, all helps us,
hopefully, build a second peak to match our morning daypart.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 13Troy talked and I will just talk brieﬂy about the productivity over time. If you look
back to 2008, you would have seen this eight transactions per labor hour. We base it
on transactions. So when you add food in it increases ticket. But we still expect and
we still ﬁnd ways to improve our productivity over time.
We will see this continue to grow. It is not only looking at how we do our work, how
we construct the beverages, how we put in the back bar to help support the sale of
food. All of that, plus lean principles and the investment we make in training our
partners, is all helping us to grow that productivity.
I have a real passion for retail. I have a passion for service. I have a passion for
merchandising. But I think one of the most signiﬁcant changes over time has been
our relationship with our customers through the Starbucks card program, through
the My Starbucks Rewards. And more recently through the digital ability to pay and
track the card and track the whole program.
We are seeing reloads on the card in the last 12 months, 3.7 billion on the My
Starbucks Rewards and the Starbucks card program. We have also seen that reloads
have grown 70% over the last few years.
More than 6 million people are active members on the card program and 4 million
are at gold level, all of which bodes exceptionally well. One in three of our
transactions is paid for by the card or My Starbucks Rewards. And we know in the US
about 23% comes from our most loyal MSR customers. And I think that growth in
digital is just the beginning.
The customer adoption; despite age, despite conﬁdence with technology people
are using it as their way into technology. So we have a lot of exciting stuﬀ and not
least is what happened on 85th and Madison. We opened just over four weeks ago --
just over three weeks ago, I should say, our ﬁrst new store.
We acquired Teavana, which is a mall-based business based on retail teas and
merchandise, that will carry on. This Teavana store is the ﬁrst of many and it brings
together the Teavana expertise around tea and merchandise, Starbucks' ability to
create a fantastic environment and now start to create beverages which we hope will
become a tea ritual to match our coﬀee ritual over time. Imagine what we could do
in tea if it is anything like our coﬀee journey. And you heard the very early days how
small we were.
So we are really excited about the opportunity that we have in tea. Tea today is only
8% of Starbucks' store business. Again, we think with Teavana in our portfolio it gives
us a huge opportunity to grow that segment to complement what happens around
coﬀee.
And I think ﬁnally just to wrap it up; we recognize we are adding more into the
stores. We are so proud of the people who work for us, the 200,000 partners every
day who put on the green apron. They are committed, they are passionate, they areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-19

them an enormous gratitude of debt.
Thank you for your time today. I'm going to hand it back to Troy to ﬁnish oﬀ.
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Thank you, Cliﬀ. Back in 2008 and 2009 when we, under Cliﬀ's leadership and
particularly in the US, took a step back and restructured and transformed the
business in many ways. And changed the Company from what had been a rapid
growth company for many, many years to what again is a rapid growth company but
in a very diﬀerent way today.
Today we are rapidly growing and heavily focused on driving same-store sales
throughout the stores by leveraging that existing asset we have, by growing through
dayparts, by extending product oﬀerings that still is relevant and core within that
Starbucks experience. We are driving growth and geographies. We are driving
growth in categories. We are driving growth in channels of distribution.
And while we have returned the Company now ﬁrmly into a growth mode, much
more diverse and much healthier than ever before, we have also implemented all
throughout the Company levels of ﬁnancial discipline like we never had previously.
That enhanced capability and ﬁnancial discipline has allowed us to consistently
deliver strong ﬁnancial results in ﬁscal 2013 once again with revenue growth of 12%
and 150 basis points of margin expansion and very strong earnings growth. It also
gives us conﬁdence in ﬁscal 2014 and the years ahead in our ability to drive
continued, disciplined growth and enhanced bottom line.
Once again in 2014 we are expecting double-digit revenue growth driven by mid-
single-digit comp growth and 1,500 net new stores around the world. We also
expect at least as much margin expansion in 2014 than we just delivered in 2013. We
delivered 150 basis points of expansion in 2013.
We anticipate somewhere between 150 and 200 basis points of margin expansion in
ﬁscal 2014. That revenue growth and that margin expansion contributes to our EPS
range of $2.55 to $2.65 with some oﬀset in there a bit due to a higher tax rate that
we anticipate in this current ﬁscal year as well as higher interest expense.
Now just a brief comment about coﬀee. Consistent with what we've been saying for
quite some time, ﬁscal 2014 we expect another year of coﬀee tailwinds. We have
virtually locked all of our coﬀee needs for 2014 at prices that will lead a net $0.09 to
$0.10 beneﬁt to the P&L this year.
It is a gross coﬀee beneﬁt, less some investments in the business, part of which is
and single biggest of which of those investments is the price reduction we took in
our CPG channel this past year, passing along some of that coﬀee beneﬁt along to
the consumers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 11 of 13In ﬁscal 2015 we do not have much buying at all having done yet into 2015. But given
where the market is at today, we would anticipate another year of tailwind in 2015. It
will not be as high as 2014. The peak, we believe, on our P&L is 2014. 2015 will be a
tailwind. But not quite as high.
There is a couple of reasons I should point out for that that I think sometimes are
lost, one of which is where the seed price is trading at today is, frankly, too low. It is
below the cost of production in some of the growing regions and in some countries
around the world. As we have done for decades, when coﬀee falls to that level we
have got a commit to our farmers to pay them what it really takes for them to grow
their coﬀee so that they can make a living and sustain what they are doing.
So as the seed price falls further we will beneﬁt not at all from the seed price falling.
In fact, we are not fully beneﬁting from where the seed is at today given that we will
support our farmers with incremental payments to make sure they can do the right
thing. We are in this for the long game. We are going to take care of our farmers and
the process. It is something we have done for a long time and are committed to.
One other element that is important to recognize is, as we buy 300 or 400 million
pounds of coﬀee every year and roast and sell that, a fair amount of that we roast
and then sell on to licensees around the world who operate Starbucks stores and our
food service partners. Where we do that, all that beneﬁt of the seed price reduction
passes along to the licensee. So on that 300 or 400 million pounds that we roast not
all of that reduction in price that we generate from year to year shows up on our P&L,
some of it goes to the beneﬁt of our licensee or food service partner.
We have been committed to and remain committed to investing into the growth
opportunities in the future and then balancing that at the same time with increasing
returns to shareholders over time.
In the last handful of years in particular, while we have grown the top line, while we
have expanded margins, while we driven earnings faster than revenue growth. And
while, importantly, we have been investing into the business in heavy ways --
investing in our people, in our capability, in our infrastructure, in a few acquisitions
here and there, investing in planting the seeds of growth for the future -- at the same
time we have signiﬁcantly increased our return on capital as a company, tripling that
rate of ROIC over the last several years.
In ﬁscal 2013 reaching above 24% and we believe we can continue expanding ROIC
from year to year as we go from here by virtue of driving growth. And in many cases
a less capital intensive growth going forward.
We have also been committed to increasing returns to shareholders. We delivered
$1.2 billion of cash back to shareholders in ﬁscal 2013.
With respect to dividends, we are committed to growing dividends over time, as we
have in the past years. Dividends have grown as earnings have grown. But we haveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 12 of 13also recently expanded and elevated the top end of that targeted payout ratio
range. And that elevation of that range just reﬂects the fact that we have a very
strong balance sheet, strong predictable cash ﬂow generation. We have got a
business that can aﬀord to continue to deliver consistent and growing dividends
over time.
With respect to share repurchases, we think about repurchases in two ways. The ﬁrst
priority of our repurchase program is to oﬀset the dilution that comes from our very
broad-based equity programs. Since we are a privately-held company we had stock
options that went out to part-time baristas in our stores and we continue to have that
equity program today.
First target is to aim to buy enough back in a given year to oﬀset that dilution and at
least hold the share count even. Beyond that then, where market conditions are
appropriate and where we think it is right, we will be in the market and take some
additional shares oﬀ the table from time to time. In any event, I would anticipate that
over time we will elevate both dividends and share repurchases.
We have a very strong, very healthy balance sheet. Healthy and predictable cash ﬂow
generation, both operating cash ﬂow and free cash ﬂow. A conservative balance
sheet in the fact of relatively little debt.
We have recently completed a $750 million debt oﬀering. We did that in advance of
knowing the arbitrator's decision. But we wanted to take advantage of market
conditions at the time. So that $750 million that we placed recently of 10-year notes
was at the low end of our ﬁnancing range that we were looking for. But we went
there, again, wanting to take advantage of the conditions at the time.
We will now, as I discussed last week, issue another $750 million sometime soon to
top oﬀ that recent round of ﬁnancing. The next upcoming $750 million will be in the
shorter end of maturities.
Then just to wrap it up, I would say I hope you have heard from Cliﬀ, you have heard
from me, we feel like we are phenomenally well positioned to move forward from
here given our responsibility in the business, our coﬀee leadership, our global
footprint, this powerful ﬂywheel we have created between the brand experiences in
the stores, enhancing that with the digital connection to the customer. And then
leveraging that into the out-of-store huge opportunity that we have to build going
forward.
We are positioned with a healthy balance sheet, a strong P&L. And an ability to
continue to drive growth going forward.
With that I will stop. Thank you for your time this morning and we will go from here.
Thank you very much.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-19
