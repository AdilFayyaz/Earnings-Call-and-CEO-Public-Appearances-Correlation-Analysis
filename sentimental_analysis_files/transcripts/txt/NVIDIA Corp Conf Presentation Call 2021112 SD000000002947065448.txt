Good afternoon. Welcome to JPMorgan's 39th Annual Healthcare Conference --
usually held here in San Francisco, but virtual this year. My name is Harlan Sur. I'm the
Semiconductor analyst for the ﬁrm. For the third consecutive year, we have the team
from NVIDIA presenting.
For those of you that don't know NVIDIA, they're a leader in visual and accelerated
computing silicon and system level solutions in areas like artiﬁcial intelligence, deep
learning, powering some of the world's largest supercomputers and driving
compute innovation for cloud and hyperscalers as well as larger vertical markets like
healthcare.
And with us today from NVIDIA is Kimberly Powell, Vice President and General
Manager of Healthcare at NVIDIA. She is responsible for the company's worldwide
healthcare business, including targeted hardware and software platforms for
accelerated computing, AI and visualization that power the ecosystems of imaging,
genomics, drug discovery and precision medicine.
Given the battle against COVID-19, the NVIDIA team has contributed its compute
acceleration solutions to aid in the ﬁght against the virus. So Kimberly, thank you for
joining us today. And with that, why don't I go ahead and turn it over to you?
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
Thank you, so much, Harlan. It's truly a great honor to be here as always. I appreciate
it every year -- and especially this year. I mean listening to the talk this morning -- and
it's just truly inspiring to see the tremendous global eﬀort to eradicate coronavirus
and build up a speed of the light response system.
As devastating as the virus is, it's really created this extreme focus on the healthcare
industry. Of course, in pharma and healthcare delivery, but government, academia,
start-up and the tech industry like ourselves have all joined together and trying to
create a response.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-01-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 2 of 14So today, I'm really excited to be here, and I'll share some of the critical role, really, of
artiﬁcial intelligence and computing across healthcare and what we think could be
truly 2020 was the beginning of what I'm calling the AI healthcare era.
So if we could advance just quickly, let me remind you of our safe harbor statement
you're all familiar with and for any forward-looking statements.
And on Slide 3, a picture we're all very familiar with, but let me put it into perspective
of understanding human disease and discovering therapies is truly the greatest
human endeavor. The drug discovery process really represents the incredible
complexity of this problem.
There's no equation for biology, and it's been an incredible past couple of decades
where we've set out to digitize as much biology as we can through things like
genomics and electron microscopy for 3D protein structure or cell imaging and
(inaudible) human data, all in the form of now digital data.
This is the amount of data we can produce today and more biomedical data in about
three months than the entire 300-year history of healthcare, as said by our fellow
partners at GSK.
And so this is now becoming a problem that no human really can synthesize that
level of data, and we need to call upon artiﬁcial intelligence to truly take some of the
next steps necessary in understanding human disease and discovering therapies to
serve it. And that's about biology.
And then you have to introduce, of course, the chemical space. As we look at the
chemical space, there's more than 10 to the 60 [ph] potential molecules out there,
essentially an inﬁnite problem.
And so again, here, applying artiﬁcial intelligence to discover novel compounds and
being able to stimulate and create digital and virtual microscope is something that is
being sought after by the entire industry at large. And so this is truly an artiﬁcial
intelligence problem and a computational problem.
And so we're really excited to be helping to advance our discovery through
computing in a drug discovery process, this very complex process where one phase
ﬁts into the next essentially making recommendations. And artiﬁcial intelligence
computing can truly help us bring recommendations and accuracy levels of those
recommendations better and better so that we can attack some of the major
challenges.
The fact that it takes about 10 years to bring a drug to market is far too long. So
accelerated computing can serve that. The fact that our success rate and the cost to
discover these things is far, far too high of a cost and too low of a success rate, this is
where artiﬁcial intelligence can come in.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-01-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 14And so without a doubt, this is -- artiﬁcial intelligence is the most powerful
technology force of our time. And 2020 really ushered in breakthroughs in
biomedical research driven by artiﬁcial intelligence.
AI (inaudible) achieved experimental accuracy in a lot of domains for the ﬁrst time
ever. Experiments are slow. They introduce human error, and you can largely not do
them in parallel like you can do in computers. And so increasing the speed and
resolution of predictions and simulations has been a tremendous breakthrough in
2020.
Let me give you some just incredible examples. Genomic variant detection. So
Google in their beat variant was -- has essentially created a universal variant collar so
that we can now harness not only short read sequencing technology but also long
read sequencing technology.
So it's a universal variant collar that doesn't require human statistical algorithms in
order to increase our single nucleotide variant accuracy. And NVIDIA, (inaudible)
have implemented in the Google deep variant, and the world is now leveraging that.
It's getting tremendous traction. And in the precision FDA challenge, the accuracy
levels were far better than ever before.
Virtual drug screening, being able to go through that -- what seems to be an
intractable chemical space of compounds and being able to do that at a pace where
the more molecules we can dock, the more we can discover.
And so (inaudible) and his team created a -- an application called deep docking [ph],
where AI and docking was able to essentially screen through 400 billion
compounds, and for coronavirus, discover 1,000 hits that are now going into the lab
there from UBC at the Vancouver prostate center. So 4 billion compounds,
something they can do now in a matter of a couple of days versus the month -- many
months that it would have taken previously to combining the eﬀects of artiﬁcial
intelligence and accelerated and high-performance computing.
As many of you have probably heard, the incredible breakthrough recently also of
Google's (inaudible), the second generation of their 3D structure prediction
algorithm driven by deep learning. Their ﬁrst incarnation of this was using (inaudible)
neural networks and -- which is more known for working with imaging data.
But recent breakthroughs in natural language processing and machine translation
known as transformer models, so things that really are more used in the area of text
and understanding text, they use those algorithms to make a truly breakthrough in
3D protein prediction -- structure prediction and achieved experimental accuracy.
This is just a tremendous breakthrough that could be very, very transformational to
the industry.
All the way through to a recent (inaudible) price, which is essentially the Olympics, if
you will, of accelerated computing and supercomputing, (inaudible) in the HPCFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-01-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 14COVID-19 consortium, they really put their heads together to say how can we use
artiﬁcial intelligence to drive molecular dynamic simulations. And essentially, they
were able to create what they call a computational microscope.
In computation, being able to see the coronavirus and how it enters the cell at
atomic scale and resolutions that truly no instrument actually can even produce.
There's just a handful of critical breakthroughs in 2020 where both see artiﬁcial --
high-performance computing and now being enhanced with artiﬁcial intelligence
techniques, creating tremendous breakthroughs. And what that's done is, really, it's
double the level of computing that is needed throughout the drug discovery
process.
From the right-hand side in the chart, our high-performance computing --
computational demand is increasing because the data is increasing, the length of
time scale is increasing, the way we can scale across supercomputing has been
increasing.
But now with this biomedical data values and bringing artiﬁcial intelligence into the
equation, we've literally doubled that. And so for each drug discovery organization, a
minimum of 10 petaﬂops of computing is now going to be needed, and that's just at
the beginning of this new AI revolution.
Artiﬁcial intelligence is really about software writing software. It's software that writes
software that no humans can. And -- but it's a little more than that. If you think about
artiﬁcial intelligence, and we even think about in healthcare and the practice of
medicine is intelligence is domain speciﬁc.
The data that you need in order to leverage artiﬁcial intelligence is domain speciﬁc.
It could be imaging to the genomic data. It could be electronic health. It's very
domain-speciﬁc and diﬀerent than consumer artiﬁcial intelligence that we know
today.
At the same time, in order to deal with those data speciﬁc features, you also need to
have algorithms and compute that are aware of that domain speciﬁcity. Diﬀerent
model architectures are used for medical imaging than is used for when you're
tagging a picture in your Facebook.
And we need to be aware of that and create the algorithms and the frameworks in
order to bring the domain experts into this artiﬁcial intelligence era. And similarly,
the task that artiﬁcial intelligence performs is also very domain speciﬁc. The
automation of skills, that truly is what artiﬁcial intelligence is. And you can see that
healthcare and the practice of medicine incorporates many diﬀerent domains that
are all incredibly domain speciﬁc.
And that brings us into what is the mission of NVIDIA healthcare. And our mission is
to bring the state-of-the-art computing approaches into the domain of healthcare,
and we've done that over the last several years with a computing platform we'veFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-01-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 14called NVIDIA Clara. It's named Dr. Clara (inaudible). She was the inventor of the
American Red Cross. It's a platform to help people.
And this platform is domain speciﬁc, and it's really in the center there -- visualized in
the center of this chart where you can see that pretrain models that are ﬁt for
chemistry, genomics, imaging, biomedical, natural language processing, these
pretrained models are one of the cornerstones of any AI computing platform.
It's where -- it's the starting point where you can now start to introduce domain-
speciﬁc data and train those models. And so in order to train those models, you
need what's called a training framework. And so we're built on the shoulders of
giants.
Facebook has largely developed an open source framework called (inaudible). And
we recently also announced (inaudible), which has been dubbed the pie which is
healthcare because there is so much domain-speciﬁc software development that
needs to go into this.
We've even created training paradigm known as something like federated learning
[ph] where, in healthcare, we know that the security of data is paramount. So how
can we learn from the data that resides in the walls of the hospital but not have to
move it or compromise its security, and we do that with something called federated
learning where hospitals all over the world can contribute to the learning but not
have to compromise their data security.
And then lastly, how do you deploy these algorithms in a hospital setting inside an
instrument, large-scale and a genomic sequencing center, on the cloud. This
deployment platform for where these AI skills want to live is very diverse, and it's
very domain speciﬁc. And so NVIDIA serves that with the NVIDIA Clara platform built
on top of our ubiquitous NVIDIA computing platforms.
NVIDIA's computing platforms are available in every public cloud, in every OEM data
center products. And even for a speciﬁc embedded low-power, high-eﬃcient
instrumentation, just like our self-driving cars are our computing problems go inside
of medical instruments, even handheld medical instruments that are now being
made possible because of our oﬃcial intelligence.
NVIDIA Clara as a computational platform for healthcare has gone through an
incredible expansion in 2020. You've known us for imaging and instruments for over
a decade. At the last JPMorgan conference, I introduced our -- introduced us into the
area of genomics.
And we've expanded into 3 other also very critical areas, natural language
processing, where tremendous breaks that have gone to super [ph] human levels of
performance to be able to -- and we made a speciﬁc biomedical version of natural
language processing, domain speciﬁc, so that it can be much more understanding of
the lexicon of healthcare, diseases, proteining [ph], all things that we just studiedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-01-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 14Wikipedia or Reddit, we wouldn't have that deep understanding on a biomedical
level.
This is going to be critical for taking some of the dark data in healthcare such as our
unstructured clinical notes or even the structured data on electronic health records
and making fantastic associations to lead us to better discoveries with language
processing.
We all sort of introduced Clara Guardian, which is a conversational AI platform. With
the incredible pressure that the coronavirus has put on our front-line workers and
our healthcare delivery systems, we need to ﬁnd ways to automate and protect
patients when a nurse may not always be able to be there. We can do that by using
voice, speech and vision systems that are -- were used to our everyday houses.
We have smart speakers. We have smart cameras that know who's at our door. These
same technologies with some domain-speciﬁc models and applications can be
made so useful to scale our healthcare workers. Whether it's scale as a patient
assistant, where a patient can ask, what is my procedure today?
Am I allowed to have water instead of having to call a nurse to get that information?
Or how can we be able to monitor patients both for their safety if they're going to
fall or their vital signs? All can now be done through some of these smart sensors,
and we've introduced the platform for that, and we had tremendous uptick in it.
And then ﬁnally, what I'll talk to you about in just a moment is our drug discovery
platform called Clara Discovery. With the addition and massive expansion to NVIDIA
Clara, we have ﬁvefold increased our downloads in just 12 months. It's just been an
amazing year, and the response from academia, start-ups industry in leveraging our
platform to have critical breakthroughs is amazing.
We made another record breakthrough with over 1,000 NVIDIA inception AI
healthcare start-ups in our program. NVIDIA is in contact and in a member program
of a virtual accelerator.
We have over 7,000, but over 1,000 of those are in healthcare alone. And we've also
reached a critical milestone and critical mass of over half a million NVIDIA GPU
instruments out there and deployed for this industry and to serve both clinicians and
patients and understanding and ﬁguring out how to treat them in most eﬃcient way
possible.
So introducing NVIDIA Clara Discovery, just at the tail end of last year, it's an AI
computational drug discovery platform. Again, it really builds upon the last 10 years
of NVIDIA Healthcare. Everything that we're working on, whether it be in imaging or
genomics, is truly in service of drug discovery because it's such a multidisciplinary
and such a complex problem.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-01-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 14We partner with the industry leaders, whether it be in 3D structure prediction,
applications and platforms or whether it be in simulation. We partner where the
applications are being built to make sure that they can scale, run as fast as they can,
be as accurate as possible. Where no solutions exist, we've gone oﬀ and built them.
With NVIDIA, Parabricks [ph] and our rapid platform in genomics, again, our rapid
GPU accelerated data science platform for searching the chemical space and doing
docking, again, our own biomedical, bio megatron, natural language processing
algorithms, and of course, our Clara imaging platform, all of this connected in to
really reimagine this drug discovery process, which is AI and computationally driven.
The AI-driven Doug discovery process is being adopted and driven by the world
leaders in drug discovery. This is just an incredible snapshot of some of the
innovators in AI drug discovery that are truly looking at each and every corner of this
process and learning how we can do things better, faster, cheaper, with more
accuracy.
An example of Regeneron Genomics Center, they initiated that genomics center
because they understood that genomics could really be critical in doing better
target discovery, being able to make genomic and phenotypic association to
enhance their target discovery, which literally starts the entire process of drug
discovery and harnessing that genetic data information.
They use NVIDIA Clara Parabricks to generate the world's largest whole (inaudible)
database of 200,000 whole (inaudible), and they were able to compute that in just
under a week. Regeneron Genomics Center is one of the most highest throughput
genomic centers in the country, and they really saw the accuracy gains of using deep
variants in terms of the single nucleotide accuracy as well as the speed and scale
that NVIDIA Clara can bring to them.
Structura Biotechnology, their platform is instrumental in cryo-electron microscopy
and using AI-driven 3D reconstruction to build 3D protein structures. In fact, the
team who started this company was the ﬁrst to build the 3 structure of the COVID-19
spike protein. And because of the speed and artiﬁcial intelligence, they were able to
do that in 12 days, something that just a few months ago would have taken a few
months to do.
When we're in a race against time, which, of course, the coronavirus has created that,
what artiﬁcial intelligence and accelerated computing can do is create a time
machine.
Relay Therapeutics has used NVIDIA's GPU data science platform to really be able to
interactively explore the chemical space to be able to look at millions of compounds
in an interactive manner such that they can make better decisions into the rest of the
compound discovery and lead optimization hit to lead process.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-01-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 14And it's just an amazing accomplishment to say something that would have taken
hours or days and turning that into seconds, which really transforms the way that we
are going to work, and it allows us to open our aperture where we have 10 of the 60
chemical (inaudible). Continuing to open our aperture is going to allow us to feed
more and more drug discovery.
Adam Weiss [ph], another leading start-up company, has invented Adam Net [ph].
And Adam Net is able to screen 16 [ph] million compounds in under two days. So
this ability to then take and open the aperture and understand what drugs we should
be docking and then sampling all of those into this massive screening so that we can
better -- lead to better outcomes of what we're going to feed into, again, the next
phase of the drug discovery process.
Vyasa [ph] leveraging NVIDIA's biomedical NLP [ph] so that we can help synthesize
all of the incoming COVID-19 data. There's dozens of papers being written every day,
and systems like theirs that can leverage both the literature and the real-world data
that's coming in to help us have a better understanding for both vaccine and therapy
discovery.
Schrodinger [ph] has been pioneering the spaces of simulation, one area of binding
free energy with their FEP calculations being at the cornerstone of what they do for,
increasing and doing better lead optimization.
And over the years, introducing AI into the platform and increasing FEP into absolute
calculations, they're able to really transform not only the amount of throughput of
the system, but also the accuracy and success rates of simulation.
And then Recursion [ph], another leading-edge company here who really
understand -- sees how being target agnostic is also another approach to drug
discovery, where being able to build the world's largest now digitizing biology,
building the world's largest human cell imaging data sets and putting to the power
both automation to build those data sets and then machine learning to extract
features out of the data sets of high (inaudible) screening and being able to really
reimagine the drug discovery process through digitization of biology. So these are
just a few examples of just incredible breakthroughs by the world's innovators and
AI-driven drug discovery.
We know that drug discovery and the amount of computing and the complexity of
the computing also needs its own and new instruments. NVIDIA has recognized that
the U.K. is one of the most innovative and, really, a melting pot for AI and healthcare
innovation in the world that we have decided to build the computational instrument
for AI healthcare called Cambridge 1 [ph] and AI supercomputer in the U.K. The U.K.
is known for discovering the structure of DNA.
I mean, they are pioneering in so many forms of healthcare, one of the world's
largest healthcare systems, home to some of the most important pharmaceutical
companies in the world and even amazing technology companies like OxfordFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-01-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 14Nanopore who are reimagining genomics in incredible ways. And we're building the
supercomputer so that we can partner with these industry pioneers on very large-
scale AI research.
Artiﬁcial intelligence requires this new computational instrument. This computational
instrument is built with NVIDIA's DGX superpod. It's essentially a data center as a
product. And this supercomputer will be the U.K.'s fastest AI supercomputer and the
world's top 5 green supercomputers. It'll have over 80 nodes inside with 400
petaﬂops of AI compute.
We've selected the site. The system is being built. We're delighted that it's being
powered by 100% renewable energy. And we'll invite you to our GPU technology
conference in April to hear about some of the initial work with these fantastic
partners that we're going to do on it.
This resource is going to serve as a hub so that we can do large-scale research with
the industry, but that we can also collaborate with universities and start-ups in the
U.K. and educate the future AI practitioners in the healthcare domain. So very
excited about this. It's the world's largest AI supercomputer, dedicated to healthcare,
and it's in a perfect location in the U.K. to do so.
It was another -- it was a record year for AI healthcare start-ups in 2020. Not only did
Q3 break every other previous quarter in terms of funding over $2 billion in a single
quarter and is expected to be well over $5 billion in total funding as opposed to the
$4.2 billion in 2019. Just a tremendous year. And it also fuels the NVIDIA inception
program where we connect with every AI start-up as a virtual accelerated program
NVIDIA inception.
We provide them training, early access, technical integration into industry platforms
as well as introducing them to our industrial collaborators. We've increased fourfold
in just a few short years, and we broke through 1,000 and ended the year at 1,095 AI
start-ups in our start-up program.
And these companies are coming from all areas of healthcare. And you can imagine,
digital health is an incredibly important sector now that we are in a pandemic where
virtual healthcare needs -- and synthesizing all of this incredible data is important. So
the funding in that domain incredible.
Imaging and instruments so that we can create new instruments that have never
been thought of before through artiﬁcial intelligence. Caption Health is the ﬁrst AI-
guided ultrasound that can be used by a nontrained professional to perform a
cardiac exam. FDA approved. So critical, actually, on the front lines of COVID-19
where a nurse is treating a COVID patient can now also administer a cardiology
exam because we know that this virus aﬀects the cardiac behavior.
And so being able to capture that as a front-line worker instead of having to move
the patient around or have it being done by another healthcare professional, justFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-01-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 14incredible, and dozens of industry ﬁrst just got AI. The ﬁrst application to be
reimbursed by CMS. So, so many dozens of industry ﬁrst. This is just an incredible
breakthrough year.
And the practice of medicine and AI in the practice of medicine is what is the future.
Healthcare spending is reaching an all-time high. We continue to have aging
population and growing population, chronic disease management, and we haven't
even gotten to prevention yet. But there is such a great, bright future, and you can
see that.
Look at the AI papers submitted to PubMed in 2020. This is an exponential growth.
And it's all areas of medicine. And what we need to remember about artiﬁcial
intelligence, like the practice of medicine, is it's constantly learning. Like the practice
of medicine, we want to learn from the patient before even.
The doctor -- we want to learn from the data. We want to learn from the changing
environment. And so that means that in a continuous learning environment and
computation, we need to become software-deﬁned, and that's what NVIDIA platform
provides to this industry so that we can continuously learn and deploy these AI skills
into the domains that need them.
So there's a software-deﬁned AI instrument revolution going on right now. As you
know, so much of the way that we work in the practice of medicine is driven by
instruments. And we're seeing new instruments we couldn't even have dreamed of
just a couple of years ago, whether it be smart cameras for monitoring patients and
vital signs or handheld genomic sequencers or a portable MRI device or an AI-
guided ultrasound.
And these NVIDIA computing platforms allow for -- an artiﬁcial intelligence allow for
these instruments to not only one being innovated in the ﬁrst place and secondarily
to be constantly learning and improving over time.
And such a great example of that is we're announcing today with Oxford Nanopore
technologies they've adopted NVIDIA DGX for their ultra-high throughput per
(inaudible) instrument. This is truly a breakthrough device as is all of their other
instruments.
This one in particular, coupling up with our supercomputer, the AI supercomputer
DGX station, it's a real-time sequencing instrument, and it's all AI driven. If you look
at the chart, the ﬁrst leap they had in performance came from adopting deep
learning in the ﬁrst place.
And then through models and training -- diﬀerent architectures and training, they
were able to achieve some incredible breakthroughs. So not only is it high
throughput at 10 terabasis and can do 100 human genomes per run.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-01-12

Page 11 of 14A - Harlan SurBut through deep learning, they're base calling, Bonito [ph] is able to reach an
overall accuracy of 98.3%. And AI-driven single nucleotide variant calling gets them
to 99.9% accuracy.
And here's a technology and instrument that truly touches on the entire practice of
medicine. Whether it be the COVID epidemiology applications for COVID-19 testing
that they have recently had a breakthrough on, they were always used for the viral
sequencing so we can understand the mutation and the spread of coronavirus but
also in human genetics. And long-range sequencing is going to be so incredibly
important -- is already so incredibly important in cancer research.
So in summary today, we believe AI and computing is enabling the AI healthcare era.
We are excited about Cambridge 1 in partnering with the world leaders, not only in
the U.K., but also the NVIDIA ecosystem of innovators in AI drug discovery.
Our NVIDIA Clara platform has expanded far beyond imaging and instruments into
genomics, natural language processing, patient monitoring and drug discovery. Our
start-up program is vibrant as ever. And we're so proud and excited to be working
with Nanopore on this next -- this third generation of sequencing of long read
sequencing.
So with that, Harlan, I'll turn it back to you, and we can take some questions.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Great. That was a great presentation. Thanks, Kimberly. So I'll start it oﬀ with the ﬁrst
few questions and those -- for those investors on the digital conference website,
please input your questions via the Ask A Question portal, and I'll get them in real
time.
So ﬁrst question, the NVIDIA team rolled out its next-generation compute
acceleration platform in the middle of last year, the A100 platform. It's based on the
Ampere architecture, leading-edge 7-nanometer silicon technology, been adopted
by all of the top cloud and hyperscale titans in many of the high-performance
computing initiatives, as you mentioned, the Cambridge 1 [ph] platform.
Last quarter, enterprise and end market verticals like healthcare represented more
than 50% of the team's data center business. So maybe can you just give us a
snapshot of your healthcare franchise?
How large is your healthcare franchise relative to the size of your overall data center
segment? How many professional support the healthcare segment? And how fast
has the business been growing over the past few years?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-01-12

Page 12 of 14A - Kimberly Powell
A - Harlan Sur{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
Yes. Sure. Let me talk to you about it, Harlan. So number one, Ampere is absolutely
the most incredible technology NVIDIA has ever brought to market. And it has
brought us tremendous growth. It's an architecture that is a universal GPU. It serves
all the computational domains that are needed.
Especially if you think about drug discovery, you need accelerated computing. You
need artiﬁcial intelligence. You need data science. You need computer visualization.
NVIDIA is world-class at those, and Ampere brings all of those, and we're world-class
at it. So the growth at Ampere has been tremendous.
We don't break out our individual industry sizes. Hopefully, you can see from what I
just shared that there is just a tremendous amount of eﬀort growing in healthcare.
Everything we've done for the last 10 years has really been in service to help, one,
respond to the pandemic, but two, to imagine now a brand-new AI computer-driven
drug discovery process.
As I said, understanding disease is the ﬁrst thing we have to do and then discovering
the therapy. These are the greatest endeavors of our time. And where they're -- as I
said, there are not -- there are no equations to describe biology, but we're able to
now digitize more and more biology, bringing that data together through
computing platforms. This is going to be huge growth.
And as I've heard articulated, the bar for the minimum amount of compute needed
in these discovery organizations, it doubled overnight because of these AI
breakthroughs. And this tremendous focus on AI on a singular problem in 2020 like
COVID-19, it really just showed us that with that tremendous focus, we could see
every piece and parts that can beneﬁt from artiﬁcial intelligence.
And what we've discovered over the last 12 months is only going to propel us further
in the future. Everything we learn is applicable for every future drug discovery
program there is. So the future is tremendously bright. Ampere is our most
impressive architecture yet.
And now it's ubiquitous. And so we're fortunate that it's so ubiquitous that any
researcher can get their hands on it, and we continue to enhance our software
platforms to really recruit and hopefully delight more and more software developers,
especially in the domain of healthcare.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
And then from a product level perspective, beyond the DGX system and the NVIDIA-
based high-performance compute cluster, like the Cambridge 1 [ph], for example,
your team also leverages its entire portfolio like the Jetson [ph] platform for medical
instrumentation, your EGX platforms for edge computing, describe how your team
leverages this portfolio to increase your share of your customers wallet over time
and maybe give us a few examples if you have them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-01-12

Page 13 of 14A - Kimberly Powell{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely, I can. And I think, Harlan, you kind of just touched on it. Because we
build on the shoulder of the giant core of NVIDIA, where we can -- that is our mission
statement at NVIDIA to take the state of the art and bring it to the domain, we get to
leverage everything that our company is well class at. Everything we learn in self-
driving cars and robotics, we can now apply that into the healthcare industry.
And so the other fortunate position that NVIDIA has built ourselves into being an we
have one architecture. We have one singular architecture that you can build your
application once and you can deploy it wherever your business model feels it should
be deployed.
If you would like to embed the GPU into your medical instruments and sell it that
way, you can do that. If you would like to decouple compute and have your
instrument at more like a sensor and augment it with the computer, we have edge
computing for that. We have -- all of our platforms are available in the cloud.
So what this allows our customers to do is really take advantage of their software
development in a way that they can scale it to ﬂeets of or market segments that have
completely diﬀerent business models.
And you can reach diﬀerent marketplaces. You can reach diﬀerent economical -- the
way people want to buy and consume CapEx, OpEx, you -- the business model in
our completely change.
Software-deﬁned, just like we've seen in the automotive industry, the Tesla model, if
you will, right, where it continues to retain its value and get better over time,
absolutely, every medical instrument should be this way. So we get to leverage our
(inaudible).
Actually, Oxford Nanopore, which I just ended on, is a perfect example of a customer
that has been able to leverage and innovate across diﬀerent price sectors in their
product. They have a handheld sequencer that cost $1,000 and requires no
additional infrastructure.
This sequencer can go into the ﬁre ﬁelds and jungles and faraway places that
otherwise would never have genomic sequencing accessible to it. And that's
because artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms allow them to shrink the compute and able
to still deliver what's needed for information out of those sequencers.
And the same application can go into a desktop into the very ultra-high end and
high throughput device that we just talked about. So they're a perfect example of
how we can see that. You can innovate. You can -- you penetrate in the market. You
can access new customer bases altogether by leveraging a single architecture and
compute platform like NVIDIA.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-01-12

Great. Well we're just about out of time, Kimberly. I want to thank you for the -- we
could -- I could go on and on with you about healthcare. It's such a fascinating part
of NVIDIA. But I want to thank you for the insights today. Thanks to you and the rest
of the NVIDIA team for your critical eﬀorts in the healthcare sector. We hope to have
you back next year.
