Good afternoon. Thanks for joining us. I'm Peter Stabler and I'm joined by Ken Sena
here. We cover Internet, Internet advertising for Wells Fargo. And we're very excited
to have with us today Gary Briggs, Chief Marketing Oﬃcer of Facebook. Gary's been
with Facebook for just about 4.5 years. And prior to Facebook, he has run marketing
operations for a who's who of world-class brands, including Motorola Mobility,
Google Consumer Marketing, eBay, IBM, Pepsi and began his career at McKinsey.
Gary, thanks for joining us.
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Thanks, Peter, yes.

{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
So I just wanted to start, if you think about Facebook, 2 billion users. WhatsApp, 1.3
billion users. Messenger, over 1 billion users. Instagram, closing in on 1 billion users. It
sounds like you've won the marketing game. Why does Facebook need a CMO?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
I get that a lot, particularly at cocktail parties. One of the -- I usually say that's why
they hired me, because that's -- works out that way. But I think one of the things that
we've particularly been focused on is getting people who are using these apps to
understand them more deeply, use them more deeply. So you certainly -- one of the,
obviously, the keys to apps and software is retention. And we've been very fortunate
to have very good retention. But part of that retention is people understanding the
products better, using the products more deeply and that's where we're focused.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

So you're probably, in your seat, best positioned among any of the marketers we talk
about to comment on the digital transition. And across the landscape, I think a lot of
investors are seeing some really storied marketers, let's say, in the CPG space,
stepping back this year and reevaluating their processes. We have a number of
activist investors involved. Wondering if you could comment kind of broadly from
where you sit, on where are we in this digital migration, who gets it and who doesn't?
And what has to happen for more analog marketing to go digital?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Sure. I mean, I think the -- and by the way, to the audience, I apologize. I'm getting
over a chest cold. So I don't always sound like this. And altitude has a certain impact
on chest colds. I can't wait to get to sea level again. But the -- but I think there's a few
things. First of all, I ﬁnd, as somebody who's been working in marketing since the
mid-80s, that the consumer Internet is over 20 years old. And I think the moves
towards overhauling marketing organizations have been way too slow. And right
now, we're in this period where I think 4 of the largest CPG companies in the world
have activist investors. And really, what's going on is they're being impacted by
companies that are coming in, whether it's shaving, toiletries broadly, housewares,
you're going to see this in more and more consumer products, where they're being
really impacted by companies that are coming in and using a diﬀerent way to get to
people than traditionally has been done. I think to change, I think these companies
have to fundamentally overhaul their marketing organizations. And if you talk to
CMOs of other companies, one of the questions I think is an insightful one to ask
them is literally who sits around. And the people who should be sitting around are
the folks who understand data and analytics as much as the people who understand
brand and advertising. And typically, folks who are kind of, of my age group who
work in marketing, they're surrounded by the brand and advertising people. Unless
you have a really strong quantitative capability in your marketing organization, you're
probably not making the move fast enough. And it is extraordinary still where those
folks often are in the technology organization, they're not even in marketing. They
don't have the capabilities to do that. So that's, I think, a big change. And that
organizational change needs to happen more quickly. But the companies that are
doing this well are the ones that you might imagine, that are, particularly, the ones
that are more mobile-centric, apps like Airbnb, Uber, Lyft. Companies like booking --
or Priceline Booking have done a really good job we see in terms of they're very
much companies that, in their marketing organizations, can do 2 things well, which is
they're very good at driving conversations with their consumers and they're very
good at quantitative marketing.
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
Do you think the pace of change is really posing a signiﬁcant problem for them?

For which company?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

For these legacy marketers, right?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Yes, yes. I mean, I think they...
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
Facebook is introducing new ad products on almost a daily basis. You're introducing
new targeting capabilities on a weekly basis. Do you think that, that has
fundamentally changed the ability of these marketers to kind of keep pace with
consumer habits?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
I don't know if that's as much -- I mean, one of the things we're trying to do is
respond to our customers to build products that are easier to use; have better
returns for them; and obviously, scale quite well, given the user bases that we have
and the folks that they want to reach. So we work with ad agencies quite broadly. We
work with our marketing partners, which we call SMPs, quite broadly around the
world and are doing that as a way to help large advertisers and also SMBs to scale
quickly with us. So part of what's behind our innovation is to be the best advertising
platform available. And so we want to do that with -- and help our customers scale to
take advantage of that.
Gary, maybe in your role, how has the data science side changed maybe a bit since
you've been at Facebook in terms of bringing those teams around?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Yes, I mean, certainly, I get -- one of the questions I get asked, particularly working at
Facebook, I get asked, particularly because of my age, a lot of parents will ask me if
their kids can get a job at Facebook. And I -- please don't send me any resumes after
this. And a lot of them are -- I will say, we will hire as many data scientists and
analysts as we can. And it is because whether it be on the customer-facing part of the
business or the advertising facing part of the business, as an example, the ability for
us to really get insight in terms of how products -- early products, early features are
getting traction, for example. Peter, to your point just a moment ago, ad products,
how are those being used? What kind of returns are advertisers seeing in those? We
want to be able to make sure we're providing that and getting those insights quickly,
which data science is required.
On the innovation side, though, too, how do you balance maybe the more data-
driven kind of approach with the human-driven in terms of bringing those aspects
together?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

Q - Peter Coleman Stabler{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Yes. Well I think this is a broad skill that I think most marketers need. You do need to
do both. So we have a very clear brand strategy of the things we want to focus on as
a company, the things we want to focus on for our individual brands. And it's part
and parcel that we -- if we have a set of things or initiatives we want to launch, we go
back to that strategy. Then similarly, we -- the bulk of my organization, as an example,
is actually in product marketing. So we're -- our folks are actually embedded with
product managers and engineers working on new features, new apps, et cetera. And
we're working, again, with data to look and understand how are people using the
products, how might that might be diﬀerent around the world, are there insights we
can gather from that to then deploy maybe a broader feature to more people and
more places. So you're really just doing both at once.
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
When you think about your top 3 priorities for this year, could you help us
understand where those lie?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Sure, yes. I mean, I think there's really a few things. One is -- and I know there's been
a lot of analysts interested in this. We launched a product about 8, 10 weeks ago
called Watch. It's early days, very early days for that. But we're looking at how to
develop a system around that -- basically, a user system where people are
developing content, more professional contributors developing content, as are we.
And ﬁgure that out. So that's early, early days. And we're doing a bit of marketing
with that product to, again, look at early adopters, look at merchandising the content
as a way to show the best opportunity for people to engage with that product.
Another one is in the area of integrity. And that's really -- that's a little bit of an inside
baseball term. But it really kind of relates to 3 things: it's ads integrity, news feed
integrity and what we call community integrity. And in each of those areas, we have --
and Mark talked about this in the last earnings call, we're making signiﬁcant
investments to just be better. And there's a lot of work we need to do to be better,
given the range, speed, diversity of content that is on our system. And I'm happy to
go into more detail on that if you'd like. Then the third, which we're very active in
and developing user pathing, talking very broadly with regulators about it, is GDPR,
which goes into Europe in May of next year, because we think that is certainly a
pretty seminal point to really understand the new regulatory regime in Europe. But I
think even more so from a marketing standpoint, we actually do think it's an
opportunity to recommunicate to people exactly how we use data, exactly how they
can understand how to use the product better. And that's what we're planning to do.
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
The transparency piece of the data usage has been a focus of Facebook for a couple
years now. Can you give us any sort of kind of anecdotal insights as to how
consumers are engaging with that? There are actually a lot of tools available to
consumers on the platform. And I would assume that part of your eﬀorts are to keep
the population educated on how they can control their experience.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

Q - Peter Coleman Stabler
A - Gary S. Briggs
Q - Peter Coleman Stabler{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, I think broadly speaking, we all get used to using apps in a certain way.
And once you get used to using an app in a certain way, you end up developing a
little bit of what I call wallpaper syndrome, where other features, other functions in
the app, you may not see that. A classic example is like Word or Excel. And what I've
found is the more we actually help people understand the product, the more
satisﬁed they are with the experience and the more loyal they become. So a speciﬁc
example. A few years back, we had a change in our terms of service and we'd had
previous changes in our terms of service before to keep up with regulation, as an
example. And so when we were changing the, what we call the TOS, terms of service.
And the statement of rights and responsibilities, the SRR, we looked at that and said,
"Okay, much like with what's upcoming in the GDPR, there's an opportunity for us to
communicate better to people about how to use the product." So we created a set
of modules called Privacy Basics. And we also overhauled the privacy and security
center on the site to make it more simple and easier to use. Now again, a lot of this
you can look to where you understand how people are using the product and use
that as a way to inform what you end up communicating. Two things: one is we
looked at the help pages that people were going to, what were the ones that were
the most frequent help pages, how good is that content, how might we take
individual pieces of content and combine them into modules that do a better job
explaining? And another example is when you're in the product and you do
something, we might then communicate back to you, post that action. And
communicate something to you about how to use the product better. For example, if
I am posting a lot about my chocolate labs and your tired of seeing dogs in your
news feed from me, you might unfollow me. And if you unfollow me and your next
user -- next time you come on, you might see a piece of content that on top of feeds
that says, "Hi. you just unfollowed someone. Would you like to know more about
privacy settings?" And in each of these opportunities, much like you would as a
merchant, you're looking for pieces of content. You then show that's the next logical
thing to show someone. And you use that as an opportunity to then, again, enrich
their understanding of how to use the product.
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
Broadly speaking, it speaks to the power of the feedback loop, right? You have a
persistent login. This is something that we talk about and a lot of analysts talk about.
One of the fundamental advantages of Facebook is that you have a persistent login
across your products, whether -- irrespective of whether it's a phone, a tablet, a TV, a
PC, et cetera.
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Type of devices they're on, what feeds they're on, yes.
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
Yes. So you're able to measure in real time the reaction to every change you make. If
you rewind the clock to when you were at Pepsi and compare and contrast what
Pepsi -- what kind of data can they be gathering about how people are using theirFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

Page 6 of 17A - Gary S. Briggs
Q - Kenneth Michael Sena
A - Gary S. Briggsproduct? I mean -- and how much data is sitting on the shelf rather static and unused
in these types of companies?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Well I mean, I have 2 -- I mean, 2 points: one is, look, this is the best marketing job on
the planet because you have the opportunity to know, if I show this part of the room
a set of communication; then I withhold this part of the room from (recused)
communication, I know the impact on not just attitude but behavior. I mean, it's
pretty extraordinary. And if I go back to when I was at Pepsi, we would do really large
sweepstakes. We used to do one called Pepsi Stuﬀ, if folks are old enough to
remember Pepsi Stuﬀ, where you bought enough Pepsi and you got Jeﬀ Gordon's
racing jacket or something like that. And we'd get done with all that and literally just
throw the data away. There was no use for it. And I don't know if it's gotten much
better since. You have to look for every opportunity where people are reaching out
to you and want to communicate with your brand. And your job as a marketer is to
drive the conversations about your brand. So the way -- the best way to do that is to
look for opportunities where people are saying something to you and aggregate
that, because what's happened is consumers now expect the experiences that they
have should be good everywhere. One of the things we see in advertising, as an
example, is one of the pieces of feedback we get about advertising and why we
want advertisers to make advertising better is because when people look at an ad
that's highly relevant to them, it has more usefulness to them. And they're actually
more satisﬁed with the ad. So people expect that much like if you call up a call
center if you're trying to get a ﬂight home and you're calling Delta and you could be
logged into Delta. And then you get to the customer service agent and they don't
have any of the information that you had from when you logged in, you're like, "Why
did you have me log in?" So everybody's expectations now is the highest and best.
And I think what oﬄine companies need to do is move more towards digital
capability. And I'm not necessarily saying it has to be digital advertising in and of
itself. But they have to be capable in a way that engages with conversations with
people to their expectations.
And Gary, are there examples where Facebook really goes -- wants to go oﬀ
Facebook in terms of some of the marketing eﬀorts, whether by category, geography
or other?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Sure. We've done that a few times. We went oﬀ, what we call, oﬀ-platform. So that is -
- one of the largest advertisers on Facebook, by the way, is Facebook. So we're -- we
use a lot of ad sets. But we have gone oﬀ-platform. And in particular, when we
launched Live, we did that in a number of markets, particularly the U.S. and the U.K.
And again, the reason, much like we do at times -- I mean, we were simply trying to
make sure that people understood the product as quickly as possible and also look
at new -- a new usage occasion maybe that people might otherwise see in the
product. Similarly, we've been running a campaign for the last 10 months in
Germany. Germany is not as highly penetrated as a market as we like it to be. A lot of
it has to do with cultural norms, which are totally understandable and respectful. ButFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

A - Gary S. Briggsagain, we found one of the things we could do is we went out and interviewed
Germans ﬁrst-person, had them -- the way the ads work, if you haven't seen them, is
a German complains about Facebook. Then we actually come back with the answer
that's in the product of what they're complaining about. And we found it to be very
eﬀective as a way to overcome the urban legends, if you will, of what Facebook
supposedly is. And it's actually worked very well to drive engagement and overall
metrics for us in Germany.
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
You made a point last night that the majority of the world experiences Facebook on
a 2G network on an Android device. So as you think about the geographic breadth
of Facebook and the breadth of products you oﬀer, I mean, how challenging is it for
you to be culturally sensitive, to be technologically relevant across, I would guess,
150 countries or more? Everywhere ex China, I guess.
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Yes. And North Korea, I think, as far as that.
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
Oh, you guys aren't there yet?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
I don't know if anybody is. One guy is there. We know that one guy is there.
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
How big a challenge is that for you?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Well I think the organization is rather global in and of itself, although I think one of
the things we're trying to do as a company is become more and more so. But we do
a lot to recognize the very fact that you mentioned, Peter, which is most people are
not on an iPhone on a 4G waiting for a 5G network. So we look at app load time. We
look at the actual weight of the app itself in terms of as people look to use the apps.
And try to be building products that recognize, as you mentioned much earlier,
what's the device they're coming in, what's the speed they're coming in at and how
far are they along in the curve in terms of usage of the product. Facebook Lite is a
product, as an example, that's been very helpful to us in those environments where
people don't have a 3G, 4G network, because you can't -- particularly, you can't see
video and you probably can't see photos in that environment. I think culturally, one
of the things that's an interesting example is today is Tuesday, we have on
Messenger inside the company a thing called 2G Tuesdays, where we slow down
everybody's service in the company and we operate -- you operate on -- your
Messenger actually operates on a 2G speed, just to remind everybody that most of
the world does not have what we have, as a way to just drive recognition and
understanding across employees.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

Interesting.
And on the point about moving into new markets and maybe driving some
engagement, are there data sets that Facebook can beneﬁt from that Facebook
doesn't already have?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Are there (inaudible)?
Data sets like third-party or...
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
I mean, I can't speak to that speciﬁcally. I -- we certainly work a lot with data partners.
We ﬁnd that, broadly speaking, the more that we are able to be very kind of upfront
about the data we're collecting and using, not only from a regulatory standpoint. But
from a user understanding standpoint, the better we are. Because I think people,
particularly younger consumers, get a pretty good understanding of the bargain and
kind of the trade-oﬀ that they're having in terms of using these apps. So I can't think
of anything in particular where -- we have good partnerships with companies like
Nielsen, as an example. And lots of them around the world. But nothing in particular
I can think of.
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
When you think about the scale of Facebook from an advertising perspective, one
statistic that continues to stun me every time I hear it is that you have 6 million
advertisers globally, right? So that means that you're designing ad products for the
local wedding photographer all the way up to PepsiCo and General Motors. How
can what you're doing help the ad product development team kind of get a view
into how to solve some of those problems for small marketers? And would you
agree that that's a number that could potentially expand greatly?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Well I mean, I think you have to look at how many people actually have a page on
Facebook. I think it's about a little more than 10x of the number of advertisers, active
advertisers we have. So page owners clearly have put content into the system. They
are indicating that they want to do business on Facebook. And we ﬁnd that's a great
on-ramp. Then certainly, one of the things we're trying to do broadly is simplify the
ads products as a way to allow more customers to get on, understand exactly the
kind of product they should use, making sure that through the -- if you actually go
and you go to -- I don't know how many folks here have actually tried to advertise
something through the Facebook platform. But we try to be very good at like what's
your goal, what are you trying to achieve. We try to make sure that -- we tell peopleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

Q - Peter Coleman Stablerdon't try to spend a lot right out of the gate, test and learn as fast as possible. We try
to make those tools very easy to use. Then also, we put a lot into, the last two years in
particular, into Facebook analytics as a way to create much more of a device-
agnostic view into your -- the results that you see. So we love the fact that more and
more small businesses are creating their capability on Facebook. Really -- frankly,
we're really very proud of that. And the more -- that you're going to see us put more
and more eﬀort into generating kind of small business communities around the
world, because we think that's a great testament to the power of the platform.
Maybe can you expand on that a little bit in terms of maybe managing trust as a way
of bringing that business in? Or even in the context of the recent election
involvement by Russia, et cetera, like how do you, broadly speaking, manage trust in
the platform?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Sure, I mean, look, I -- you said Russia, is that what you said?
Including, just managing trust overall across.
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Yes, I think Mark certainly talked about this in the last earnings call. We should have
been better, need to be better and are going to invest a lot to be better. And as part
of that, one of the things that we are doing is to really focus more on -- at a set of
areas, ads integrity and overall news feed integrity, which I mentioned, really
reinforcing the core purpose of why people come to Facebook in the ﬁrst place,
which is really to get -- develop a better understanding of friends, family and the
world around them, much more invested into communities. So that's kind of our
internal word for how we think about Groups, where we do ﬁnd the more that
people become engaged with Facebook Groups, the more value they ﬁnd in the
platform and the real kind of amazing stories that come out of use of the platform.
Then ﬁnally, in terms of small business and kind of -- small businesses and job
creation. The ability for small businesses to be at equal footing with larger ones is
one of the really amazing parts of major digital platforms. It is back to the earlier
question you had, Peter, of why is this disruption happening in the ﬁrst place.
Gerstner used to say, when I was at IBM, "I've never met a small business that wants
to stay a small business." And so the more that you can actually have these tools and
whether it's in your neighborhood regionally or being able to be in one place and
ship globally, that's what these platforms are able to do. And we're going to invest
much more there.
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
So you mentioned Groups. And to me, Groups is one of the kind of overlooked
pieces of Facebook. And another area that I think doesn't necessarily get as much
attention as it should is Marketplace. Marketplace has been around for a while. ItFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

Page 10 of 17A - Gary S. Briggs
Q - Kenneth Michael Sena

Q - Peter Coleman Stablerdoesn't feel like there's been an aggressive push behind Marketplace. How should
we be thinking or how is your team thinking about the role of Marketplace to play?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Marketplace is a great example of where we saw people using our product in
another part of the world that we didn't expect and then behind that, ended up
building a product about it. Particularly in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, we
saw group activities. So back to the point of Groups, Peter, group activity where
people were buying and selling within Groups. So we created a product around that.
And as we've done that, we've expanded to more and more geographies. The point
in fact, though, is, certainly for me and the role I have in terms of the brand, buying
and selling is a diﬀerent experience than us creating just information in and of itself.
And we want to make sure that the experience that people have is a good one, that
has trust to it and safety. So we have been -- that requires a lot of scale. And the tools
to that, working the cues of that, to make sure that people ﬂag a product or ﬂag
somebody who is selling something or buying something for that matter, that we
have security operations in place to make sure that's going to scale well. So that has
been the rate-limiting step, to a large degree.
Got it. And maybe can you talk a little bit more speciﬁcally about how closely -- sorry,
maybe a little bit more speciﬁcally about how closely your team works with product
development and maybe the other marketing teams as well within Facebook?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Yes. So our team is comprised of 3 or 4 sets of folks. We've got research and
analytics folks. So qual and quant folks. We've got creative and media folks and then
we have product marketing. And the majority of our team is actually product
marketing. So in that case, they are actually embedded with the product managers
and the engineers. So I made a reference earlier about ask a CMO who sits around
them. In my case, actually, the product marketers by and large don't sit around me
because they're sitting around the product managers and engineers in whatever
building there. It could be the folks who are working on Messenger or proﬁle or
Search and News Feed, certainly. Then just to be, clarify a little bit earlier, my team's
responsibility, we don't have responsibility for the B2B part of Facebook. That runs
through the sales team. So there is a product marketing organization that's
embedded with the ads engineers and sales engineers and that team works similarly
-- very similar to ours and in partnership with us. But in each case, we're working very
early on to do consumer or advertiser research, to some of your questions about
what are the best feature sets. If we do see something that is occurring in one part of
the world that we can translate to another part of the world, how might we do that. If
we are dealing with a crisis like recently we were in the U.S. around the Russian
investigation, what are people saying outside the media, what are people actually
reacting to and how should we react to that? All that is really part of our team. But
that's essentially how we're broken up and distributed.

A - Gary S. BriggsI want to move back to video for a second. So there's a lot of debate in the investor
community around television. And the viability of television, linear TV going forward,
the eﬀectiveness of the 30-second TV commercial. I mean, 20 years ago, there were
industry experts calling for the death of the 30-second television commercial. It does
feel like that the digital platforms out there today, whether it's the digital capabilities
of Facebook's advertising or the digital -- the video capabilities of a YouTube, are
pointing to a needed change in the strategy of television advertisers. When I think
about the traditional arc of a 30-second TV commercial, a Pepsi commercial maybe,
storytell, storytell, storytell, arc.

Dogs, puppies. And what else did we do?
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
Logo card for 1/3 of a second at the end. And the digital paradigm doesn't feel
matched to that. So -- and I know Facebook has been on a signiﬁcant education
campaign to try to help marketers understand how to do it best. You are maybe the
largest advertiser on Facebook. What are your observations from back in the day
when you were creating big expensive TV commercials for eBay and Pepsi, versus
what works best for you from a video perspective on Facebook today?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Sure. I think one of the most instructive sets of people to watch on digital, including
Facebook, are the comedians. So most people are like, they think of examples. And
they'll think about another company and things like that. Watch what the comedians
do, because I'll tell you, they are the ﬁrst people to use subtitles, they are the ﬁrst
people to rearrange the joke structure to make it work for immediate attention span.
And the reason is their content is like products. I mean, it goes stale very, very fast.
So look at Colbert and Fallon and -- I have to be careful which comedians I mention
lately because some of them are in trouble -- but if you look at the comedians and
how they structure their content, I think that's really, really interesting to look at. For
us, in terms of what we do on the platform, there's really 2 parts to that. One is we do
structure the content diﬀerently. So you hit it exactly right. Pepsi's structure if it was a
30 or 60, it was like bump, bump, bump, joke. Really, you can look at the storyboards
and that is how it's pretty much built. Now we actually re-changed the narrative
structure in a way to deliver something really upfront that is going to gather
someone's attention and then deliver something later on. In the structure of what's in
a News Feed ad, there's a couple of things, one of which I think is often overlooked,
which is you don't have to just watch the video to get the impression, you are seeing
a newspaper ad, if you will, that's got your name on it, it's got a subtitle, then it's got
a freeze frame for whatever you decide to freeze frame for your video. There is anFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

are going to watch. And I think on that point, I think advertisers have to get
comfortable with the fact that it's not about what you supply, it's about what the
consumer is going to demand. And you have to kind of think about, are you
respectful to that? Are you actually building content in that regard? The last, last
thing I'll say on the question is I do think TV absolutely has a role, live TV, particularly
appointment television, still has a role. We see that in terms of when we bought
media in other markets. One piece of insight from when I was at Google and I
worked on the Chrome campaign years back, when we were trying to go broadly
with Chrome, we found that buying 30-second ads actually, interestingly, didn't work
very well, we actually have to go to 60 and 90, because you couldn't get people's
attention. Now, actually, I think we're in a very -- kind of immediately in a diﬀerent era
in the U.S. where I could tell you it is really hard to get consumers' attention through
television right now because they are so distracted. Like buying television in the U.S.
is just a hard thing, because consumers just are dealing with other stuﬀ. And that is a
euphemistic reference to politics. But it absolutely is going on culturally.
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
Well I think that you've stated that as time spent on Facebook has increased, it's kind
of naÃ¯ve to think that there isn't a lot of multitasking going on. And what was the
stat you said, that some of the peak usage on Facebook was during the commercial
breaks of...

The Super Bowl.

Q - Peter Coleman StablerAnything you could say maybe more on the mix between kind of user-generated or
premium within the context of video and whether or not that sort of shortening
attention span or distractedness that you mentioned, if that kind of limits some of the
areas? Or how you maybe just see those overall -- over time evolving?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Speciﬁcally, as it relates to -- I don't think we know. That is how I, I'd answer that
question. I think that is evolving very quickly and the best that we can do right now is
experiment quickly, which is what we are trying to do. Yes, I think -- I've seen,
certainly, in my last kind of 15, 16 years in digital, trying to predict what a consumer is
going to do is not easy and probably dumb. So the best thing is to observe quickly
what people are doing and then be able to build a system to respond fast. Am I
talking too quickly?

So when we think about, going back to Watch and we know it's very early, what are
the things that consumers should be looking for? Like how are you going out to
consumers and educating them about this new feature? I mean, some survey work
we did around Facebook Video earlier this year suggested that even hard-core users
of the blue app still might not really be aware of all the features that are embedded
there. Sorry about that, what I hit.

Is someone trying to spin a record or something? What are doing back there?

blue app for a while now, that there were still a lot of people who had tunnel vision
in how they were using the product.
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
So this is kind of classic online marketing, which is cross-merchandising. So we'll look
at doing ads in News Feed, we will look at -- one of the things that we've done very
well, I think, is we have a module on the site which is called People You May Know.
So PYMK is what we call it, where we will try to have, if you know friends of yours,
potential friends of yours that are on the platform, that you might want to become
oﬃcially friends with them. We've done that with other content and we'll continue to
do that. That's a way to cross-merchandise, as an example. So we're experimenting
with on-platform ads, to some degree, oﬀ-platform digital ads, with getting people
to understand about Live. Live, I mentioned earlier, we went actually into traditional
media, if you will, to communicate about Live. I don't expect we are going to do that
with Watch. But what we're trying to do with Watch is through cross-merchandising
on the platform and a degree of digital marketing, is have people see content they
might be interested in and then use the tactics we have very well, is to get people
who might engage with a piece of content before, to come back again. Speciﬁc in
that example is one of the great tools we use on Facebook, which advertisers use,
too, is we can show you a video ad. And based upon your engagement with that
video ad, we then can show you a carousel unit. And through a carousel unit, we can
give you the 1, 2, 3, if you will, of how to get re-engaged or other kinds of contents
that they may want to see. We use that all the time.
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
Perfect segue, wouldn't be a marketing discussion if we didn't talk about the funnel,
right?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
I have no idea what you're talking about.
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
It sounds like -- you have no idea about -- the author of the funnel. People often look
at Google and say, wow, they occupy the bottom of the funnel position in terms of
directing sales. And Facebook might not have people come to the Facebook
platform looking to directly engage in commerce. But help us understand how the
tools you have available can it aﬀect, yield a much greater breadth of funnel for
Facebook than most people and most investors might realize?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
I mean, certainly, you're seeing advertisers do that, Amazon does that quite well.
Zappos, a part of Amazon, obviously does that; Lyft does that quite well. They are
using dynamic product ads as a way to get pieces of content in front of people that
is far down the funnel. And I think, not to play too much with the funnel example. But
the general nature of Google's funnel is slightly diﬀerent than our funnel. I mean,
ours is a little bit broader at the top, a little bit narrower at the bottom. But bothFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

Q - Kenneth Michael Senacompanies are trying to develop products, particularly for advertisers, as they move
more and more towards digital, that represents all those opportunities. But we have
absolutely seen, more sophisticated, if you will, digital marketers use the more
bottom of funnel tools and scale very well with it.
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
And if we think about one of your largest advertising categories is consumer
packaged goods. They don't typically have e-commerce, they've had traditionally
very blunt tools to measure changes in awareness, yet they have found an equation
on Facebook in terms of linking exposure to actual sales, right? And so much like
you're able to monitor the ability of your teams to drive particular engagement in a
new feature on Facebook, these marketers are linking into actual scanner data at a
supermarket level, right? So I mean, are we early in the game here? Are there other
categories. And I think about auto, I think about travel, I think about ﬁnancial
services, where it is kind of tough, frankly, to measure the eﬀectiveness sometimes.
Are we just at the very beginning of kind of a measurement revolution?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Well I think in general, one of the things I made a reference earlier about young
people are looking for roles at Facebook and places like us, I think in general, it's
early. So that's a broader cultural point. But we absolutely have examples of
advertisers now who are, you might consider more traditional, who are using these
tools really well. One of my favorite examples is one, Canadian Tire, which I -- if you
haven't spent time in Canada or don't know of Canadian Tire, you should get to
know Canadian Tire. They sell a lot more than tires. Canadian Tire is a really
wonderful example where they have, by and large, stopped running newspaper
inserts. And the reason they've done that is they have found that the ability for them
to run dynamic product ads has allowed them to pull through a lot more products
than they have saw typically in ROP. And with run of press ads, I mean, I know that's a
very -- it gets to the point of the friction in the system for companies to spend as they
spent last quarter. I mean, again, I worked with Pepsi for a while. When you got to go
stand in front of the bottlers and say, "Hi. I want to completely overhaul how we are
going to do our marketing and you should just trust me on that." You bet they are
sitting there in the audience and saying, "Hi." -- whatever they're going to call you,
Piker from purchase -- "I can't wait to see the next guy show up here next quarter." I
mean, that's basically how they think. So it is very hard to redirect that money. But I
will tell you, if you talk to folks at Canadian Tire, they will say they have found they
had to rearrange their supply chain in order to make sure they're able to deliver on
the amount of product they were pulling through. And that's a big deal. I mean,
companies overhauling their supply chain software is a big deal. But that is where
this is headed and I think that is why it's early.
Mark talks a lot about the goal of connecting the world and universal human needs
to be connected. So as you move out into newer geographies, can you just speak to
some of the speciﬁc challenges and maybe the sensitivity that you experience in
your role?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

Well I mean, absolutely there are diﬀerent regulatory regimes, if you will. And
diﬀerent cultural norms in terms of content. So we absolutely have to respect that.
And we actually spend a lot of time looking at those questions. There are broader
questions that led to the brand of a set of expectations that someone might have in
one market and how that might translate to another. Absolutely, countries watch one
another. And to the degree that it's that, whether at everything from domiciling data
to terms of service or content policies in various markets, we are constantly looking
at that around the world to make sure, not only that we're following the rule of law.
But making sure we are able to build that into our processes. But again, I think, at
least from my role, one of the things we try to do is then communicate back to
people, the people who are users, what are we doing and why. So that it's not a
mystery. And I have found, even with the case of the current U.S. -- not as current,
frankly, right now, example of Russia and the U.S., there is absolutely an initial
reaction that consumers have to what's going on. But ultimately, people get back to,
hey, here's why I use the product, here's what I get out of it. I ﬁnd value in terms of
friends and family and the world around me. And we try to steer people back
towards reaﬃrming, really, the core purpose of the product.
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
I guess, one last one from me. There's some other large platforms out there, couple,
most of them are owned by Facebook. But anything out there that inspires you,
marketing strategies you've seen out there?
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Marketing strategies seen out there. I think what Airbnb did with their brand
positioning has been quite well done. I know Jonathan a little bit who just -- is in the
process of leaving there. If you look and set the clock back 3, four years ago, Uber as
an example and Airbnb, both of those companies are being somewhat disruptive of
local economies and broader economies. But I think Airbnb has put themselves in a
position where they are much more of a respected brand. And I think also we ﬁnd, as
far as, again back to the point of brand positioning as well as execution, they are
getting better and better and becoming more of a world-class customer of ours in
terms of how they use the platform.
{BIO 16258799 <GO>}
Behavior matters.
{BIO 6394054 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, look, I mean, I think it's actually awesome that you can't hide anything, I
do. I think one of the early actions for me as a marketer is the more a consumer gets
to understand your business and brand, the more that transparency should be a
good thing. I worked very, very early when I was at Pepsi and one of the products I
launched was Aquaﬁna. That was a product that, in that case, we were taking water
that was in our plant, running it through reverse osmosis and then selling it. We
