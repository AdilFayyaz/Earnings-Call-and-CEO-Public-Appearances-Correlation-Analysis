{BIO 3131258 <GO>}
Hello. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. My name is Bob Drbul and I am from
Nomura Securities. It gives me great pleasure today to be here with lululemon. I
think we were talking about some of my opening comments it's been a very
interesting year and what a diﬀerence a year makes especially for lululemon.
What we like about lulu, essentially, is the loyalty among the consumer, the unit story,
the unit growth opportunity that is global, the story that's there and as the
management team has transitioned it's always a good sign when you transition a
management team from outgoing CFO to a new CFO that we think is also very
talented. We've got Laurent Potdevin is the CEO, he'll be speaking; John Currie, the
CFO, will also be speaking, and Chris Tham, is in the front row here as well, and Joey
Teklits (1:06), Director of Investor Relations, is also here with us today.
So with that I'd like to turn the microphone over to Laurent.
{BIO 18481730 <GO>}
Good afternoon. I think this mic is on actually. All right. It's a big crowd for being the
end of the day. I mean I don't know if it's as grueling for you guys as it's been for us,
but the timing of these meetings back to back was intense.
Anyway, John and I are very pleased to be here today to give you an update on the
business. So I'll do a brief presentation, John will go a little bit further into the press
release that we issued this morning, and then we'll go into a function show, and I'm
assuming that's what you guys are all here for. And you'll get a glimpse of our spring
2015 products for both men's and women's.
So don't forget to click – so this is what I was told not to screw up. So before we
begin, this is just a reminder that this presentation will include forward-lookingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-01-12

more details in our SEC ﬁlings. I'm assuming you're done reading all of that.
So, quick overview. I mean I couldn't be happier and more proud of the performance
that the team delivered during the holiday season. We continued to build on the
momentum that we saw in Q3, clearly hit an inﬂection point late in Q2, early in Q3,
and we've continued to build on that momentum during the holiday with higher
traﬃc, sequentially improving comps, and just a great holiday season with less
markdowns than last year.
And what I'd like to do is share a quick personal story that really in my mind – in my
mind really sort of helped me visualize the lululemon opportunity. So on December
26, I was in Los Angeles where my kids live with their mother and my parents had
ﬂown from Europe. My daughter was going to a volleyball tournament and needed
an outﬁt, so we decided to go the El Segundo store, which is the closest to their
home. And away from the madness of Boxing Day in Canada, at 10:30 in the
morning I was really hoping that I'd get to interact with the educators in a fairly quiet
environment.
And I walked into a jam-packed store. The music was blasting. People were lining at
the cash register, people were lining at the changing room, like arms, like loaded
with products, and the energy was incredible. I mean guests were engaging with
educators, guests were engaging with each other, and we called our educators to
educate us for a reason for a long time, and for some reason we continued to call
our stores, but that environment was so much more than a store. I mean it was a
community hub. And the energy that you experienced in that location was just
incredible. And that's how I feel and see the lululemon opportunity. I mean it's a
market that we created. We've got amazing products. We're leading the market with
very strong margin and we deliver guest experience that are unique and second to
none. So when I think about the global opportunity, I really think the El Segundo
store and I take that around the world, both in-stores and online across gender, both
men's and women's around the globe and in the future across a number of new
categories.
So a lot of people have said, well what a year – what a diﬀerence a year makes. And I
wasn't around last year and I certainly took my share of fumbling early on. So, but
when I think about this past year and despite all the headwinds that you guys are
very well aware of, I think the team delivered tremendous performance. Like nine
months ago we had set out – I got to move my slides, right – so nine months ago we
had set out to achieve three goals. One was to strengthen the foundation of the
business, so that we could scale the business around the globe and start growing
across multiple categories; it was to reignite our product engine, and it was to
accelerate our global expansion.
We've clearly strengthened our business foundation. Our product ﬂow, our
predictability has greatly improved, our quality at the store level is impeccable, and
our guest experience continue to be so incredibly unique. And we're very much on
track to ﬁnish that foundational work by the end of 2015 and see the full impact ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-01-12
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 3 of 7our work with Q1 of 2016 when our designers, developers, and R&D will have had a
chance to work through the entire go-to-market calendar and see their product
come to life.
From the standpoint of reigniting our product engine, Tara and Jennifer have done
an outstanding job in a very short period of time re-assorting, reﬂowing the
assortment, shifting the balance of product and really shaping the product where we
had opportunities with our fast growing (6:45) group. And what we saw in Q4 was
tremendous performance of our bottoms. It's clearly an indication that we've turned
the corner in reigniting our product engine.
And ﬁnally, when you think about accelerating our global expansion, we've opened
a store in London. We've just opened a store in Singapore. We're about to open our
second store in London in Chelsea next week or the following, and we've identiﬁed a
number of showroom locations. So we're going to be staying very true to our go-to-
market strategy, which is about building showrooms, getting involved in the
communities, gaining momentum with ambassadors, and we're going to do that
over a shorter period of time, so that we can accelerate our international growth. So
we had three pretty signiﬁcant goals to achieve over the past year and the team
delivered outstanding performance.
So, moving forward, I mean, we're going to continue to build on our current
momentum, and 2015 – I think John described 2015 really well on our Q3 call when
he called it an overlap year. I mean some of the investments that we've made, in
terms of building the foundation, are going to sort of normalize and phase out. I
mean we still have a couple of large projects, including merchandising, planning,
and allocation, and then we're going to ramp up some investments around product
innovation in raw materials, in silhouettes, and in categories, as well as investments in
the area of being very guest-centric both in-store and digitally. So you can expect to
see operating margin leveraging in 2016.
So when you think about the key success factors of lululemon, it's always been about
products, brand and community and guest experience. And what you saw in Q4 with
better product ﬂow, better predictability, is that you saw the ability to see these three
circles come together. And for the ﬁrst time, and this is tremendous – this is a
tremendous unlock in terms of the potential of the brand. I mean these three areas
are starting to work really closely together.
So being able to predict the product coming into the store has allowed us to do
much better product modiﬁcations for our guest. It has allowed us to build
campaigns that will deliver seamlessly across digital and in-stores, and it's allowed us
to much better educate our educators in store so that they could, in turn, educate
our guests.
So we've got three fantastic leaders in those three areas, with Delaney leading store
experience, with Duke Stump that recently joined us to lead Brand and Community,
and with Tara leading the product group. And we're really at a time now where weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-01-12
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 4 of 7can switch from playing defense to playing oﬀense. And so I'm really looking forward
to those three leaders coming together and unlocking so much of the potential that
we've got ahead of us. And clearly as we start playing oﬀense, innovation is going to
be fueling all three elements of that business.
So product, well we're leading through design of innovative product. I mean in the
whitespace – some of you saw our whitespace area last year. I mean these guys have
done tremendous work. That combined with the talent that we hired on the design
side is really giving us the tools to continue to lead in a way that's unprecedented
and really sort of focus on innovation from a raw material standpoint, from a
silhouette standpoint across men's and women's and down the road across multiple
categories. And we're at a time now where with better product ﬂow and with better
predictability we can really start working with our vendors. We can move away from
working on the tactics of supply chain to really sort of looking down the future and
working on innovation with them, so very clearly a year of stabilizing the business,
creating momentum from a product standpoint, and now moving full steam ahead.
Guest experience, clearly something that we've always done really well and our
focus is going to be in a couple of areas. One, from a digital standpoint, we've got a
tremendous opportunity to create more intimate, more personalized relationship
with our guests. And so we're implementing CRM. We're doing a full global redesign
of our website. But think about – given that we touch every guest experience, I mean
think about – and I use that example because she's a friend of mine. I mean she's a
consultant. She lives in Park City. She does most of her buying online. When she
goes to the store, at this point in time our new store in Park City, we don't know who
she is. And so think about an environment where she goes to the store, we know
exactly who she is, we know what kind of activities she gets involved to, and when
she goes on vacation to Hawaii, when she lands, we actually can connect her with
one of our ambassadors and give to elective class next to her hotel. So the ability to
really leverage technology, CRM and from a product standpoint, our RFID project is
really going to allow us to create much more intimate, and continue to build on what
is already a very good, and a very unique and powerful guest experience.
And then from a store standpoint, I mean, we're not over saturated, we've got a very
strong footprint. And we're starting to play with diﬀerent formats. So the economics
always have to work ﬁrst, but you're starting to see us play with diﬀerent formats. So
in Soho we opened a men's only store. We're opening larger footprint in Flatiron,
New York or in Robson, Vancouver or in Miami, recently. And so we're sort of playing
with diﬀerent format and trying to leverage the men's opportunity. And when it
comes to men's, we're trying the men's only store, but we'll also – I really like the
idea of the side-by-side because she still shops for him a lot. So a real focus on guest
experience.
And ﬁnally, from a brand and community standpoint, I mean it's really sort of
deepening our voice, I mean, taking all the work that we do so well at the grass root
level and sort of giving it, amplifying that voice, so there is that global resonance.
And I'm really, personally, very passionate about the balance of doing good and
doing well. So in the near future you can expect a little bit more focus on increasingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-01-12
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 5 of 7John E. Currieour focus in that sense and really sort of having a mission that makes us a little bit
more inclusive. And that's going to resonate with our guests very, very strongly.
So with that said, 2014 was a year of stabilizing the business. The whole team did a
great job battling all sorts of headwinds. The ﬁrst six months were certainly
interesting and not what I had, necessarily, anticipated, but our work is paying oﬀ.
The second half of the year has been tremendous. We're going to continue to build
on the momentum that we've created. And I'm really, really excited about 2015.
So before I turn it to John, I really want to thank him for his guidance, his advice. I
mean, this past year would have been many times more diﬃcult for me if I didn't
have him by my side. And while we're sorry to see him go, we know that he's going
to have a ton of fun skiing. So, and Stuart, who most of you – a lot of you guys know
is a fantastic hire that we conducted the search together, so very, very excited for
John and for Stuart. And obviously John's leaving us in a very strong position with a
very, very strong ﬁnancial team with Chris, Jodi and Vincent (11:19). So with that, I'll let
John dive a little bit deeper into our numbers.
{BIO 1494810 <GO>}
Thank you. Well, both Bob and Laurent said it, but I just have to say it as well. What a
diﬀerence a year makes. This year I'm here with a CEO. That's an improvement. And
I'm not standing up here explaining reduced guidance. I have the pleasure of
summarizing the increased guidance that we're able to announce this morning. We
really had a tremendous holiday season. We came in with some headwinds in terms
of store openings and currency and port disruptions. But we mitigated those to
some extent. And strong product assortment, continuation of strong traﬃc trends
that we started seeing in Q3 really allowed us to deliver better than our expectations
for Q4. And the strength was across the board. It was both in women's and in men's
and it was both in-stores and on e-commerce.
So just brieﬂy, as we announced this morning, we increased our revenue guidance,
for the quarter, to $595 million to $600 million, so the top end of that range is
increased by $15 million. And we, of course, narrowed the range because we're
closer to the end of the quarter. That translates to a combined comp for the quarter
of 6% to 7%, up from previous low-single digits. And with the leverage and the
higher volume there's strong ﬂow through to EPS, and our guidance is now $0.71 to
$0.73, an increase from the previous $0.65 to $0.69. For the year that takes us to just
under $1.8 billion with a positive 3% combined comp, and normalized EPS in the
range of $1.80 to $1.82. So we feel great about a strong ﬁnish to 2014 and we feel that
momentum carrying into 2015.
2015, I don't know how many times I've said today that I'm not giving guidance on
2015 yet. But let me just talk a little bit about some of the factors impacting the P&L
and the margin proﬁle. Let me start by talking about currency because with lower oil
prices, Canada being a petro dollar, there's been quite a signiﬁcant change, a
reduction in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar over the past two months toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-01-12
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 6 of 7three months, even since we last gave guidance. In the past when most of our
revenue was in Canada, a drop in the Canadian dollar was quite catastrophic.
And the point is really that that's not the case anymore. When the Canadian dollar is
lower, of course, it reduces our reported revenue in U.S. dollars and it also
compresses our gross margins because we buy product in U.S. dollars even when it's
sold in Canada. But because our head oﬃce is in Vancouver in Canada, the SG&A
that's also in Canadian dollars oﬀsets the negatives in the revenue and the gross
margin line, and in fact we have quite a nice natural hedge at this point. If anything, a
lower Canadian dollar slightly beneﬁts us. So, again, four years or ﬁve years ago, that
was a much diﬀerent conversation, and I think it's important to point out that shift.
Other factors, I mean, as we head into 2015, in addition to the momentum we felt in
Q4 in terms of traﬃc, the stronger product assortment that's going to help drive top
line in 2015, we have lots of growth drivers ahead of us still. We're going to end the
year at 200 stores in the U.S., which is two-thirds of the way to our target of 300
stores, and we have a robust pipeline for 2015 and beyond to complete that build-
out, in addition to continuing to increase our penetration on our e-commerce
channel.
ivivva, our second concept, which will end the year with 22 stores, has really hit its
stride. It's doing 1,000 a square foot, and so it's time to put our foot to the gas a little
bit. So we're looking to add up to 20 stores for ivivva next year.
In terms of margins, we talked a lot, for the last year, about all the work that Tara and
Jennifer are doing to shore up the supply chain, all the investments in systems, in
people and talent, and process change. And those are well underway and on track.
But as we've said before, most of the beneﬁt of that you'll see in 2016. In 2015 there
will be some beneﬁt on the margin. We've certainly stabilized our merchandise
margins; we'll see some improvement in airfreight, but for the most part, the beneﬁts
from that you'll see next year.
As Laurent mentioned, 2015 is sort of an overlap year in terms of investment on the
supply chain. It was a heavy year in 2014, a lot of systems and other initiatives that
we're putting the ﬁnishing touches on in 2015, and we're shifting our focus to more
forward-looking playing oﬀense investments, including our R&D, our whitespace
facility, and an increased focus on innovation in our product.
In addition to investments on the supply chain, again we're looking to play oﬀense in
terms of other areas of investment, include technology, guest experience,
innovation, and the brand. So all of this is a way of saying, 2015, we feel like we're
entering 2015 in a strong position. The question is not are we going to show
leverage in 2015, the question is really as we shift to playing oﬀense, what are the
right investments that are enough to be really driving the longer term growth of the
business without taking on too much beyond what we can execute well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-01-12
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 7 of 7So, again, we're still working on the ﬁnal touches of our 2015 budget with our board,
but again, the number one question isn't are we showing leverage? It's really are we
doing the right things to support the long-term growth of the brand, because that's
really what's important in the long run.
So that's the end of the prepared remarks ahead of the function show. So for the
audience listening to this on webcast, this concludes the formal part of the
presentation and thank you for joining us today. We'll turn oﬀ the audio, visual, and
the webcast.
