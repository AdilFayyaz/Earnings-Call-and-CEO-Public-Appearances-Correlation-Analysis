Presentation
Good morning, everybody, we are very pleased to move on to the next presentation.
Very happy to introduce Amazon, who has been very gracious to oﬀer up their CFO,
Tom Szkutak.
In terms of format, Tom will be walking through a couple of slides after which we will
do a general Q&A discussion that I will kick oﬀ and then we will open up to the
audience for questions after that. Tom, let me turn it over to you.
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. Good morning, everybody.
These slides that I have may include some forward-looking statements. So for a full
list of our risks and uncertainties please see our most recent 10-K and 10-Q and
subsequent disclosures.
Just quickly, I am going to walk through our results and our strategy. First of all, our
results, our focus.
Our focus is on maximizing free cash ﬂow and free cash ﬂow per share. We maximize
proﬁt dollars, not margins. And we are focused on growing our free cash ﬂow and
having high returns on investment capital.
Here is a look at our free cash ﬂow over the past several years that you can see. Most
recently, we had $1.4 billion of free cash ﬂow, up 82% year-over-year. That is on a
trailing 12 month basis ending Q1.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2009-06-10

Page 2 of 15Here is how you look at some of the pieces. As you can see, we are getting good
leverage in working capital. Also good leverage in earnings as well as CapEx versus
depreciation.
Here is a look at our operating cycle. As you can see from this slide, we have a
negative operating cycle. What that means is as you can see from looking at the
page, we have approximately 29 days worth of inventory on hand; a few days' worth
of receivables and we pay our suppliers on average of 57 days.
And so that means that we have a negative operating cycle of 23 days. So as we
grow working capital as a source of cash.
Share count, we are eﬃciently managing dilution. You can see the trend over the
past several years. If you take stock-based awards outstanding plus common shares
outstanding, you can see we have 447 million shares up from 435 million year-over-
year. And you see the trend going back to 2004.
Sales over the past 12 months, $19.9 billion of revenue up 25% year over year, 27%
excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates.
Here is how we look at sales. We break out into two segments, North American
International; and then we break out the segments into media, electronics and other
general merchandise and other. Other includes Amazon enterprise solutions, Web
services, cobranded credit card and a number of a few other things that go in there
as well.
Here's how you look at -- we look at our segments on a global basis. You can see that
back in ﬁve years ago we had approximately $5.7 billion of revenue. That grew to
$19.9 billion. You can see the split so even though the media has -- from a percentage
standpoint has dropped to 56%, it still grew nicely through the period. And EGM
and others become more meaningful over the past ﬁve years.
The same is true for the split between North America and internationally. But
certainly international was more predominantly a media category business like yours
and you can see the growth that we've seen on both sides of this international both
and I say both media and EGM.
International sales, if you look at over the past 12 months, I see it is up 26% or 30%
excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate. Obviously includes UK, Germany,
France, Japan and China.
We also shipped from all of our geographies to over 200 countries from an export
standpoint. We have also had solid operating performance from international as
well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2009-06-10

Page 3 of 15Gross proﬁt. The bar charts at gross proﬁt dollars, the line's gross margin. You can
see that our gross proﬁt dollars on a trailing 12-month basis is up 24% year-over-year.
The consolidated segment operating income, up 25% year-over-year to just over $1.1
billion. Again, our goal is to maximize proﬁt dollars, not individual margins.
Here is a snapshot of our balance sheet. You can see it as of Q1 versus Q1 of '04. You
can see that we have more cash. We continue to grow our inventories but still
turning in the 12.5 to 13 turns per year over the past several quarters. And you can
see our ﬁxed assets also continue to grow. But modestly. And you -- which again I
think shows that we -- our model is demonstrating its eﬃciency.
Return on invested capital's 41% year-over-year, up from 32. We measure our ROIC
as free cash ﬂow divided by total assets minus current liabilities. And the
denominator is a 5 point average.
Our strategy. We always start with the customer and work backwards and we have
three customer sets I'm going to talk about very brieﬂy -- consumers, sellers. And
developers. Here is our virtuous cycle. The way you look at this chart is we start with
adding selection and making it more (inaudible) for customers.
We continue to work on customer experience. That drives traﬃc to not only to our
Website but to those individual detail pages. As we get more traﬃc to our individual
detail pages, that attracts third-party sellers and we continue to loop. That helps our
overall cost structure as we get large in those individual categories which enables us
to lower prices even further.
There are a number of diﬀerent ways in which we leverage our platform. We -- as of
Q1 Amazon is a seller. That is our inventory on our detail pages. We are the seller of
the record with 68% of our units. We are also third-party sellers which made up
about 32% of our total unit.
That's where we have third parties selling their inventory on our detail pages which
we earn commission on. Amazon Enterprise Solutions -- that's where we use our
technology to power third-party Websites and then Amazon Web Services we are
using our technology and selling those services to developers.
We think about consumers, we focus on these three pillars as we call them -- price,
selection. And convenience. And innovation is the foundation of everything that we
do.
Our pricing strategy is to not discount a small number of products for a limited
period of time but to oﬀer low prices broadly across our entire product range. Again,
our pricing strategy does not attempt to maximize margin percentages. But instead
seeks to maximize value for customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2009-06-10
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 4 of 15Here's how we think -- one of the ways we think about selection. You can see the
product category down the left hand side the page. You can see the individual
countries on the top of the Websites that we have across the top. The dates are in
the middle of -- the dates, the years that we launched those particular geographies.
So when you think about selection, we are adding new categories as you can see
from this chart. We have the opportunity to add even more categories. Many of the
blank spaces are on this page. There'll be categories that we launch that are not on
this page. And even categories that we have been in the longest, we are continuing
to add selection.
So those categories that we've been in since inception, we are still adding selection
today which again selection in our mind is great for customers and also a growth
driver. Here's an example of selection. This happens to be a separately branded
Website for shoes called Endless. It has unique customer proposition. It was
designed speciﬁcally for shoes. Again we have express shipping for free on Endless
overnight. It also has a diﬀerent look and feel than Amazon.com.
Another way we add convenience is through Prime. We have this oﬀer -- Prime
Service -- in a number of geographies today. Again in the US it's $79 express two
days on shipping.
Here is what it looks like by geography. We have free shipping in all the geographies
that we are in and you can see the prime membership oﬀering that we have in the
several geographies that we have it today as well as the oﬀering itself.
Innovation. There's a number of diﬀerent ways that we innovate, on behalf of
customers. This happens to be just an example of Kindle. You can see that we are
selling both our Kindle version and our Kindle DS.
MP3. Again, another way that we are innovating on behalf of customers. This is our
MP3 store and we continue to add selection on behalf of customers.
Selling. I talked brieﬂy about selling on Amazon. And this is just a snapshot of a
detail page. It happens to be a particular seller selling this gym application. If you
look closely you can see that it's eligible for Prime. The reason is, it's eligible for
Prime, that this happens to be fulﬁlled by Amazon seller and when you become a
fulﬁlled by Amazon seller, we allow those products to be sold in Amazon Prime as
well as free -- other free shipping oﬀers like super saver shipping.
In terms of sellers, we have more than 1.6 million sellers. We can see that is up year-
over-year from 1.3 million. Again I talked brieﬂy about performance by Amazon. We
have this available in the US, UK, Germany and Japan and in beta in France.
Some of the beneﬁts -- I talked brieﬂy already but, again, orders placed on
Amazon.com that qualify for super saver shipping and in some Prime, the sellers getFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2009-06-10

A - Tom Szkutakto use our fulﬁllment network and you can see some of the other beneﬁts that we
have. Again, Q1 of '09 -- and we shipped on the behalf of sellers using FP --
increased over 300% year-over-year.
Amazon Enterprise Solutions. This is where we power third-party Websites. This just
happens to be a snapshot of a few examples of that and so we provide that service
to sellers.
Web Services. Our strategy for Web Services is to help developers take their idea
and get to a successful product as quick as they can without having to do the
undiﬀerentiated heavy lifting. And so, we have a number of diﬀerent services. It is
something that we've been doing for a number of years for our own Websites
around the world. And to our oﬀering those services now to others.
Here's just a number of the diﬀerent services. I will go through the details. They are
also available on our Website and you can look at those and see the individual
oﬀerings.
In summary, the online model advantage we face many challenges, many
opportunities. But we are relentlessly focused on customer experience, consumers,
sellers and developers. We leverage our platform wherever we can. We think we are
well-positioned for growth. We are focused on optimizing long-term free cash ﬂow
and innovation at the foundation of everything that we do.
So with that we will open it up for questions.
Questions And Answers
Thanks, Tom, for the presentation. Maybe I'll just kick oﬀ Q&A and start with a
question about free cash ﬂow since that's one of your -- the Company's primary
metrics.
You talked about the beneﬁt you guys get from the operating cycle. So your change
in working capital is typically a contributor to your free cash ﬂow. But as you expand
into other diﬀerent lines of businesses, Kindle, Amazon, Web Services, how should
we think about -- how would that potentially aﬀect the working capital dynamics?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
Right. We have a -- we do have a very good operating cycle. We continue to expand
it to new geographies, new categories and new lines of business and all of those
categories and new initiatives, they all impact our work capital a little bit diﬀerent.
But the way you should think about it long-term is we feel still very good about
having -- getting very good leverage in our working capital across the business. WeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2009-06-10
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 6 of 15Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Tom Szkutakdon't break out those individual categories or individual businesses. But we feel very
good about the leverage that we have and that we will be able to get leverage going
forward as well.
So as you expanded into all these other new initiatives, we shouldn't expect a huge
change per se?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
No. Again we are not forecasting what that would be. But we still feel very good
about the leverage that we will get going forward.
Great. And was just curious in terms of you talked a bit about the third-party seller
eﬀort which is really taking oﬀ for you guys. Over a third of your units sold now. As
you -- how does the Company think about expanding into new categories. In terms
of doing it yourself versus leveraging a third-party strategy. My guess is that third
party is probably higher ROI. But smaller dollars to the bottom line.
So can you just walk us through how you got (multiple speakers)?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
Sure. You are right. Our third-party business is as I mentioned in some of the
opening remarks is about as of Q1 is about 32% of our unit. Just about a third. And
the way we think about categories is very few categories that don't have a
combination of both retail oﬀerings and third-party oﬀerings. And we like that. We
like the combination of the two.
And so as we launch new categories, we are actually launching with the concept of
having both retail oﬀerings and third-party oﬀerings. And so the reason is, we think
that they complement each other really well. With third-party sellers we are able to
add unique selection that maybe we can't get either initially or long-term. So it is
great for customers.
And we're always thinking about how we make sure that we get the best selection in
front of customers. And we ﬁnd that the combination of both retail and third parties
is the way to do it. We also like both types of parts of that business both retail
oﬀerings and sellers from a free cash ﬂow and long-term return standpoint.
And so we get this question a lot, which one do you like better? We like both. We
have teams that are across the world that are trying to make sure that we take care of
both of those customer sets being our end consumer as well as the customer set
that we call sellers. And we work very hard to make sure from a solid perspective we
take the same discipline we use on the consumer side, apply it to sellers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2009-06-10

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Tom SzkutakHow are we going to make sure that experience is as good as it could possibly can
be for those sellers selling on our platform so they get the information they need to
run their businesses? They could -- and what they want at sales and so we are trying
to make sure that we get traﬃc to those detail pages so that they can sell their
product.
And so there's a number of diﬀerent things that we have worked on and will
continue to work on to make that experience better. One example being Fulﬁlled by
Amazon which I talked about.
And you run into situations where there's a sense that there's always a natural
tension in a way with your owned and operated retail business versus third-party
strategy. How do you balance that, I guess? To make sure that there's (multiple
speakers).
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
Yes. We really don't look at it as a conﬂict. Our view is that if you start with the
customer and you do what's right for the customer, it's consistent. And also if you
think about it, transparency has improved pretty dramatically over the past several
years and I think it will continue to improve even more over the coming years.
So having third-party selling our detail pages is great for customers so they can see,
obviously, what we are committed to having great prices. They can also see that
ﬁrsthand by having competitive product, competitive oﬀerings right on our detailed
pages. They don't need to go anywhere. They can see that.
And they know that we are committed to oﬀering great value. So the combination of
those things is just, we think is working for us. We don't view them in conﬂict. We
view it as great for customers and we think that is proving to be good for
shareholders as well.
And maybe last question on the core e-commerce business. You mentioned analysts.
Is this -- should we read this as a maybe a change inside your new strategy to maybe
move into using other brands for diﬀerent product categories where you may get
(multiple speakers).
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
We tried the new things and this happens to be one that we've tried and it's going
very well. We like what we see there and we just thought that shoes, in particular,
some dynamics needed a diﬀerent experience. In other words something that's
designed speciﬁcally for the serious shoe shopper and so that we have some of the
things that we have having express shipping overnight. Free shipping we think is
good for customers and as one example. And so we just thought that that was aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2009-06-10

A - Tom Szkutakgood way to go and we like what we see so for. But it's again very early in that
category.
Great. Maybe let's shift gears a little bit and talk about Kindle which is something -- I
guess, a ton of press and we certainly get a lot of questions about it today. It's a -- I
think it would be helpful, if maybe you just talked about the Company's view of the
business model for the Kindle. Should we think about it as a razor, razor blade type
of business model? Or looking at (inaudible) you make money on both the hardware
and the software. But maybe you can talk about that a little bit?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
Yes. We think that we can make good returns over time in the device and the content
and the Kindle is certainly a purpose device. It's built speciﬁcally for long-form
reading. And again, we're very excited about what we've seen so far and there's
certainly a lot of it. And we've been working on it for a number of years now and we
will continue to work on that experience to get it better. And so you have seen a lot
of innovation to date and you'll see even more going forward.
And so we are excited about what we have seen so far.
Kindle's attacking both the textbook market as well as the consumer books market.
The -- which -- where do -- is there -- is that -- are those two markets an equal priority
for you guys with respect to the Kindle? Or do you --?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
Sure. From a Kindle perspective all -- you know, we are focused on all book readers.
We want to make sure that that experience is great for all book and newspapers and
blogs and magazines. And so we will continue to work on that experience. We think
the experience is good so far. We are going to try to keep making that better, again,
for all those mediums.
You talked about your media business being a relatively large chunk of the revenues
and within that you have books, DVDs. And music. And as these three media types
transition to digital, Kindle is clearly your answer for books.
You talked a little bit about your music initiative and then you also have Amazon
video on demand. So could you just talk a little bit about what the other -- the
strategies are, speciﬁcally, for music and for DVDs as those media types make that
transition to digital?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2009-06-10
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 9 of 15Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Tom SzkutakSure. In terms of music, we think that oﬀering a great collection in music and have
that available and make it as convenient as possible for customers. Making sure that
the retail basics like our other categories in terms of pricing is very, very good.
And so those are the fundamental things that we're working on. We oﬀer it in an
MP3-free format in a number of geographies. We launched France this morning. And
so, again, we continue to make -- we are going to continue to innovate on behalf of
customers in the music space and make those oﬀerings get better and better over
time.
In terms of video, we do have video on demand service. We have over 40,000 titles
today. We've done a number of things to make it more convenient for customers in
terms of use on their preferred hardware choice. And we are going to continue to
work on adding selection, make sure we have great prices for customers. Making
sure that we have diﬀerent options to view our products, whether that be a purchase
or other way.
And so again those are things that we're working on and we are going to continue to
innovate on behalf of the customers in that space.
Just a follow-up question on those two topics. For music, what would be the
incentive for a consumer to buy the MP3 on Amazon as opposed to going to iTunes
and then (inaudible) me for video -- what's the diﬀerentiator for Amazon video on
demand versus some of the other oﬀerings in the marketplace?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
Sure. I think I'm not talking about any speciﬁc company. But just versus others. Again
we want to have that selection in both. So we want customers to know when they
come to Amazon that they can ﬁnd exactly what they are looking for. We want to
make sure that they ﬁnd that selection whether it be either of those music or video
that it's a great economic choice for them.
Then the last one becomes convenience. And we are going to continue to innovate
and make it more convenient for customers. And so, an example would be on the
digital tech side and with Kindle in that particular case, we decided that we thought
a special-purpose device was warranted. And we innovated, on behalf of customers
so that they can get selection.
We have selection on over 300,000 titles they can get directly into their device
today in less than 60 seconds. Our long-term vision is to get every book ever printed
in any language available on Kindle in less than 60 seconds. So it gives you a view of
again it's a long-term goal. But it's (multiple speakers).
Yes. It is a big goal. It's a long-term goal. But again we have teams of people that are
very focused on improving that experience. And we apply that same rigor as you
have probably seen in other categories and in terms of that selection trying to makeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2009-06-10

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Tom Szkutakit more convenient for customers and we will apply that same -- and are applying
that same discipline to music and video-on-demand.
Then since you brought back up the topic of Kindle. I noticed that you have an app
for the iPhone for the Kindle which is most of -- mostly more of a reader than
anything else. But should we read into that as Amazon being platform-agnostic in a
certain way? Or am I reading too much into that?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
Well we are very happy with the application and you should expect to see a similar
application on other devices moving forward. But the way you should think about it
is it works very well with the Kindle. It's another word that we have something called
Whisper Sync so if you are using your Kindle and you get your iPhone, it picks up
right where you left oﬀ. Same when you stop reading on your iPhone and go back to
your Kindle, it will pick up where you left oﬀ. So we think that technology is good.
But again the Kindle is made for, again, purpose device for long-term, long-form
reading for people who like to read. Who are serious readers. And I guess the best
analogy I would give would be very similar to a camera.
On phones you'll see cameras; and for some people, that camera, that application if
you will of a camera on a cell phone is good. And it's ﬁne for what they do. They
might take a small amount of pictures and that's suitable for them.
For others they need -- they want also a camera. If they are more serious then they
take more cameras. I would say the same thing is true for Kindle. If you are a serious
reader you want -- there's a lot of device -- just having a dedicated device is
purposely designed for the reader.
Okay. Maybe the last question for me before I open it up to the audience. I just went
back to the ﬁnancials. In terms of CapEx, most companies have to go through
periods of investing versus harvesting. If we look at Amazon's CapEx to revenue
ratio, that's actually been ﬂattish or declining over the last couple of years.
How should we think about capital spending going forward for you guys? Is that
right to think as of Amazon as going through periods of investment versus
reinvestment or is it a diﬀerent dynamic?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
We haven't given guidance beyond the current quarter. So I can't talk too much
about what will happen in the future. But the way we are thinking about, I'll call it our
technology spending, is we continue as you've seen over the past couple of
quarters, we continue to invest in our business. We are looking certainly long-term to
make sure that we get great returns for shareholders over the long-term.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2009-06-10

Q - Rich ValeraWe are also very mindful of the environment we're in. We are being very selective in
what we invest in and that's how we are thinking about it. So you can see that we are
still investing in the business. We think appropriately so and there's not much more I
can add to that.
Super. With that, let me up questions to the audience. A question in the back there.
So I've heard some rumors about Wal-Mart entering the third-party marketplace,
essentially with a similar model. Just wondering if you'd do anything about that or
would you comment on thoughts there?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
Yes and I apologize. We have a long-standing practice of not talking about what
others are doing or might do. So I can't comment on that. But again from a seller
standpoint, we are focused on doing what is right for sellers. We work very hard to
improve our experience there and we are going to continue to stay heads down
focused on improving that experience even further.
Just a quick question on the Kindle. In light of the consumer environment, the
questions with the rush to the Kindle, how does it save the consumer money to buy
the device and then buy the books? I mean is there a break even where you buy a
certain number of books where it ends up saving you money? How do we think
through that?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
I think the Kindle is certainly something that's very convenient for customers. And I
think each individual consumer would have to do their own map in terms of what
types of books they buy and -- that is very convenient on the Kindle 2. You can hold
up to 1500 books, for example on the Kindle DS, which we announced a few weeks
back. You can hold up to 3500 books.
So it's very convenient. Pricing is very very competitive. Most best sellers are $9.99 or
less. So if you look at from a pricing standpoint, it's certainly very, very price-
competitive oﬀerings for that content once you've purchased the device.
Yes at some point you buy enough books and save enough money there to the
reader pays for itself right at some point in time.

Page 12 of 15A - Tom Szkutak
Q - Rich Valera
A - Tom SzkutakFollowing up on the last question, not to gang up on Kindles. But two interrelated
questions. One, why shouldn't the e-version of the book be sold at a premium and a
substantial one, given that it is a more convenient format?
Secondarily from the publisher's point of view, they still have to ship the same
number of books into the channel for the next four or ﬁve years. So actually you've
made their problem a little worse, which is they still have to pay for costs there. They
are not going away. They make go away long-term but not in the short-term.
And now they actually have higher returns because some people are buying it in an
e-format. So how do you --?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
So could you repeat the last part. I didn't hear the last.
{BIO 1922955 <GO>}
Well they are still shipping on a given title. Say, a normal freight hardbound book.
100,000 units or 130,000 units into the physical channel. Historically they get 20%
back. Now those return reserves are actually going up.
So they are still bearing the paper costs. But they are actually having a higher return
reserve. Their printing costs as a percentage of revenue are actually going up.
So how do you address that problem in the short-term and the issue that if the book
is more valuable in this format, it probably ought to be priced to premium anyway?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
Let me take that in two parts. The ﬁrst one is around pricing. We just think that we are
trying to make sure that it's very attractive for customers to buy digital books. And
we think we're trying to make it -- these books available so that customers actually
even buy more over time in terms of collection.
This, certainly, if you buy a physical book you have the ability to resell that. For
example if you buy a physical book you can buy that new and resell that used on
Amazon. Or you can buy it used and resell it used. You can't do that with digital text.
So all those factors we took into account when setting the pricing for digital books.
We also though, from a publisher standpoint, we actually think about what a
publisher has to do. They have to estimate what the production run is going to be.
They have to estimate a number of diﬀerent factors -- if a run has been completed
and sold out and customers want that book, there's still demand for it, they have to
make a judgment call about are they going to do another run. How big the run is
going to be.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2009-06-10

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantWith Kindle and with digital text, you never run out of stock. You can -- you don't
have all the associated paper costs that you are describing. So I think there are a lot
of advantages for the system and ultimately for customers over the long-term. And
so again we are very excited the impact it would have for customers as well as
authors and publishers over time.
Question. Two more questions. I think -- Tom is the one up front.
Recently you've been able to put up a very impressive revenue growth of about 25%
in the worst consumer economy in 30-some years. So it begs the question what
happens if you go back to a robust consumer economy next year and your revenue
growth is 50% and that would be something like $11 billion of incremental revenue.
Can you scale, can you reach -- can you satisfy that level of demand?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
Again we're not -- I can't comment on what we will do next year in terms of revenue.
In fact, one of the reasons why we're giving only quarterly guidance is because it is
very challenging in this environment to predict what will happen.
But in terms of scaling as we grow, we've got a great team that around the world that
works on exactly that problem and that challenge. And they have been working on it
for a number of years. And we -- it's ﬁlled from a fulﬁllment capacity standpoint. It is
also from an infrastructure standpoint to run our various Websites.
And the teams do a great job of planning and in our case when you talk about
scaling like that, we are most concerned -- we are certainly concerned with all
periods of the year. But there's special emphasis on peak. Which in our case the
peak of our retail business is in December during the holiday season. So we have
teams of people that are working on how we are going to make sure that we can
fulﬁll that demand not only for this quarter. But for -- excuse me, for this year during
peak. But also subsequent periods. And they just do a great job.
Again that is both on the Fulﬁllment site and the infrastructure side. The
infrastructure peak for our retail business obviously is as we get all of that traﬃc to
our Website during that same period, it is within a few days of our Fulﬁllment peak.
So again we feel very good about our potential for scale as we get growth and we
have just a great global team, several global teams that work on those two things.
My question is on the Checkout by Amazon. How do you -- what do you do -- how
does it compare to let's say what PayPal does? And long-term what do you see
yourselves in the space doing in the long-term?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2009-06-10

Sure. We have a number of a few diﬀerent payment services. And I think probably
the best thing to do, they are really oﬀered for the developers. And so, the best thing
to do would be -- I will describe them brieﬂy. But to go actually to our Website and
look at them and we have it in a great amount of detail.
But it is a way to oﬀer our payment services to third parties for developers. So it
would be very similar to other Web services that we provide and again it is a way that
third-party developers can use those services. So that, for example if a developer will
work to take it and use it on a particular Website that you wouldn't have to enter into
all the credentials that are secure within the Amazon environment, we would allow
that service to be used so that if you knew that you were as a customer the way you
would see this is that you would know you were using the Amazon payment services.
And so that you could essentially check out using your Amazon credentials in a very
secure environment. And know that insecure and so that's the theory behind it.
But again for the individual details, I think it is a great question. You should go right
to our Website for -- under Amazon Payments and you'll see the details speciﬁcally
of those services.
Thank you.
Any other questions? I think we -- I don't see any more. But maybe I'll just take the
opportunity to ask one more myself and then we will let you oﬀ the hook, Tom. So
just going back to Kindle real quick. How do you guys view the argument that
ultimately e-books should really be based on kind of an open format, open
standards versus closed systems?
You know how do you see -- what are the beneﬁts of, I guess, doing it the Amazon
way versus being based on open standards?
{BIO 5025269 <GO>}
The way we are thinking about it is we are actually letting the content owners,
publishers. And content owners decide what the format is. And long-term, they are
the ones who will decide what that format is. And we are building an environment
that will be accepting of either a protected or unprotected formats.
Great. Thank you very much for your time. We appreciate it.
