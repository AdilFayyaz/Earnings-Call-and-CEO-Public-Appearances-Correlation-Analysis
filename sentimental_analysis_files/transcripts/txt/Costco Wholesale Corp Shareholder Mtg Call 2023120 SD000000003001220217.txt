Good day, and welcome to Costco Wholesale Corporation 2023 Annual Meeting of

you'd like to change your vote or vote your shares, you may do so while the polls are
open by following the instructions on your screen.
The record date for the meeting was the close of business on November 11th, 2022.
Each shareholder record on November 11th was mailed a notice of availability of
proxy statement on or about December 10th. The proxy statement was posted on
our corporate website on December 6th. Aﬃdavits of the mailing and the posting of
these materials will be attached to the minutes of this meeting. A complete list of
shareholders of record entitled to vote is available for your inspection through the
link on your meeting page. This list will be kept open for inspection during the entire
meeting. To conduct business we need a quorum, and a quorum for this meeting is a
majority of the shares entitled to vote. The Inspector of Election has reported that we
do indeed have a quorum today.
I will now review the items put to a shareholder vote and the preliminary results of
the voting. We will close the polls very shortly, so please vote now if you have not
already done so. Item one, all current board members have been renominated to
serve again until the next Annual Meeting. I reviewed the nominees in each of their
backgrounds in my introductory remarks. The nominees have all been reelected with
substantial majorities of the vote. Item two is to ratify the selection of KPMG as our
auditor. This item also passed with over 96% of the shares voting. Item three is an
advisory vote to approve the compensation of the company's executive oﬃcers. This
item passes well with over 95% of the shares voting. Item four is an advisory vote to
approve the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of the
company's executive oﬃcers. The frequency of one year was approved with over
98% of the shares voting. Item ﬁve, in addition, we have one shareholder proposal,
item ﬁve concerns reporting on risks of state policies restricting reproductive rights.
We'll now play pre-recorded statements by the shareholder proposing this
resolution and from the company explaining why we believe this proposal is not in
the company's best interest. We respectfully request that you vote against this
proposal.
{BIO 22511447 <GO>}
Good morning. My name is Julia Cederholm from investment management ﬁrm,
Arjuna Capital, and I move Proposal 5, asking the company to assess the risks and
costs of state policies that restrict reproductive rights. Reproductive rights are under
siege in the United States. Risking company's ability to attract and retain female
talent. (Inaudible) decision, abortion is currently banned in 13 states, severely
restricted in ﬁve states, and at risk in another 10 states. About one-third of Costco's
employees live in states that severely restrict abortion availability, meaning its female
employees are unable to easily access necessary healthcare. Numerous studies show
that when women are unable to access abortion care, they are more likely to drop
out of the workforce. This lack of abortion access also impacts company's ability to
attract talent in these states. Additionally, there are large-scale societal repercussions
from limiting abortion access.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-20
Costco Wholesale Corp (COST US Equity)
Page 3 of 13Hamilton E James "Tony"The Institute for Women's Policy Research estimates over 0.5 million more women of
reproductive age would enter the workforce if all restrictions were eliminated. Our
company states it has worked to create stability with its female workforce through
competitive wages and beneﬁts. While we recognize Costco has done this in the
past, the legal environment post-jobs [ph] is profoundly diﬀerent. Costco must stay
abreast of state policies restricting reproductive rights and proactively work to
protect its female workforce in these states. Costco's current reproductive health
beneﬁts also do not fully protect our company from the risks associated with state
policies limiting abortion access. While travel and lodging reimbursements help
female employees in restricted states, these women still face additional barriers to
receiving an abortion. Therefore, Costco must consider all risks associated with the
current political environment as it relates to abortion and consider ways to mitigate
these risks. This might include public policy advocacy or reviewing political
contributions, amongst other strategies that would help protect women from
abortion restrictions. As this is a critical time to protect women's abortion access, we
urge you to support Proposal 5.
Hello, this is Tony James, Costco's Board Chair. Directors respectfully urges a vote
against Proposal 5. As many of you know, we take great pride at Costco in our
relationship with our employees and are widely known for being a responsive and
caring employer committed to our people. In addition to a strong historical and
current focus on generous pay and beneﬁts, we have in recent years enhanced our
communications with our workforce. Engagement surveys, culture-building
meetings, training programs and extensive follow-up eﬀorts. These and other
initiatives help Craig and Ron and their teams (technical diﬃculty) in close touch with
employee concerns and address them eﬀectively. Eﬀorts have shown success and
are reﬂected in the high quality of our employees and the great retention rates we
enjoy. Recognize that the topic of reproductive rights can be divisive, but we don't
believe there is any genuine controversy concerning our employee satisfaction with
our healthcare plans in this regard, nor has our coverage adversely impacted our
success in attracting and retaining employees.
Importantly, the plan's fund expenses for those who must travel to obtain
reproductive services covered under the plan. We will continue to pay close
attention to legal and other developments around reproductive rights and their
impact on our workforce. If our monitoring eﬀorts reveal a new area of need among
employees, we will respond appropriately. However, imposing special reporting
obligations on the company is not necessary and would be a signiﬁcant added
expense. As a result, your Board of Directors urges a vote against proposal ﬁve.
Thank you for your attention on that. The preliminary vote counts show that the
shareholder proposal item ﬁve did not pass, receiving less than 15% of the vote. The
oﬃcial business is now closed, the polls are declared closed and the Inspector of
Election will tabulate the votes and the ﬁnal results will be reported in our 8K, which
will be ﬁled shortly. As chair of the meeting, I now declare the oﬃcial meeting
adjourned. Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-20

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our Annual January '23
Meeting. So we started out 2022 with 815 warehouses. We opened up 23 new
Costcos last year, ending with 838. Since the beginning of the September ﬁscal year,
we've opened up nine Costcos and we currently have 847 as of today. Just to go
through a few of the Costcos that we opened up this year, our San Marcos Business
Center was our 23rd US business center. We continue to see an opportunity for this
business and we're using a lot of our relocation sites to open up these business
centers. So there's a real future with these. In Canada, we open up our 61 in Anjou,
Quebec. Malibu, Japan was our 31st location in Japan we opened up this year.
College Station, Texas was number 34 in our Texas market. Murrieta, California, our
123rd building that we have in the state of California, which is our largest presence of
Costcos. Auckland, New Zealand, this was our ﬁrst building in the New Zealand
market that started out very well for us and we're looking to open up at least three
more in that market. Gocheok, Korea which was our 18th building in Korea. This is
what the building looked like when we ﬁrst found the site. It was a prison. This is
what it looks like today. So it's amazing what you can do in diﬀerent countries with
real estate and those are the all the high rises have been built behind it. Stockholm,
Sweden, our ﬁrst building in Sweden, and we would hope to open up our second
one sometime in the end of '23 or the beginning of '24. Lake Stevens, Washington
was our 31st location in the state of Washington and the state is where we started at
'01 Seattle. Castorina, Australia was our 14th building in Australia and this is in our
Perth Market.
Some of the other locations we opened up this year Riverton, Utah which is a ﬁll-in
market for us in Utah. Ontario, St. Augustine. Florida, which is in the Jacksonville
market. Verona, Wisconsin, which was our 10th building in the Wisconsin Market.
Gimhae, Korea. University ofMissouri, which is a ﬁll-in the Springﬁeld market. Athens,
Georgia. Ankeny, Iowa, which is also in the Iowa market near our Des Moines
location and Logan, Utah.
Costco today were the third largest global retailer with 11th largest on the Fortune
500 and we currently have a market cap of $214 billion. Sales last year $223 billion.
We currently have 124 million square feet of selling space. We currently have
304,000 employees worldwide. Warehouses were in 14 regions. We have 847
warehouses worldwide. The majority of them, about 730 are in North America. As
you could see the other opportunities there in these other regions will continue not
only ﬁll-in in the US but look in these other markets to expand. Costco today, 67
million member households, 121 million card holders, one of the things we're veryFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-20
Costco Wholesale Corp (COST US Equity)
Page 5 of 13proud of is our renewal rate worldwide over 90%. And obviously, the membership
revenue was very important to our whole model, $4.3 billion in membership fees
collected in the last 12 months.
In this last ﬁscal year 2022, $222.730 billion. Our net income, $5.844 billion. Our
diluted earning per share, $13.14, which is up from $11.27. So we're very happy with
last year's results considering the situation in the economy. Our ﬁrst quarter, again,
we're very pleased with $53.437 billion. Net income, $1.364 billion, $3.07 a share
compared to $2.98 last year. Our comp traﬃc frequency, which -- what we gauge our
growth of our business along with sales for the previous 2009 through 2019, our
comp traﬃc was 4% a year; '20 because of COVID, we dropped down to less than
1%; coming out of COVID for '21 and '22, very strong years in terms of comp traﬃc;
and this year, we're slightly less than 4% for the ﬁrst quarter of business. So although
it's not 7%, we're continuing to be pleased with our traﬃc as we've continued to
grow the business.
Some of our highlights, although you've seen deﬂation in TV's, our global TV sales
were up 5% in '22. Our apparel business continues to be strong, up 12%. Diamonds,
although slowed up a little bit from 2021, we sold over 500,000 carats of diamonds
globally. Our beer, wine, and spirits one of the softed sears [ph] in terms of increase
at only 3%. We attribute that mostly to restaurants and bars opening backup where
people were consuming probably more alcohol at home than they were in
restaurants and bars previously. That was not the case last year.
Produce, up 7% globally. Our bakery, global sales up 16%. This was actually the
biggest growth in terms of bakery sales over the last ﬁve years as a percentage per
year. Meat & Seafood, global sales up 5% and we're actually happy with that because
we had such challenges with stay-in-stock [ph] and chicken and ﬁsh this year. Service
deli our all reliable 117 million chicken sold last year. Some of our merchandise
highlights, we continue to look for new brands. You have Alaska Airlines, Jacuzzi,
Impossible, All-Clad, Hurley, Calvin Klein, Major League Baseball, Pendleton. These
are just some of the new brands that we're bringing in last year and we'll have again
this year.
Some of the new items that we're looking at is a deli sushi program, family pack,
$28.99 to a crunch roll combo $13.99. So far our sushi business is growing quite well
for us. Some of the other items Kirkland Signature as you know that's our own brand
that we're very proud of just some of the items, KS caramel S'mores clusters, $9.49.
KS roasted almonds, we sell for $9.99. KS chunks and gravy wet cat food, $26.99. KS
laundry scent beads $9.99. Some of the other items are Reposado, Tequila, again,
grow the Kirkland Signature brand and bring value. KS aerosol light whipped cream,
$5.49. Our organic pine nut hummus, $5.99. Cherry cheese pastry in our bakeries,
$9.99. Our new Aero [ph] Kit $6.49 a pound. I encourage you all to try these new
items.
Some of the other items are Kirkland Signature wide [ph] burner, top sear burner
grill, $890.999. Barbecued hardwood pellets, $12.99. One of the things that we're
also very proud of our commitment to sustainability in terms of reducing plastic andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-20
Costco Wholesale Corp (COST US Equity)
Page 6 of 13reducing prices. I just want to take your journey on this KS cashew packaging
progression, which is these cashews are one of our top items in our nut business.
In 1995, when we introduced the item, we had a round container, we moved to a jar
comparison [ph] square jar in 2008 and we had a 23% reduction in plastic. In 2009,
we went to Emboss Jar, and we had a 5% reduction in plastic. In 2022, we reduced
the plastic, what we went to -- what we call a V4, reduced the weight 10.5% in plastic.
And this year, we went to actually a bag conversion, which reduced it another 85%
and reduced the price to for [ph] $11 million in savings to our members. So a lot of
opportunity here to continue to do the right thing plus reduce the pricing of our
merchandise.
Some of the other things we're doing with packaging, this is Korea, we've gone from
plastic boxes to a box and composable ﬁlm, reducing 400,000 pounds of plastic.
One of the things that we're very good at, we're a true global company. We move
goods from not only the US to other countries where we do business, but also we
move goods from other countries to the US and other countries. So here's some of
the items, shredded squid from Thailand, very big item that we brought over here in
the US, that cooked octopus from Spain, seaweed salad from Korea. These are all
global items that we found that work in all countries where we do business.
Our online presence we currently have in eight regions. Our e-commerce business,
we want to complement the core warehouse convenience and big and bulky
purchases, we want to have grocery online, all coming to your house, expanded
selection year-round, delivering insulation available, same day delivery available,
and expand the Costco treasure hunt. These are what we want to accomplish with e-
commerce this year.
One of the other things we're getting ourselves involved in is Costco Next. Costco
Next is going to be actually more brands that you have available to you that will
come directly from the supplier in itself. It's going to be a selection of goods that our
buyers have found from these suppliers that we can't necessarily carry in our
warehouses and they'll be exclusive values for our members. So I encourage you to
go on Costco Next and look at the savings on additional item selection that you
might like. Some of the areas home improvement, beauty, apparel, art, sports and
bicycles, outdoor recreation. Some of the brands of Briggs & Riley, priority bicycles,
which is electric bikes and SPIRE Fitness, Studio Sheds, Thomas Kinkade, again,
these are all direct from the supplier delivered to your home. Our grocery online
options for home delivery. We currently have same-day delivery available through
Instacart. We have two-day delivery that's available through Costco Grocery. And
also we have cold and frozen delivery from Costco Grocery.
Also, we have other exciting merchandise available, Samsung French Door
Refrigerator, Sports Memorabilia, you see a Patrick Holmes signed helmet there for
$1,300. La Priere ﬁrming face treatment $1,500. Our jewelry, although not as big as
previous years in terms of dollars, three signature items this year, a four-carat pear-
shaped diamond ring, $90,000; a yellow diamond ring fancy 7.5 carat, $90,000 and
a four-carat radiant diamond ring for $85,000. That's the highlight of some of ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-20
Costco Wholesale Corp (COST US Equity)
Page 7 of 13jewelry items this year. Gift cards and tickets online, we continue to have gift cards
from Southwest Airlines, $500 cash card for $449.99. DoorDash, $100 for $89.99. And
we have Super Bowl packages anywhere from $10,000 to $43,000 this year
available.
Our mobile app, something that we continue to improve on. Feature shop online,
Costco, visa card, and your digital membership card locations where we have gas
stations and our gas prices, some of the enhancements we're going to add for next
year, which includes something that everybody's asked for warehouse inventory
online and as we go move forward, you'll be seeing new features available over
time. Our depots, one of the lifeblood of our distributions and keeping in stock. We
currently have 26 global depots in eight regions, 18 e-com fulﬁllment centers and we
have 10 DDC locations, which are responsible for taking in big and bulky and
delivering to our smaller last mile locations.
Costco Logistics, which is something that we actually purchased probably almost two
years ago from Sears was this last-mile logistics company. We think that long term it's
going to increase member service level. You can also have room of where you want
it delivered or white glove. We can reduce ship time with forward deployed goods,
lower member prices with full cost transparency and expand our online categories,
and also controlling the delivery experience. Last year $3.76 billion in sales on 3.2
million shipments. 10 middle-mile distribution centers, which I mentioned were the
DDCs. 121 ﬁnal mile delivery facilities including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. We
currently have 700 home delivery trucks on the road delivering six days a week.
These are some of the categories that you can have delivered direct to your home.
Exercise, large TV's, barbecues, vanities and kitchen ensembles. Some of the other
things that we have in there, washer dryers, TVs, riding lawn mowers, furniture,
anything that might be something that you can't get in your car, we usually can get it
delivered through Costco Logistics.
Our business centers, as I said before, continue to be part of our future walk-in
delivery for business members, e-commerce fulﬁllment. We currently have 23 in the
US, six in Canada. Our pharmacy is considered to be one of our staples in our
business, 56 million prescriptions in '22. In '22, are also immunizations were very big.
We gave 3.5 million immunizations last year. Our optical business 8.2 million pairs of
glasses sold last year. Our food court all reliable 156 million hot dogs at $1.50 sold
globally last year. Our gasoline, up 22% in gallons. Our tires, 10 million tires sold
globally last year. Our tire business continues to grow and we continue to gain
market share.
Sustainability, which is very important to us. Our sustainability commitment, if you'll
go online, you'll be able to ﬁnd this we updated in '22, and you'll also see our
climate action plan on there. We basically have four pillars. Our commitment, people
and communities, our operations, our merchandising and our climate action plan.
And again, this can all be found on our Costco website. We currently for our
employees 304,000 employees, we pay premium beneﬁts. We feel that we have
industry-leading compensation. Our average US hourly wage, $26; $31 hour wage for
10-year service or over beneﬁts for full-time and part-time employees. And we feelFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-20
Costco Wholesale Corp (COST US Equity)
Page 8 of 13A - Hamilton E James "Tony"we have a stable workforce, 32% of our employees have more than 10 years of
service and we have a low turnover after a year of less than 10%.
Our community is, we feel we have a responsibility to get back in the communities
where we do business. 1% of our pretax proﬁts donated over $65 million in 2022
United Way Red Cross Children's Hospitals, we invested $25 million in a black
Economic Development Fund, feeding America $5.5 million in cash grants and over
90 million pounds of food and other products donated. And World Vision, over $275
million in merchandise donated. Our commitment to operations remain eﬃcient to
stay a low-cost operator. Expand our star program globally to help us remain in
compliance with regulations, reduce water usage, reduce energy usage, reduce
waste, and most important continue and reduced emissions. Our commitment to
merchandise, we ask our suppliers six major questions. Can you map your supply
chain? How are the people treated? How are the animals treated? How is the
environment treated, with we want to focus on water, forestry, and ﬁsheries? Is the
best possible packaging being used? What are your missions and plans to reduce
them? These are all questions that we continue to ask our suppliers on everything
that we may buy from them.
Our climate action plan, we met all of our milestones while supporting seven US
sustainable development goals. We reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 absolute
emissions from operations and increase our reduction commitment from 20% to
39% in 2030, which is our goal. Determined global Scope 3 emissions 97 % are on
our supply chain and will be determined reduction commitment by December of
2023 and develop a robust action plan to reduce our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.
Our ﬁnancial position; cash, $11.06 billion; property and equipment, $25 billion; long-
term debt, not a lot of debt, $6.5 billion; our shareholder's equity $21,476 million.
Our dividends, we've been paying a dividend since 2004. We started at $0.40 per
share. We're currently at $3.60 per share. That's a growth rate of 13% per year and we
pay $1.6 billion annually. We've also had four special dividends in the last 10 years.
Our stock repurchase program, we started in ﬁscal 2005, we've spent over $10
billion in buying back stock of 133 million shares. We've retired with an average price
of almost $76. Last year, we repurchased $442 million at an average price of $511.44.
What we do is continue to open up Costcos. In 2019, as you just know we opened up
20. Because of COVID, in 2020, we dropped down to 13. We rebounded in 2021 with
20 buildings. And last year '23 ﬁscal 2023 and forward we'll open up 24 plus
buildings a year. Our company annual growth net sales since December of $85 has
grown at 12.4%, our income of over 13%, our stock price has appreciated annually an
average of 17% compared to the S&P at 8.7%. Well, now, we'll open it up for
questions. Thank you.

A - Hamilton E James "Tony"Now at this moment, we feel very good about where our inventories stand. We're
roughly up 10% from last year, which takes into consideration the inﬂation. If you look
at last year at this time, we did have what we call deep freeze with some Christmas
goods. But we're very clean and we're in a good position going into spring and
summer.
Craig, in this time of inﬂation 6.5% nationwide in 2022. And how many people are
struggling to make ends meet? Is now a good time to raise membership prices?
{BIO 1505432 <GO>}
When you talk about and I assume that you're asking in terms of our membership to
be a member. At this time, we always talk about this not only from a company
standpoint but also in our board meetings. And in the past, we have taken up the
membership fee. In our opinion right now is not the time to do it. That's not to say
that at some point we won't. But at the moment we have no plans to take up the fee.
Craig, in lieu of an annual vote on executive compensation, would the board or the
compensation committee of the board ﬁnd a triennial shareholder vote that aﬀorded
shareholders a vote on the overall plan as well as separate votes on annual incentive
pay, long-term incentive pay and post-employment pay to be a more useful and
informative alternative?
{BIO 1505432 <GO>}
Well to answer about the annual vote, we just voted annually, the shareholders voted
to do it annually. So I don't know that I can speak to that. To some of the other issues
that you brought up. We can certainly look at those and evaluate those. I don't know
that I'm capable right at the moment to give you a response. So but we'll certainly
take those under advisement and look at them.
Craig, has any thought or research been given to allow customers to be able to scan
items into a cart on the app as they shop instead of doing it all at the register?
{BIO 1505432 <GO>}
We've always looked at ways that we can enhance our digital checkout and our
checkout process all the time. So we're continuing to evaluate things. We don't know
if that's the best way to do things at the moment, but we will continue to look at all
possible checkout future processes that are available digitally.
Is Costco ever going to get its milk jugs designed so they don't dribble down the
side of the jug when you pour? I have been complaining about this for over 10 years
and it is a daily irritant. All other products are so consumer-driven.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-20

Well, we appreciate the compliment on our other products. The milk jug was
something that we probably been working on 15 years. We improved it probably 10
years ago. The last four years, we've thought we improved it and ﬁxed this problem
with our last engineering that we did on the bottle. Now as you know we have
diﬀerent producers out there. So if you could send me an e-mail where you purchase
your milk and we could certainly look at some of these bottlers to see what the
problem may be, if it's in the container if it's how it's being bottled. I haven't heard
many complaints recently, so if you'll send me an e-mail, we'll certainly look at the
bottler that's near your area.
Craig, is it true there are plans to double the number of warehouses in the next 10
years? If so, how big is too big for this corporation?
{BIO 1505432 <GO>}
Well, we currently have 877 -- 847 buildings and to say that we're going to double
the amount of Costcos in the next 10 years may be diﬃcult to do. There's certainly
other countries that we continue to look at to say that we could certainly double our
amount of sales over the next 10 years if something that's probably not -- that's
probably very possible to do.
Craig, some of your suppliers like JBS and Smithﬁeld, still keep pregnant sales in
crates where they can't even turn around for ﬁve to six weeks before they decide if
they're pregnant or when they're pregnant. Are you going to ask JBS and Smithﬁeld
to stop these conﬁnement practices? I'm very concerned about this for fresh pork,
Kirkland Signature cooler items, and bacon products.
{BIO 1505432 <GO>}
We're very concerned about all animal welfare. And if you go on our website and
look at our sustainability commitment, you'll see that we're doing everything
possible to create a human environment for all animals. We continue -- we'll continue
to work with our pork suppliers and try to reduce conﬁnement as much as possible.
So we're committed to trying to do that.
Craig, will Costco continue to invest in -- to increasing plant-based food options?
{BIO 1505432 <GO>}
Well, we're always looking at whatever our member want. Members will tell us what
they want and we will continue to try to ﬁll those needs. We are increasing the plant-
based options that we have and we will continue to look at doing that as long as we
have a member who wants to purchase those goods.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-20

A - W Craig JelinekCraig, is the company experiencing any supply issues in the food category and if so,
which speciﬁc areas?
{BIO 1505432 <GO>}
Well, when you say supply issues, there's times that we have issues out there with
chickens, based of you know about the inﬂuence out there that's out in the ﬁelds.
We've also had issues with eggs. Diﬀerent suppliers have diﬀerent issues with raw
materials. So yes, there's some suppliers with some issues, but that's happened from
time to time over the years and I don't see that's a real problem long term.
Craig, the Albuquerque store on Renaissance has a propane ﬁlling station. Is this
something that will be opened in other locations?
{BIO 1505432 <GO>}
We've tested -- let me start someplace else here. We (technical diﬃculty) have
propane stations in Canada where we really started them. We tried them in about 20
US locations. I don't see if it's moving out in any more US locations, but we'll
continue to put them in Canada.
Hey, much loved bread that commands an $8.99 per loaf price tag, cranberry walnut
bread is seasonal, why? Perhaps Costco should consider creating and listening to
user groups to advise on questions like seasonality when they are raised.
{BIO 1505432 <GO>}
Now I'm thinking, are you talking about the bakery, I assume? We've always been a
company that kind of tries to rotate out products. We have a few basics but continue
to rotate in and out of products and change so we don't keep the same stuﬀ and
change people's buying habits. So we'll certainly look at this. I can't give you an
answer right now on what we're planning on doing with that bread, but we would
certainly look at it.
Well, warehouses become leads certiﬁed, it comes with tax incentives.
{BIO 1505432 <GO>}
Well, let's just the tax centers aside, we will continue to build our buildings to lead
standards. So if in fact there's some type of tax that advantage to us, we would
certainly look at that. But our ideal situation is do what's right and build to that
standard.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-20

A - W Craig JelinekCraig, how do you train your current manager so that they draw correct lessons from
history, retain a clear understanding of the importance of culture instilled by Jim
Sinegal and Sol Price?
{BIO 1505432 <GO>}
Well, you obviously, we try to make sure as you get bigger it can become more
complicated, but you continue to run the business accordingly. And I think over the
last 40-plus years, we have tried to maintain that culture. So you just continue by
living and trying to do the right thing for all situations.
>Craig, how has inﬂation with suppliers aﬀected pricing?
{BIO 1505432 <GO>}
When you say how inﬂation is aﬀected pricing, it's increased pricing. I think if you
read what's happened to inﬂation over the last year, prices started to increase. Now
if you look at what gasoline prices are now compared to where they are a year ago,
you'll start to see some prices start to drop. And our goal at Costco is to continue to
ﬁgure out how we lower prices and that's working with our suppliers to in fact, lower
the cost of goods.
Does Costco have any speciﬁc plans to beat out BJ's or potentially aﬃliate with or
purchase BJ's?
{BIO 1505432 <GO>}
No, we have no plans at this moment to do anything such thing. But we will compete
with them.
Does Costco intend on increasing revenue from online sales? If so, how would it go
about this?
{BIO 1505432 <GO>}
Well, normally when we do increase sales we would hope to see an improvement in
proﬁts. Now I think what you see that's happening speciﬁcally in our realm of
business you see more start to come back to the brick and mortar. But we will
continue to look to increase our digital footprint in our digital sales in all countries
where we do business. Well, thank you everyone for your attendance. This concludes
our meeting. For relevant questions that could not be answered due to the time
constraints, we'll provide prompt responses on the Investor Relations section of our
website with similar questions grouped together and responded to you collectively.
