Welcome to the Amazon.com Annual Meeting of Shareholders. I'm David Zapolsky,
Secretary and General Counsel. I now call the formal portion of this meeting to
order. This is our 23rd Annual Meeting since we became a public company. We are
conducting this Annual Meeting virtually this year. So our shareholders can
participate from any geographic location with Internet connectivity. We believe this is
an important step to enhancing accessibility to our Annual Meeting for all of our
shareholders and reducing the carbon footprint of our activities.
It is particularly important for our shareholders, employees and community this year
in light of public health and safety considerations posed by COVID-19. Thank you to
our shareholders who have joined us virtually today. We know these are diﬃcult
times for many people around the world. And our thoughts go out to those who
have been most aﬀected by COVID-19. You will hear more later today about what we
are doing for our employees, customers and communities to respond to the
challenges presented by COVID-19.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Myaisha Hayesminutes, we will need to place the line on mute, so that we can continue the
meeting. Thank you in advance for your understanding.
Rabbi Joshua Ratner will now introduce Proposal Number Five, requesting a report
on the eﬀects of food waste. Rabbi Ratner has pre recorded the following
statements.
My fellow Amazon.com shareholders, my name is Rabbi Josh Ratner. On behalf of
JLens, the lead ﬁler of Proposal Number Five and ﬁrst aﬃrmative, our co-ﬁler, I urge
you to vote for our proposal calling for Amazon to address its massive food waste
problem. Amazon has refused to take any steps to disclose either it's total food
waste or comprehensive steps it is taking to reduce this waste. While the societal risk
to climate change and hunger from Amazon's food waste problem was already acute
when we ﬁled this proposal, the need for Amazon to take action is all the more
urgent today in the wake of COVID-19 when all major players within the food
ecosystem should evaluate their policies and practices in light of their many fault
lines that have been revealed in our food supply chain because of the Coronavirus.
Our proposal makes the following request, resolved, shareholders request that
Amazon.com, Inc. issue an Annual Report at reasonable cost and leaving proprietary
information on the environmental and social impacts of food waste generated from
the company's operations, given the signiﬁcant impact that food waste has on
societal risk from climate change and hunger.
Enhanced disclosure by Amazon.com of both its food waste footprint and its eﬀorts
to minimize the social and environmental consequences of food waste would enable
shareholders to evaluate how the company is managing related ﬁnancial,
operational, regulatory and societal risks. Such disclosures could also help Amazon
identify cost savings opportunities, enhance its reputation and at a minimum
compete eﬀectively with its peers and demonstrating action on this critical social and
environmental issue.
We believe that Amazon should be a leader, not a laggard when it comes to food
waste. We urge you to vote for Proposal Number Five.

Laura Camposcommission an independent third-party report on Amazon's process for customer
due diligence. This report would determine whether customers use of surveillance
products and services contributes to human rights violations. MediaJustice is a
national organization that ﬁghts for racial, gender and economic justice in the digital
age. We're also the home of the MediaJustice network and network of 103
organizations based across the country, working on the front lines of social change.
As millions of people shelter in place during this pandemic, Amazon has become a
trusted tool to deliver the vital supplies our communities need to stay safe.
Yet, Amazon is undermining that trust with the sale of surveillance products and
services that and the safety of our communities and fast tracks discrimination.
Amazon surveillance products enabled widespread, unchecked surveillance by our
neighbors, employers and government agencies. This technology can be used it in I-
communities, access to health care, housing or even employment opportunities.
Amazon surveillance products create an imbalance of power in our everyday lives,
when customers can share their footage with third parties including law
enforcement, who are free to use to and share their footage as they please. Full year
records obtained by the ACE expose that ACE already sources information from
local law enforcement for the purposes of deportation, suddenly walking, pass your
neighbors points can become evidence in the deportation case.
Furthermore, research from MIT has shown that Amazon's facial recognition
technology use far more likely to miss identify women and people of color
compared to white men, layered on top of our buyers criminal legal system this
technology automate the racial proﬁling that leads to more people of color being
arrested, injured and or killed by the police.
Given the potential risk, Amazon is absolutely responsible for how its customers use
their surveillance products and therefore should be obligated to mitigate the harm
caused by its products. I (inaudible) strongly encouraging all shareholders to vote in
favor of item six, calling for increased oversight of customers use of Amazon's high
risk tech products and services.

Good morning. I'm Laura Campos and I'm here on behalf of The Nathan Cummings
Foundation to move Proposal Eight. The proposal ask Amazon report on its eﬀorts to
address hate speech and the sale of oﬀensive products. We recognize that Amazon
has a number of policies, governing the sale of oﬀensive and controversial products.
We have questions however about Amazon's process for enforcing these policies.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Brandon ReeseTwo years ago, a report from the partnership for working families and the actions on
our race on the economy observe that Amazon has been reactive, not proactive in its
response to the use of it's site by pedalers of hate. We're concerned that this
continues to be the case.
Internet searches return multiple headlines on this topic. For instance, in late
February, FORCE ran an article with the headline, Amazon Pulls Nazi Children's Book
From Its Website As It Struggles With Hate Speech. The author of that article noted
that while the book had been pulled, (inaudible) white Supremacist-themed coﬀee
mugs, shot glasses and hoodies for sale on Amazon.
In December, the HuﬀPost noted the Amazon pulled Holocaust-themed Christmas
ornaments, bottle openers and key chains after a public outcry. Unfortunately, these
are not the only examples, as the foundation working to build a more democratic
and racially just society, the Nathan Cummings Foundation ﬁnds the apparent gap
between Amazon's policy and practice to be extremely disconcerting, particularly
given that hate crimes appear to be on the rise, what's more as a long-term investor
were concerned that a gap between Amazon's policies and practice could expose
the company to reputational damage, boycotts and ﬁnes, while negatively impacting
employee morale and damaging other important stakeholder relationships. We're
not alone here, last year this proposal was supported by investors holding more than
$220 billion of Amazon stock based on yesterday's share price. We urge the Board
to listen to concerned long-term investors and take steps to implement our
proposal. Thank you.

Thank you. Brandon Reese will now introduce Proposal Number Nine, requesting
Mandatory Independent Board Share Policy. Operator, please open the line for Mr.
Reese.
Good morning. My name is Brandon Reese and I hereby present our shareholder
proposal on behalf of the AFL-CIO. First, I want to express my best wishes for the
health and safety of all Amazon employees and their families during these diﬃcult
times. Second, I want to express heartfelt thanks to the essential front line Amazon
employees, who've been putting their lives on the line to deliver needed food and
household supplies to ﬁll many of us who are subject to stay at home orders.
Amazon needs independent Board leadership more than ever. The business
challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic require the full and undivided
attention of Amazon's CEO, without the distraction of serving as Board Chair. Our
proposal urges the Board of Directors to adopt a policy to require that the Chair of
the Board shall be an independent director, who has not previously served as an
Executive Oﬃcer of the Company. In our view, Independent Board Leadership is a
crucial foundation of good corporate governance.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Page 6 of 24David Zapolsky
Unidentiﬁed SpeakerWe welcome and encourage Amazon's eﬀorts to implement health and safety
standards to protect its workforce from the risk of COVID-19. However, we know
reports that Amazon has stopped disclosing the number of COVID-19 cases among
workers in its facilities that Amazon employees have been afraid to come to work
and that hundreds of workers have been infected with COVID-19.
Oversight of Human Capital Management is a fundamental board responsibility in
normal times. It is absolutely critical when workers and the customers they serve face
a deadly disease. It is incumbent upon the Independent Board members to disclose
the goal that the Board has set for operating safely during the pandemic and the
metrics that it is using to measure progress towards those goals. We need
independent leadership to hold management accountable for the success of the
Company's eﬀorts to keep its workforce and customers safe. We believe an
Independent Board Chair will enhance management accountability at Amazon and
we therefore urge Amazon to join the majority of S&P 500 companies, who have
now split the positions of Chair and CEO. Thank you.

Thank you. Natasha Lam will now introduce Proposal Number 10 requesting an
alternative report on gender and racial pay. Ms. Lam has pre recorded the following
statements.
Good morning. My name is Natasha Lam [ph] and I move Proposal Number 10, on
behalf of Argenta Capital, asking for a report on gender and racial pay equity. On its
face, Amazon is taking an important ﬁrst step by publishing statistically adjusted pay
parity numbers, assessing the pay of men and women and minorities and non-
minorities performing similar jobs. And while we are proud to have worked with the
company to make that data public, it's only half the story. The other half is Median
pay disclosure. Pay gaps are comprised of two parts, equal pay for your current job
versus peers and equal opportunity to high paying jobs.
Median pay gaps reﬂect a lack of equal opportunity by measuring whether women
and minorities are holding as many high paying jobs. The gender pay gap is literally
deﬁned as the median pay of women working full-time compared to the median pay
of man. And Median pay gaps are considered the valid way of measuring pay and
equity by the US Census Bureau and the Department of Labor among others. For the
Board to suggest the measure is inaccurate or alternative is misleading and a
disservice to the Group's these pay gaps eﬀect.
We can see Amazon's pay gaps in the United Kingdom because they are mandated,
but our company has not published median information beyond the UK. Yet
companies like Citigroup, Mastercard and Starbucks are already showing leadership
by publishing their median pay gap data globally. These disclosures can improve
performance and provide a baseline for measuring future progress. There are many
ways to shrink gender and racial pay gaps at a company, improving diversity,
ensuring statistically adjusted pay parity, advancing women and minorities intoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Thank you. Maren Costa will now introduce Proposal Number 11, requesting a report
on certain community impacts. Ms. Costa has pre recorded the following statement.
I'm Maren Costa, on behalf of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice. Jeﬀ, I worked
for you for 15 years, but I and eight others were recently ﬁred and VP Tim Bray
resigned citing a Vein of Toxicity that runs through the Company. This toxicity
showed up in senior leadership meeting with racist comments and a plan to smear
Chris Malls [ph]. Toxicity is embedded in our operations as pollution causes stunted
lung development, asthma and higher death rates from COVID-19 concentrated in
Black & Brown communities. This is environmental racism. We want zero emissions
by 2030, while investing ﬁrst in the communities most impacted. We want racial
equity assessments and community beneﬁts agreements to be mandatory. Let's hear
from a family in San Bernardino, California, Amazon's Western Hub, where air
pollution is already the worst in the nation.
Hello. My name is Amy and I'm (inaudible), we live in San Bernardino with my Mom,
who is in Amazon warehouse. The virus as is staying out to make sure my mom gets
home safe from work. We have to wait an hour washing disinfected clothes, shoes,
washes herself and changes in to new clothes. It's hard to seeing her like this, but I
know she is doing it to protect it. We have asthma, a lot of our friends have asthma,
it's normal here. We have to run with our inhalers. We have always been more at risk
due to the pollution. Amazon has so many warehouses and trucks use, they want to
keep going and take of airport, doing what they always do coming in without any
beneﬁts to the community. We know Amazon comes in neighborhoods like ours,
where a lot of families speak Spanish or brown and black to put their permission.
You can't say you are ﬁghting climate change if you keep ruining our communities.
We want people to know that Amazon is not safe. Amazon trucks and warehouses
are aﬀecting a lot of people. My mom is not replacable, her life is worth more than $2
raise. Our communities are not replacable. We need to be able to be. My mom and
other families are sacriﬁcing so much Amazon can give us good jobs and clean air.
Jeﬀ, will you continue to disproportionately pollute black and brown communities or
will you stand with us and with our central coworkers and adopt our resolution?

Unidentiﬁed SpeakerThank you. Justin Danhof will now introduce Proposal Number 12, requesting a
report on viewpoint discrimination. Mr. Danhof has pre-recorded the following
statement.
I'm Justin Danhof of the National Center for Public Policy Research and I move
Proposal 12, which questions Amazon's reliance on the discredited Southern Poverty
Law Center as the gatekeeper of the AmazonSmile Charitable Program. The SPLC is
a bigoted organization whose own staﬀers have also accused of racism, sexism. Yet
Amazon allows the SPLC to pick and choose which charities are eligible for the Smile
program, why? The extreme left is at the SPLC use this power to exclude groups that
it disagrees with ideologically, well it in turn reef tremendous windfall from the Smile
program. This is wildly hypocritical. We suggest the IRS investigate this corrupt
arrangement and clear conﬂict of interest.
In the meantime, shareholders should demand Amazon end this scheme. The SPLC
is known mostly for publishing an annual hate map, listing America's supposed hate
groups. This cynical yearly exercise is little more than a public listing of SPLC's
political enemies. How else can one explain the SPLC categorizing groups such as
the alliance defending freedom alongside the Ku Klux Klan.
ADF is one of the nation's preeminent legal advocates for religious liberty which has
scored 10 victories at the United States Supreme Court since 2011. Everyone knows
that Klan is a hate group, what the SPLC is trying to do is convince naive Americans,
their conservative and religious organizations are morally equivalent to the KKK.
In 2014, the FBI removed the SPLC as a source citing a number of concerns. Last year
even the far left leadership of Twitter dumped the SPLC from its trust and safety
council after many of the Group's scandals were exposed. Some of the scandals
were exposed by Mr. Bezos owned radically liberal newspaper, The Washington Post,
which ran headlines such as the Southern Poverty Law Center has lost all credibility
and something strange is going on at the civil rights institution, it must be
investigated, which called for a federal probe into the SPLC.
Last year, a former SPLC staﬀ or even wrote in The New Yorker, that SPLC Co-
Founder Morris Dees quote, viewed civil rights work mainly as a marketing tool for
bilking gullible Northern liberals. Amazon's leadership may be that gullible, but let's
show that we investors are not. Please join me in voting in favor of Proposal Number
12.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 9 of 24David ZapolskyI want to become a manager, but when I look at the work charts, I don't see a lot of
women in management positions. It makes me wonder how far can I actually go?
Almost everyone on my team is male, most days I don't even notice.
I was once a witness to a conversation between a long-tenured woman and a
recently hired man. The last reform was completely acceptable to say, of course, men
get promoted more than women, men work longer hours.
I was told that I'm already operating at the next level in terms of the technical bar
required. But the only thing holding my promotion back is that I'm too quiet and the
process needs me to be more outspoken and sort of. While my manager
acknowledged that the system was broken, I did not see any eﬀorts to change this
broken system. And after giving three years of what I could, I decided to leave the
team.
That concerns me as an employee that so much important decision making happens
without adequate representation.
In my time at Amazon, I have changed teams because my leadership took no actions
to make sure that our work environment was professional one. White men faced no
consequences for their unprofessional behavior. The same men are asked to be on
the diversity and inclusion committees, these experiences have stalled my career
and cost me tremendous stress and anxiety.
If we cannot retain female talent, if we cannot retain people of color talent, then we
still have a problem. I don't think that we can thrive and create innovative products
and successful technology if only a subset of voices matter.
My promo doc was blocked from being written by my Skip-Level manager who took
me aside and asked me why do you think you are ready for a promo, you just spend
some time getting a boyfriend or having fun.
These stories are common experience they are happening at every level in Amazon
and across the tech industry. Sexism and racism hurts those who experience it, our
recruitment and retention, as well as our public image and proﬁt margins. I urge you
to support the report and promotion velocity. This way you can assess the true risks
to Amazon and its employees.

proposal is set forth in full in the proxy statement, but I would point out that we take
all accusations of discrimination seriously and they have no place at Amazon or any

discrimination to discuss this with their HR business partner, place a call to the

proposal requests the Board to give shareholders with an aggregate of 20% net
long of outstanding shares, the power to call a special shareholder meeting, instead
of the current requirement of 30%. In response to my proposal, the Board seeks to
reduce the threshold from 30% to 25% in Proposal Number Four. Unfortunately that
threshold will still be among the highest levels required by companies with such
provision, especially considering the size of Amazon.
Many companies have threshold as low as 10%, getting 30% of the shareholders go

Thank you so much. Good morning, my name is Sarah Zoen and on behalf of Oxfam
America & Co ﬁlers, I'm happy to move item number 15, which request Amazon to
conduct at least once Human Rights Impact Assessment or HRIA in a high-risk sector.
The use of Human Rights Impact Assessment to identify existing and potential
adverse impacts on communities or workers is a vital tool because it enables the
company to protect itself from costly reputational and operational risks lurking in
Amazon's own operations and across the activities in its supply chain.
Human rights abuses in the supply chain cause real harm to company by damaging
brands, undermining reputational value and disrupting the supply chain. From daily
global headlines over worker concerns and worker walkouts during the COVID crisis
to the collapse of Amazon HQ2 plan, all of this shows the tangible impact of
negative stakeholder views regarding Amazon's record on labor and human rights.

Yes, thank you. Thank you and good morning, saving the best for last time, I'm Bruce
Herbert of Newground Social Investment in Seattle and I stand to move Proposal
Number 16, which seeks greater transparency in Amazon's lobbying. But before I do,
let me speak directly to the employees and management of Amazon. I hope you
each and all of them you care about are well safe and perhaps ﬁnd a unique ways to
thrive during these unprecedented times.
Turning to the lobbying, though Amazon make certain disclosures, they are not gross
ﬁgures, they are not detailed and they are inadequate for assessing risk. Over a
three-year period for instance, Amazon spent $48.2 million on federal lobbying, but
this does not include state lobbying where disclosures uneven or entirely absent.
Amazon sales they disclose belonging to the Business Roundtable, the BRT which
spent $23.2 million lobbying in 2018. Amazon signed the BRT statement on the
purpose of the corporation, yet BRT lobbies to limit the essential ownership right of
stockholders to ﬁle shareholder proposals like this one. Lack of disclosure can
present serious reputational risk when it contradicts Amazon's public positions.
For example, Amazon joined We Are Still in campaign, launched after President
Trump dropped out of the Paris Climate Agreement, but Amazon donated $15,000
to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which disputes climate change science.
Amazon co-founded the climate pledge, announcing a commitment to meet the
Paris Agreement 10 years early, yet is a member of the US Chamber of Commerce,
which has spent over $1.5 billion lobbying since 1998, working to undermine the Paris
Climate and accord.

{BIO 19345099 <GO>}
Good morning. I'm Michael Connor, Executive Director of Open MIC, a non-proﬁt
that works to foster corporate accountability in the tech sector. I'm here on behalf of
Harrington Investments to move Proposal Number Seven, which seeks an
independent study of recognition and the extent to which this facial recognition
technology threatens privacy or civil rights and disproportionately impacts people of
color, immigrants and activists in the United States and worldwide.
We believe the Company's Management and Board have failed to exercise ﬁduciary
oversight by inadequately assessing the risk posed by recognition. For example,
researchers at MIT have found that recognition demonstrates gender and racial bias
and is far more likely to miss identify women and people with dark skin than white
men. While the Company disputes that research, as of December, it had not
submitted its algorithm for independent testing by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, while peer companies like Microsoft have done so.
Many experts and lawmakers have questioned whether the technology should be
used at all, even if it is 100% accurate. The company has acknowledged that it does
not audit recognition customers, giving it little insight into the risks posed by use of
the product. In a recent PBS documentary, AWS, CEO Andy Jassy said, "I don't think
we know the total number of police departments that are using facial recognition
technology. Recognition could exacerbate existing systemic racial injustice as people
of color, incorrectly identiﬁed as violent criminals would be at greater risk of police
violence during a pursuit or arrest". A number of US municipalities and states have
banned government use of facial recognition, it's diﬃcult to reconcile the
Company's support for regulation and acknowledgment of the potential negative
impacts of the technology, with its willingness to risk these impacts by selling
recognition in an unregulated environment. Trust is fundamental to Amazon's brand
and business, the company must do more to assess the risks of its recognition
technology. We urge you to vote for Proposal Number Seven.

Thank you. The proxy statement for this meeting explains the reasons for the

I would now like to introduce Brian Olsavsky, who will give a ﬁnancial update.
{BIO 18872363 <GO>}
Good morning, everyone. I'm Brian Olsavsky, the company's Chief Financial Oﬃcer.
I'll be giving you a recap of our 2019 ﬁnancial results and business highlights, which
will be followed by presentations from Jay Carney, our Senior Vice President of
Global Corporate Aﬀairs and Kara Hurst, our Vice President of Worldwide
Sustainability. Jay will provide an update on our eﬀorts in response to the COVID-19
crisis and Kara will give an update on our sustainability programs. This will be
followed by an investor Q&A with our CEO, Jeﬀ Bezos.
I knew that 2019 we feel like a long time ago, given how much has changed for all of
us over the past few months. However, since this is our annual meeting, I'd like to
spend the next few minutes discussing our results from last year. First and foremost,
I'd like to thank our customers for a great year in 2019. This includes more than 150
million prime members around the world, as well as our third party sellers who
represent more than half of all units sold on Amazon.
It also includes millions of AWS developers and enterprises of all sizes, including
start-ups, government agencies and academic institutions. And special thank you to
our dedicated employees, who worked tirelessly on behalf of our customers each
and every day.
Let's ﬁrst talk about our results for 2019. Sales were $281 billion, which is up 20%
year-over-year or 22% excluding foreign exchange. This growth is a measure of how
well we are doing with customers and reﬂects the output of the key principles that
guide our business. Customer obsession rather than competitor focus, a passion for
invention, our commitment to operational excellence and long-term thinking. We
continue to see strong customer acquisition and engagement across our businesses
and we are seeing steady growth in all three of our segments.
North America revenues grew to $171 billion, up 21% year-over-year. International
revenue grew to $75 billion, up 17% year-over-year excluding foreign exchange. And
AWS grew revenues to $35 billion, up 37% year-over-year. In 2019, operating income
was $15 billion, up 17% year-over-year or 16% year-over-year excluding foreign
exchange. Operating margin for 2019 was 5.2% compared to 5.3% in 2018. So even
as we see strong sales growth, we continue to re-invest meaningfully in 2019 across
our businesses to build better experiences for our customers. I'll touch on several of
these investment initiatives a bit later in the presentation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 14 of 24Cash ﬂows are most important ﬁnancial output metric. Let's ﬁrst look at operating
cash ﬂow, which represents cash generated by the businesses before factoring in
reinvestments. For 2019, operating cash ﬂow was $39 billion, up 25% year-over-year.
This number is a result of strong top line growth in proﬁtability and good working
capital eﬃciency.
Free cash ﬂows are what remain after we invest in capital expenditures. We have
three cash ﬂow measures and I will focus on the -- our most conservative measure,
which is free cash ﬂow after taking into account our cash CapEx, equipment acquired
under ﬁnanced leases and principal repayments of ﬁnancing obligations. For a
reconciliation of our free cash ﬂow to GAAP, see our annual reports ﬁled on Form 10-
K. 2019 our free cash ﬂow was $12 billion, up 48% year-over-year. We are investing to
generate long-term, free cash ﬂow and a healthy return on this invested capital.
We see strong operating income and free cash ﬂow as a sign that these investments
are working. And now I'll brieﬂy touch on a few areas of investment. Our prime
program remains core to what we do. There are now more than 150 million paid
Prime members around the world and we continue to invest heavily to bring even
more value to our Prime program. In Q2 of last year, we underwent a big transition to
one day delivery in the United States. We invested billions of dollars in 2019 to
expand our selection at these faster speeds, while also seeing a great response from
customers. Prime members love the faster shipping speeds and shop more often as
a result.
In addition to one-day delivery, we invested to make ultra fast grocery delivery even
better for customers. Amazon Fresh is now free for Prime members, with improved
delivery speeds oﬀering one, two hour delivery options. We also made grocery
shopping from Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market available to more Prime
members, with grocery delivery now available in more than 2,000 cities and towns in
the United States.
Prime Video continues to get better. Prime members have access to thousands of
movies and TV shows with Prime Video including Amazon originals. Last year, our
Amazon originals received 88 nominations from major award shows and had 26
wins. Amazon Music continues to be popular with customers and we now have over
55 million customers enjoying our music service around the world.
With Amazon Music, Prime members enjoy access to 2 million songs, ad free
including thousands of stations in playlists. Prime is now available in 19 countries and
it beneﬁts both customers and our third-party sellers. These 3P sellers mostly
comprise of small and medium-size businesses. 3P sellers are an important part of
our ability to continue to grow selection for our customers and represent more than
half of all of our units sold on Amazon.
We continue to invest in our sellers to help them succeed. In 2019, we invested more
than $15 billion in infrastructure programs, people and added 225 new tools and
services to help our sellers grow their brands and businesses. In addition, weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 15 of 24Jay Carneyinvested billions more to expand one-day delivery to millions of products, oﬀered by
fulﬁllment by Amazon sellers and these investments are working. Sellers around the
world are seeing success.
Last year more than 15,000 small and medium-size businesses selling in Amazon
stores in the US surpassed $1 million in sales. And FBA sellers sold hundreds of
millions of items that shipped with one-day delivery or faster in 2019. We continue to
be inspired by the type of courage and inventedness that makes entrepreneurs and
small businesses successful. And our customers beneﬁt from the products, content
and skills they produce. We salute these millions of entrepreneurs, creators and
developers around the world. With Alexa, our goal is to make customers' lives easier
and more convenient both at home and on the go.
Customers have purchased hundreds of millions of Alexa enabled devices around
the world. These include our own devices like Amazon Echo, Fire TV and Fire Tablets.
Alexa continues to get smarter and make customers' lives easier. As people are
ﬁnding themselves more at home right now, customers are engaging even more
with Alexa. They're listening to more music, they're asking more questions,
particularly around educational topics like math and Grammer and they're asking for
more cooking related advice like recipe ideas or measurement conversions. We're
also seeing more engagement with Alexa calling and drop in to help people stay
more connected with family and friends.
And now shifting to AWS. AWS ﬁnished 2019 as nearly a $40 billion run rate business
and it continues to grow. We continue to drive strong growth in enterprises and with
our start-up in digital native customers and are investing to support their growth. We
remain focused on growing our geographic footprint. Currently, we oﬀer 76
availability zones across 24 geographic regions. And we've announced nine more
availability zones in three more regions in Indonesia, Japan and Spain. We're also
continuing to invest in our sales and marketing teams to support enterprise
customer growth in adoption and rapidly expand our regional presence.
Today, there is a tremendous breadth of functionality that exist in AWS and our
customers continue to request additional functionality, so they can move the rest of
their apps to the cloud and continue building anything their developers can
imagine. We continue to add new capabilities and services at an accelerating pace
to meet and anticipate customer needs. You can expect us to continue to innovate
and invest in areas such as machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence, analytics,
Internet of Things and the edge, serverless computing, containers, compute
databases, storage and global expansion. Let me close by once again thanking our
customers around the world for your continued business and support.
And now I'd like to introduce Jay Carney.

Page 16 of 24response to the COVID-19 crisis. Although, these are incredibly diﬃcult times, they
are an important reminder that what we do as a company can make a big diﬀerence
in people's lives. Customers count on us to be there and we're fortunate to be able
to help. With our scale and ability to innovate quickly, Amazon can have a positive
impact and be an organizing force for progress in the COVID-19 crisis and beyond.
I'd now like to play a short video.
(video presentation)
Nothing is more important than the health and well-being of our teams, which is why
we're investing signiﬁcantly to help keep them safe and recognize their
contributions. We expect to invest approximately $4 billion on COVID related
initiatives by June. In terms of safety, we've made more than 150 process changes
within our operations network and Whole Foods Market Stores, that includes social
distancing, additional cleaning measures, procuring 100 million face masks,
purchasing a thousand thermal cameras and 31,000 thermometers to conduct
temperature checks, staggering start times, changing the way meetings happen and
much more.
In terms of recognizing employee contributions, starting in March, we increased pay
for hourly employees by $2 an hour in the US and Canada, GBP2 an hour in the UK
and EUR2 an hour in many European countries. We also doubled the regular hourly
base pay for overtime hours worked to a minimum of $34 an hour in the US and
that's just the start.
We've also launched eﬀorts toward developing our own testing capacity. Our goal is
to do everything we can that's eﬀective to help our employees. One thing we've
learned from the COVID-19 crisis is how important Amazon has become to our
customers and we take that responsibility seriously. We are improving delivery
speeds across our store, while continuing to adhere to extensive health and safety
measures to protect our associates, as they pick pack and ship products to
customers.
We've hired a 175,000 people in our fulﬁllment and delivery network in response to
the increased demand. To protect the safety of all Whole Foods Market customers
nationwide, we're performing enhanced cleaning, distributing free face masks to
customers and reserving the ﬁrst hour of grocery pick up for seniors and other high-
risk customers.
And our Amazon and Alexa devices help customers all over the world stay
connected and informed. We're also committed to supporting communities through
this crisis. Amazon is donating millions of dollars and ﬁnancial support and products
to assist organizations and individuals who are aﬀected and I'll share a few examples.
We're doing a number of things to ensure access to food including working with
food banks in 25 cities across the US to deliver 6 million meals to vulnerable
populations and with the Seattle catering company to distribute more than 73,000
meals to elderly and medically vulnerable residents.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 17 of 24Kara HurstIn addition, Amazon, CEO and founder Jeﬀ Bezos personally donated $100 million to
feeding America. As another example, we're donating $5 million in Amazon devices
to health care workers, patients, schools, teachers and communities around the
globe, as well as 12,200 laptops to students across the US. We're also making online
computer science resources available at no cost to students, parents and teachers
through Amazon Future Engineer.
AWS is also playing an important role in this crisis, providing a centralized repository
of datasets, focused on the spread and characteristics of the virus. The AWS COVID-
19 data lake which includes datasets from Johns Hopkins University, Deﬁnitive
Healthcare, Carnegie Mellon's Delphi Research Group and other sources is available
for anyone working on solutions to combat COVID-19. We all recognize that COVID-
19 is an opportunity for us to rise to the challenge and Amazon's board and board
committees have been actively involved in our COVID-19 response. I'm proud to
share just some of what we're doing to support employees, customers and
communities through this diﬃcult time.
With that, I'll turn it over to my colleague Kara Hurst.
{BIO 21939255 <GO>}
Hello and thank you for joining us today. My name is Kara Hurst and I am the Vice
President of Worldwide Sustainability at Amazon. As Jay just said, these are
incredibly diﬃcult times, but they are also an important reminder that what we do as
a company can make a big diﬀerence. That's why we're taking urgent action in using
our scale and ability to innovate quickly to slow the eﬀects of climate change and
protect the planet.
Climate change is outpacing the worst scientiﬁc projections, oceans are warming
40% faster than predicted, Antarctic ice sheets are melting 70% faster than
predicted. Given these projections, we decided we wanted to use our scale for good
and not only reduce our own carbon emissions, but also encourage others to pledge
to do the same.
Last September we co-founded and became the ﬁrst signatory of the Climate
pledge in partnership with Christiana Figueres, the UN's former climate change
Chief and Founder of Global Optimism. The pledge commits Amazon to meet the
goals of the Paris Agreement 10 years early, to be net zero carbon by 2040.
Signatories to kind of pledge commit to three things, ﬁrst to measure and report
greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis, second to implement decarbonization
strategies in line with the Paris Agreement through real business changes and
innovations.
Third, to commit to neutralize any remaining emissions with additional quantiﬁable,
real permanent and socially beneﬁcial oﬀsets to achieve net zero carbon by 2040.
These investments are good for the environment, but the promise is even greater.
When businesses sign the pledge, they send an important signal to the market place
to start inventing and developing new technologies that large global companiesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 18 of 24need to transition to a low-carbon economy. We will be announcing additional
signatory soon.
As part of our commitments, we've been working for several years now to map and
measure Amazon's environmental and social impacts. We're a complex business and
face signiﬁcant challenges in achieving our goals. We don't just move information
around, we have extensive physical infrastructure that delivers more than 10 billion
items worldwide a year.
We operate in a range of sectors from retail, entertainment and devices to cloud
computing. Operating in many diﬀerent ﬁelds introduces challenge and constraints
that drive innovation. And we believe if Amazon can get to net zero carbon 10 years
early, any company can. We want to work together with all companies to make this a
reality.
We are investing in a range of initiatives to achieve the pledge. We plan to power
our operations using 100% renewable energy by 2030 and 80% by 2024. The team
is actually pushing to get it to a 100% by 2025 and has a challenging and credible
plan to pull that oﬀ. Globally, Amazon is investing heavily in renewable energy
projects including utility scale, wind and solar farms and solar rooftops, enough to
power over 0.5 million US homes. We've purchased 100,000 electric delivery vans
from Rivian, a US based electric vehicle manufacturer. Amazon aims to have 10,000
of Rivian's new electric vans on the road as early as 2022 and all 100,000 vehicles on
the road by 2030.
In partnership with The Nature Conservancy, we're investing $100 million to the Right
Now Climate Fund in nature based Climate Solutions and reforestation projects to
begin removing carbon from the atmosphere now. Another action we're taking is
cutting packaging waste. Since 2015, we've reduced the weight of outbound
packaging by 25% and eliminated over 810,000 tons of packaging material, the
equivalent of about 1.4 billion shipping boxes through programs like Frustration-Free
Packaging.
We're also investing $10 million in the Closed Loop Fund to help ensure certain
materials go back into the manufacturing supply chain. Over the next decade,
Amazon's Investment is expected to increase the availability of curbside recycling for
3 million homes in United States. We have a global team using a science-based
approach to develop data and strategies to ensure rigor in all of our sustainability
work and our team is always growing.
We also have more than 4,500 Amazon sustainability ambassadors around the
world, making a positive change across our operations and in the communities
where we operate. While we are investing to achieve net zero carbon by 2040, our
core businesses of online shopping and cloud computing are both already
inherently more carbon eﬃcient.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 19 of 24Shelly Kay Pfeiﬀer
Jeﬀ BezosOur analysis has found that shopping online consistently generates less carbon than
driving to a store, since a single delivery van trip can eliminate about 100 round trip
car journeys on average. Our scientists also developed a model to compare the
carbon intensity of ordering Whole Foods Market groceries online versus driving to
your nearest store. The study found that average across all basket sizes, online
grocery deliveries generate 43% lower carbon emissions per item compared to
shopping in stores.
And smaller basket sizes generate greater carbon savings. Additionally AWS is also
inherently more eﬃcient and has a lower carbon footprint than traditional in-house
data centers. A study by 451 Research found that AWS' infrastructure is 3.6 times
more energy eﬃcient than the median US enterprise data center surveyed. Along
with our use of renewable energy, these factors enable AWS to do the same tasks as
traditional data centers with an 88% lower carbon footprint.
Thank you for the opportunity to share how Amazon is using its scale for good. We
look forward to continuing to keep you updated on our progress. And with that, I'll
turn it over to our moderator, Shelly Kay Pfeiﬀer for Q&A.
Thanks, Kara. I would now like to introduce Jeﬀ Bezos, who will address questions we
have received pursuant to the meeting rules of conduct.
{BIO 1642252 <GO>}
Hello. I'd like to thank -- thank all of you for taking the time to join us this morning.
Before we move into the Q&A portion of today's event, just want to take a moment
to say thank you to my fellow Amazonians and all of our partners, particularly those
in our operations in delivery network and physical stores, who continue to do their
part to bring necessary items to Amazon's customers. For those most vulnerable to
the virus, having products delivered to their front steps is more than a simple
convenience, it is a lifeline.
I'd also like to welcome the 175,000 new employees who've joined us in the past few
months to help us meet increasing customer demand. I'm deeply grateful to each of
you for the important work you're doing for customers. As you've heard here,
nothing is more important than the health and well-being of our employees. We've
made investments in protective equipment, enhance our cleaning of our facilities,
introduce new process paths that allow for much more eﬀective social distancing,
we've raised wages for hourly teams and hundreds of millions invested to develop
our own COVID-19 testing capabilities.
And as Jay mentioned, we expect to spend about $4 billion on COVID related
expenses by the end of June. I want to also express my gratitude to everyone around
the globe doing their part to help us deal with the COVID-19 outbreak, that includes
hospital workers, ﬁrst responders and the millions of people across the country and
around the world keeping our food supplies robust and safe. And the researchersFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

remain challenges ahead, but I am very optimistic that we as a society will meet them
and we'll take important lessons from this pandemic that will make us stronger.
Okay. With that I'd like to take your questions.
Questions And Answers
Thanks, Jeﬀ. We'll now move to our ﬁrst question. As Amazon gets bigger, it's
getting a lot more scrutiny. Do you think that scrutiny could hurt your reputation --
reputation with customers?
{BIO 1642252 <GO>}
No. I think scrutiny will enhance our reputation with customers. We are very fortunate
to have over the last couple of decades become signiﬁcant and an important
company. And with that, of course, it's completely normal that we be scrutinized.
And we want people to know the truth about Amazon and how we use our scale for
good and how we work hard and we will work hard to explain that.
We've created more jobs than any other company in the past decade, jobs with $15
minimum wage, great beneﬁts in a safe working environment. We support millions of
small businesses who sell through Amazon and we are working to protect erst
climate with initiatives such as the climate pledge that you heard about from Kara.
We're investing in communities through initiatives like Amazon Future Engineer, the
computer science programs and the Mary's Place homeless shelter like the one we
just opened in our Seattle headquarters.
I'm extremely proud of what we do for customers, what we do for employees and
what we do for the communities that we serve. And we welcome the scrutiny, it's
good for us.
How do you think Amazon senior leadership and the Board have done in addressing
the health and safety threats posed by Coronavirus to your employees?
{BIO 1642252 <GO>}
I think they've done a remarkable job in a diﬃcult situation. This is an area I've spent
a lot of time personally over the past months, working closely with the senior team.
We've been discussing these issues regularly with the Amazon Board and with Board
committees, outside of our typical meeting cycles. In fact, we've been having weekly
phone calls on this topic with the Board. The Board is super engaged in this
response.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

A - Jeﬀ BezosMay be, probably clear, our employees and keeping our employees safe, there is
nothing more important than that and I'm proud of the job the team has done there.
We've taken it seriously from the very beginning, we were -- we're the ﬁrst
companies to begin remote work. We've implemented temperature checks, we've
distributed 100 million masks, 34 million gloves, 31,000 thermometers in our FCs
and over 1,000 thermal cameras to help with the temperature checks.
We've reworked our fulﬁllment processes, even when reworking that process made
it less eﬃcient, so that we could keep people socially distance. We've done a good
job work on contact tracing, isolating people and we're in the process of building
our own testing laboratories, so that we can test our front-line people. I think it's also
really important to stay humble during all of this, we are learning all the time. I'm
proud of what we've done, but we have to keep in mind that the more we learn the
better we'll be able to do, we'll just keep our heads down, we'll keep improving and
you can absolutely count on us to do that.
There are reports that you ﬁred employees who were speaking out about their
working conditions, is that correct?
{BIO 1642252 <GO>}
No, we didn't ﬁre anyone for speaking out about working conditions. We support
every employees right to criticize their employers working conditions, but that also
doesn't mean that they're allowed to not follow internal policies. But for sure, you're
rights to protest working conditions, we take that super seriously we have no
problem with that at all.
Amazon increased prices on Prime in 2018, do you think it's getting too expensive?
{BIO 1642252 <GO>}
No, nowhere close. We continue to dramatically under charge for Prime relative to
the value we create for customers and that is the strategy. Our strategy is to build
value in advance with Prime and we always want Prime to be way more viable than
what we charge for it. That's -- we want it to be creating more value than we capture
and that's one of the ways that we're going to do that.
The competitive environment for cloud services seems to be heating up. How is your
AWS business holding up with the threat of more intense competition?
{BIO 1642252 <GO>}
Really well, AWS continues to grow very fast, it's incredibly rare for a business with a
revenue run rate over $40 billion to be growing at more than 30% a year. It just
doesn't happen very often. And our customers are continuing to choose AWS overFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 22 of 24A - Shelly Kay Pfeiﬀer
A - Jeﬀ Bezosother providers. And for a number of reasons -- but one of the big ones is it simply
has a lot more functionality, has the largest and most vibrant community of
customers and partners, it has the most security expertise, the business is innovating
fast.
You can see that everywhere especially in areas like machine learning and AI, the
Internet of Things, server less computing, databases, analytics, microprocessor
development. AWS has much stronger operational performance than the others,
which matters a lot for enterprises who care about application availability, basically
everybody does.
If you look back at Gartner's last Magic Quadrant for infrastructure cloud computing,
AWS' operational availability is meaningfully better than the others. In 2020 that
diﬀerence grew as AWS has many times higher availability than the next largest
provider, which got even further magniﬁed during the COVID crisis. I think the
combination of our having so much more functionality in a much larger more vibrant
partner network and just simply more maturity in the oﬀering are signiﬁcant
diﬀerences today.
AWS got started -- we got a seven-year head start before we faced like minded
competition, that's something that almost never happens in business and it's
allowed us to develop a lot of functionality and to develop that kind of -- that
maturity in the business that you just can't turn on overnight. So and that team
continues to drive, drive that gap and make it bigger. So it's very, very hard in terms
of functionality, maturity, availability, reliability for our competition to catch up to us.
We just keep making that gap wider. So really that's why AWS continues to do so
well.
Can you give us an update on the company's eﬀorts to ﬁght climate change?
{BIO 1642252 <GO>}
Yeah, as you saw from Kara's presentation, we're continuing to prioritize our eﬀorts
during the pandemic, we were pressing ahead to meet the sustainability goals we
laid out last fall. I'm personally super passionate about this topic. Earlier this year, I
announced that I'll be creating the Bezos Earth Fund with $10 billion in funding that
the ﬁrst create is coming this summer. I'm proud of the work our teams are doing in
advance eﬀorts to combat climate change, the climate pledge co-founded in
partnership with Christiana Figueres, calls on signatories to be net zero carbon by
2040 a decade ahead of the Paris goal and send some signal to the market to invest
in green technologies.
We are making great progress on our commitments and Kara I think really showed
you a lot of that. We are committed to reaching 80% renewable energy by 2024 and
a 100% renewable energy by 2030, those are sub-goals inside the bigger 2040 goal.
And I'll tell you on that 100% goal, which our stated goal is to reach a 100%
renewable energy by 2030, the team is pushing to get to a 100% by 2025 and theyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Page 23 of 24A - Shelly Kay Pfeiﬀer
A - Jeﬀ Bezoshave a very challenging, but credible plan to pull that oﬀ. So we would actually meet
that sub-goal ﬁve years early if we can do that.
We have 91 renewable energy projects around the world, they have a capacity to
generate 2900 megawatts and deliver more than 7.6 million megawatt hour sort of
energy annually, it's enough to power more than 690,000 homes.
This will be the last question. What is the 10-year vision for Amazon?
{BIO 1642252 <GO>}
Well, certainly in 10 years, many things are going to evolve signiﬁcantly in that time
frame, technologies will change, I think machine learning technology in particular
will evolve very signiﬁcantly over that 10-year time horizon. But I would always
encourage people when they think about 10 years to ask the question what won't
change, I think that's of the two the -- actually, the more important question because
you can build strategies around things will be stable in time. And in that 10-year
vision, there is bunch of things at Amazon that are not going to change.
One of them and maybe the most important one is that we will stay customer
obsessed instead of competitor obsessed. We will work on maintaining that culture.
We're patient, so we're willing to take time to do things where inventive, it's very
important to maintain that over this 10-year horizon, when you ﬁnd yourself between
a rock and a hard place, the way out is to inventure way out and this team is very
inventive.
We are willing to fail and that willingness to fail is not going to change over 10 years.
The size of our failures should continue to increase as we continue to do bold things.
So -- but the center of all of that what pulls all of that along is being customer
obsessed. And that is really protective of culture, even in a 10 year time horizon.
If your competitor obsessed and you ﬁnd yourself a leader in some arena, it's very
easy to lose your motivation because you're already ahead, why should you run. But
if you're customer obsessed, if that's your motivation, that is very sustainable
because even as a leader, your customers are always dissatisﬁed, they always want
something better and so it's very motivating all along the journey.
So that's -- we'll continue to work to get the right people, people who like that
approach, people who are motivated by customer obsession, people who like to
invent, they have beginners mines, even if they are experts, there is -- these are the
things that will stay the same over 10 years. And if we can keep that culture, that
