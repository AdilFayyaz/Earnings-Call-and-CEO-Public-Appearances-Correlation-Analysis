Good morning. We're so glad you could join us. At Apple, we are fortunate to be
surrounded by people who strive to innovate together to create products and
experiences that enrich people's lives, products that are intuitive and easy to use,
that have a unique integration of hardware and software and that are incredibly
personal.
Today, we're here to talk about three products that have become essential in our
lives, iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch. They're are always with you, useful wherever
and whenever you need them and are designed to work seamlessly together. On
their own, each is industry-leading. Together, they provide a magical experience.
With one tap, AirPods are instantly set up and ready to work with your iPhone and
Apple Watch and automatic switching allow sound to move seamlessly between any
of your Apple devices.
There's also incredible integration between iPhone and Apple Watch. Together they
provide the convenience of having your notiﬁcations and messages on your wrist
and available with just a glance. You can seamlessly handle phone calls between
your iPhone and Apple Watch, and you can set your destination on your iPhone and
your Apple Watch will help guide you along the way. Users can even get their health
and ﬁtness data from Apple Watch and see it on the Health app on their iPhone.
These are just a few examples of the unique and powerful ways our hardware and
software are designed to work together, enhancing and enriching the experience as
you have with these products.
This type of integration is something only Apple can do. And, today, we're going to
make these products and these experiences even better.
Let's get started by talking about Apple Watch. Apple Watch has become an
essential companion. It's always with you, allowing you to do so much right fromFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07

you to stay active and monitors your health and gets help when you need it, and I've
received thousands of letters from customers writing about their personal
experiences using Apple Watch.
I'd like to share just a few of those stories. We do now.
(Video Presentation)
There are so many ways, Apple Watch improves people's lives. These are the reasons
we do what we do. And this year, we are introducing our best Apple Watch lineup
yet, by far. To tell you more, here's Joz.
{BIO 3260601 <GO>}
Each year Apple Watch sets a new standard for what a Smart Watch should be, and
this continuous innovation has made it the number one selling Smart Watch in the
world for seven years running and we're so excited about what's next.
This is the new Apple Watch Series 8. It has all the things you love about Apple
Watch, plus even more. Series 8 is beautifully designed and packed with the most
advanced sensors and technology. It features a big, brilliant, Always On display with
narrow borders that push the screen right to the edge. Detailed watch faces like the
New Lunar, Astronomy, Metropolitan and Modular, looks stunning and is so bright
that texting [ph] complications are easy to read, even when your wrist is down and
Series 8 is durable, it's swim proof, dust proof and crack resistant.
To tell you more about Series 8. Here's Deirdre.
Series 8 is designed to keep you connected to the people and things that you care
about most. It motivates you to stay active and ﬁt, with workouts and Fitness+, there
are so many ways to exercise using Apple Watch. Series 8 helps keep you safe with
fall detection, emergency SoS and Medical ID. It has sleep tracking, cycle tracking
and mindfulness to give you insights into your body and hope you maintain healthy
habits. With best-in-class health sensors that enable ECG, irregular rhythm
notiﬁcations and blood oxygen, it is the ultimate device for a healthy life.
And now, Series 8 brings even more features for health, safety and connectivity,
starting with an innovative new temperature sensor that takes our commitment to
women's health even further.
And here's (inaudible) to tell you about it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 3 of 24Women's health impacts more than just women. It also impacts their families and
communities and menstrual cycles are key to a woman's health, so much so that
many physicians regard them as a vital sign. We added cycle tracking three years
ago. And it has helped tens of millions gain deeper insights into their cycles and
overall health. This year, we're introducing a suite of advanced cycle tracking
features, including valuable information about a critical aspect of women's health
ovulation. As always, we build our health features with two fundamental principles.
First, they are developed using scientiﬁcally validated insights. And, second, privacy
is at the core, designed to keep your data secure and private.
Utilizing the new temperature sensor in Apple Watch Series 8, you can now receive a
retrospective estimate of when you ovulated. Series 8, has a unique two-sensor
design. There is one temperature sensor on the back crystal near your skin and
another just under the display. This design improves accuracy by reducing bias from
the outside environment. Night time wrist temperature can be a good indicator of
overall body temperature. Because while you sleep, your blood vessels dilate,
increasing blood ﬂow to your limbs. Overnight, Series 8 samples your wrist
temperature every ﬁve seconds and it can detect changes as small as 0.1 degree
Celsius.
In the Health App, you'll be able to see nightly shifts from your baseline temperature,
which can be caused by things like exercise, jet lag, alcohol or illness, but tracking
temperature changes is even more useful for those who ovulate, because cyclical
patterns can reveal the biphasic shift. The biphasic shift is an increase in body
temperature that occurs in response to changing hormones and it can indicate
ovulation.
If you're trying to conceive knowing if and when you ovulated can inform your family
planning and conversations with your health care provider. Today, the most common
way to track the biphasic shift is manually with a thermometer and journal. Series 8
makes this much easier and more convenient by providing new, automatic
retrospective ovulation estimates. Further advancing cycle tracking, all users on iOS
16 and Watch OS 9, can now be notiﬁed of possible cycle deviations based on log
cycle data. You may not realize that common cycle deviations like persistent spotting
or prolonged periods could be symptoms of serious health conditions like ﬁbrates,
thyroid disorders or PCOS. That's why it's so important to know when they occur.
The temperature sensing capability on Series 8, plus heart rate and log cycle data
come together to give you a detailed view of your cycle, all of which can be easily
shared with your health care provider to facilitate more informed conversations. We
believe privacy is a fundamental human right and that your health data is yours and
yours alone. Your cycle tracking data is encrypted on your device and only
accessible with your passcode, Touch ID or Face ID.
When using iOS and Watch OS with the default two-factor authentication and a
passcode, Health app data synced to iCloud, is encrypted end-to-end. Meaning that
Apple does not have the key to decrypt the data and therefore cannot read it. OnlyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07

Deirdre O'Brienwith your explicit permission can your health data to be shared and you have
granular control over the types of data you share and who you share it with.
Women's Health is critically important and we're proud to bring these new advanced
cycle tracking capabilities to Apple Watch Series 8. Now back to Deirdre.
Safety features on Apple Watch, like fall detection and emergency SoS have helped
save lives. There is another emergency situation you never want to ﬁnd yourself in
and that's a car crash. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, almost
half of the worst crashes occur in rural areas and the majority involve only a single
vehicle. So, we built an innovative new feature to help in situations like this.
Introducing crash detection. Apple Watch Series 8 can detect if you were in a severe
car crash. When a crash is detected, it will automatically connect you with emergency
services, provide your location and notify your emergency contacts. And to tell you
more here's Ron [ph].
In order to detect a unique courses of a car crash, we developed two new motion
sensors for Series 8, and improved 3-axis gyroscope and the high G-force
accelerometer. The new accelerometer is capable of measuring up to 256 Gs
allowing it to detect the extreme impacts of a crash and samples [ph] motion 4 times
faster at over 3,000 times a second so it can sense the precise moment of impact.
With these new technologies, we built an advanced sensor fusion algorithm to
deliver accurate crash detection. We started by spending years studying vehicle
impacts at state-of-the-art crash test labs. We focused on four main types of severe
crashes front impact, side impact, rear end collision and rollovers. In each crash test,
we captured data from the new gyroscope and accelerometer as well as from other
sensors in Series 8, including the barometer, microphone and GPS. And then, we
used machine learning to incorporate all of these signals into the algorithm, which
was trained on over 1 million hours in real world driving and crash data.
Series 8 can detect crashes in the most popular types of vehicles like passenger cars,
SUVs and pick up trucks. Crash detection runs only when you're driving and
processes data only around the time of a possible crash entirely on your device.
That's crash detection on Apple Watch Series 8. We truly hope you never need it, but
that you will see a little bit safer every time you get in the car.
Now back to Deidre.
Even with the new temperature and motion sensors working in the background,
Apple Watch Series 8 still has all-day 18-hour battery life. But sometimes like if you're
on a long ﬂight or without a charger for the night, you need to preserve battery life.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 5 of 24Unidentiﬁed SpeakerTo help with that, we're introducing low power mode, which can give you up to 36-
hours of battery life on a full charge. Low power mode maintains many of the core
features of Apple Watch like activity tracking and fall detection while temporarily
disabling other features like always on display and auto workout detection,
providing maximum battery savings with the least impact to the user experience.
Low power mode is available on Series 4 and later running Watch OS 9. Cellular
models of Series 8 will also support international roaming. Apple Watch will now be
able to stay connected to your cellular network while you're traveling abroad, simply
add your Apple Watch to your iPhone roaming plan at little or no cost. By the end of
the year, international roaming will be available on more than 30 carriers worldwide.
It will be supported on all cellular models of Apple Watch from Series 5 onward
running Watch OS 9.
Apple Watch Series 8 will be available in four colors of 100% recycled aluminum,
midnight, starlight, silver and Product Red, and in 3 stainless steel ﬁnishes silver, gold
and graphite. There are also great new colors across our most popular band styles.
We also have exciting updates to both Nike Bands, including fresh colors for the
Nike Sport Band and a new Nike Sport Loop with Just Do It woven right into the
textile. And with Watch OS 9, you can use all Nike Watch faces with any Apple Watch.
There are also two stylish new bands for Apple Watch Hermes. Each [ph] diagonal
uses hundreds of micro perforations to create a sporty pattern of the iconic Hermes
H. And Gourmette metal [ph] features a polished silver chain wrapping twice around
the wrist for a bold look. There's also a new Hermes lucky horse watch face that
celebrates their Equestrian roots. That's the incredible new Apple Watch Series 8
with temperature sensing, retrospective ovulation estimates, crash detection and
international roaming.
On top of best-in-class health features like blood oxygen, ECG and sleep tracking, it
has, the latest design that users love with an edge-to-edge display, great durability
and fast-charging and all the new features of Watch OS 9. Apple Watch Series 8 will
start at $399 for GPS and $499 for cellular. And with the purchase of any new Apple
Watch. You also get 3 months of Fitness+ free. You can order today and it will be
available September 16, and that's Apple Watch Series 8 now back to (inaudible).
I am so incredibly excited about Series 8. Let's take one more look at this amazing
watch.

Next, let's talk about Apple Watch SE. SE has been a huge hit. And for more than
80% of SE customers, it's their very ﬁrst Apple Watch. They love how SE delivers the
core Apple Watch experience at a more aﬀordable price. SE is a fantastic way to get
started with Apple Watch, and this year it gets even better. The new SC will be
available in silver, midnight and starlight, all in 100% recycled aluminum and we've
completely redesigned the back case. It's now made of nylon composite materialsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07

Jeﬀrey E. W illiamsthat match perfectly with the three case ﬁnishes. And there is a new production
process that reduces its carbon footprint by over 80%.
Now back to Deirdre to tell you more.
The second generation SE continues to deliver the core beneﬁts of Apple Watch that
users love, like workout and activity tracking, it's swim proof, it has high/low heart
rate notiﬁcations, emergency SoS and fall detection. SE also includes the same
motion sensors as Series 8 to support crash detection. And with AirPods, you can
listen to your music anywhere.
The SE display is 30% larger than that of Series 3 and SE features the same S8
system and package that's in Series 8, making it up to 20% faster than before. SE
continues to be the perfect Apple Watch for family setup. With family setup, you can
use your iPhone to pair watches for your children who don't yet have their own
iPhone. Kids can make phone calls and send messages to contacts that you specify,
connect to emergency services and share their location.
And with new features coming soon like the Home app and Home Keys and Wallet,
family setup allows even more independence for kids and more peace of mind for
parents. SE oﬀers everyone the core features of Apple Watch and now includes the
faster S8 SiP, crash detection, new case colors with matching back cases and all the
new capabilities of Watch OS 9, all at a more aﬀordable price starting at $249 for GPS

We are so excited about the great new features coming to Series 8 and Apple Watch
SE, and can't wait for people to start using them, but we're not done yet.
Here's Jeﬀ to tell you, even more.
{BIO 16886071 <GO>}
We've been working on something completely new. Over the years, we've spoken to
renowned explores accomplished adventures and the lead athletes who are drawn
to some of the most extreme environments like Ray Zahab, an extreme explorer who
has crossed some of the harshest environments on foot, including the length [ph] of
the Sahara Desert and expeditions across Antarctica and the Arctic and Nadia Aly, an
accomplished diver, expedition leader and acclaimed underwater photographer and
Scott Jurek one of the most dominant ultra marathon runners in history and a seven-
time winner of the Western States 100 mile. Inspired by their stories, we set out to
create an Apple Watch designed speciﬁcally for exploration, adventure and
endurance and it's extraordinary.
This has been years in the making and we can't wait to show it to you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07

Page 7 of 24(Video Presentation)
This is Apple Watch Ultra, a completely new design, reimagined with extraordinary
new capabilities that expand the ways you can use Apple Watch. Every detail has
been engineered to create the most rugged and capable Apple Watch ever. It starts
with the case made from aerospace grade titanium that strikes the perfect balance of
weight, durability and corrosion resistance. The titanium case extends up to surround
the ﬂat sapphire front crystal protecting it from edge impacts that can occur during
extreme activities and at the center of the 49-millimeter case is our biggest brightest
display ever in Apple Watch, making it easier to read in the harshest sunlight.
We also added a new button, the action button, in high-contrast international
orange. It's customizable and gives users quick physical control for a range of
functions. The Digital Crown has a larger diameter and coarser grooves and the side
button stands proud of the case, both designed to be used while wearing gloves
and the audio system excels when you're out in the elements. We added a second
speaker for increased volume. Three strategically placed microphones and advanced
software help ensure voice clarity on calls even in windy condition and for maximum
connectivity and communication Cellular's built into every Apple Watch Ultra.
Ultra has the biggest battery of any Apple Watch yet. It gets up to 36 hours of battery
life on a single charge and Apple Watch Ultra can even get up to 60 hours of battery
life from multi-day adventure using a new battery optimization setting coming later
this fall. And to complement the rugged utility of the hardware, we created our most
technical face yet. Wayﬁnder. With a host of critical information, it includes a
compass and the dial and can be customized for the mountain, ocean or trail. And to
optimize for evening conditions, there's night mode just rotate the crown and the UI
turns red for better visibility in the dark.
Apple Watch Ultra is designed to push boundaries. It's a versatile tool for anyone
who appreciate outdoor adventure, water sports and endurance training. And for
each of these, we created a special band is meticulously crafted as the Watch itself.
With explorers in mind, we developed the Alpine Loop. For titanium G-hook securely
fastens through the reinforced top loops. The band is woven using an innovative
process that integrates to two layers without any stitching.
The Ocean Band is molded in a high-performance elastomer with a tubular
geometry, allowing it to stretch for a perfect ﬁt even over a wet suit. The titanium
buckle and adjustable loops secure the band during high speed water sports. For
endurance athletes, we created the trail loop. The lightweight textile has increased
the elasticity for comfortable snug ﬁt. It's our thinnest band yet with a convenient tab
for making quick adjustments.
Ultra is a totally new expression of Apple Watch. Whether you're an accomplished
athlete or explorer or aspire to try exciting new activities, we think you're going to
love it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 8 of 24Unidentiﬁed SpeakerHere's Jules [ph] to tell you more.
We set out to make Apple Watch Ultra the best sport watch out there with features
for every athlete. GPS performance is critical for serious runners and athletes who
want the most accurate metrics. A typical GPS solution works well most of the time,
but some environments are really tricky, like when tall buildings or dense trees block
satellites making accurate GPS readings nearly impossible when training and
competing. The fame Chicago Marathon, is a great example. It's a notoriously
challenging environment for GPS, because a big portion is run between skyscrapers,
so we designed a new precision dual-frequency GPS solution that in addition to L1
also include the latest frequency, L5, plus new custom positioning algorithm.
In dense urban conditions like this, Apple Watch Ultra provides the most accurate
GPS of any sport watch in the market. We also brought some great workout updates
to Watch OS 9, inspired by high performance athletes. With new metrics, views and
experiences like vertical oscillation, heart rate zones and custom workouts and now
with (Technical Diﬃculty) new feature that automatically detects when you arrive at a
running track, ensuring the most accurate pace and distance. The action button let's
(inaudible) market segment with a single press for the ultimate track running
experience.
For endurance athletes, the bigger battery makes a big diﬀerence. Of course, you
can easily complete a marathon with battery like to spare, using the new low power
workout setting most athletes can do a 2.4 miles swim, plus a 112-mile bike ride and
then run a marathon to complete a long distance travel on with full-precision GPS
and heart rate. But Ultra is so much more. It's designed to help you explore the most
extreme and remote location from freezing cold mountains at minus 20 degree
Celsius to the blazing desert heat at 55 degree Celsius, or 130 degrees Fahrenheit.
When navigating in the back [ph] country a compass is an essential tool, so we
completely redesigned the Compass app with new precision views and added
capability. The orienteering view includes compass way points to mark a position like
the location of the trailhead or your tense and they can be quickly added using the
action button. And if you get lost or disoriented backtrack uses GPS data to create a
path of where you've been, so you can easily retrace your steps and it turns on
automatically in the background when you go oﬀ the grid. Just in case.
Getting help when you need it is critical, especially in the back country, that's why
Apple Watch Ultra has a built-in 86 decibels siren that you can activate using the
action button, it has a unique sound pattern that alerts others to your location up to
600 feet or 180 meters away. Finally, Apple Watch Ultra, has been designed for water
sports, it can withstand the intense dynamic forces of activities like kayak surﬁng and
wakeboarding, and it can go deep below the waves because we engineered it to
twice the water-resistance, WR100. Using its new built-in depth gauge Ultra
automatically launches a new Depth app when submerged to show current depth,
underwater time and water temperature.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07

Jeﬀrey E. W illiamsWe also want Ultra to be a great tool for recreational scuba divers. So it's been
certiﬁed to EN 13319, the internationally recognized standard for dive computers and
gauges and we're partnering with Huish Outdoors outdoors to create an exclusive
app that turns Apple Watch Ultra into a capable dive computer for recreational
scuba diving to the depth of 40m or 130 feet.
To tell you more about this incredible app here's Mike Huish, CEO of Huish
Outdoors.
Our company is world-renowned for powering every aspect of the underwater
experience. And Oceanic has been a leading innovator in scuba diving for over 50
years, introducing some of the very ﬁrst dive computers. We're thrilled to announce
our new Oceanic+ app for Apple Watch Ultra. This is so exciting for anyone
interested in scuba diving, because now the same watch you wear everyday is also
your dive computer.
We've designed Oceanic+ with all the key features for recreational scuba divers and
free drivers and it works seamlessly with our iPhone app to plan your dives. Our dive
planner calculates depth and time and integrates dive conditions like tides, water
temperature and even up to date. Information from the community like visibility and
currents.
The best way to experience this on a real dive. So let's get the water. Your dive
metrics are of simple and easy to read on the large bright display. Our app runs the
Buhlmann decompression algorithm, which constantly calculates and monitors dive
parameters. So from the moment you start dive all critical information is just glance
away. And unlike most dive computers, which require you to perform a complex
sequence of button presses to ﬁnd the information you need, our app uses simple
gestures, rotate the Digital Crown to access additional screens or press the action,
but to set a compass heading Oceanic+ provides all the safety warnings that you
would expect from the most advanced dive computers today.
Like decompression limits, excessive sand rate [ph]. And at the end of your dive,
safety stock guidance, all smartly color-coded to help make complex information,
easy to understand. Right after the dive, your data including your GPS entry and exit
location automatically syncs to your iPhone and the cloud where you can see a
summary of your dive proﬁle. And in your log book, you can sort and search past
dives and instantly share your adventures with family and friends, as well as the
community and we can't wait for you to try it out later this fall. The Oceanic+ app and
Apple Watch Ultra, together create a powerful and easy to use dive computer that
will inspire more people to discover and explore the underwater world.

Users depend on their iPhone for so many things, which is why iPhone 14 delivers all-
day battery life. iPhone 14 Plus last even longer throughout your day with the best
battery life ever in an iPhone. The larger display and best battery life were previously
only available in our Pro Max models and now we're bringing it to even more
people.
Now, let's talk about performance iPhone 13 Pro introduced in amazing chip the A15
Bionic with a 5-core GPU. It's a powerhouse that unlocks extraordinary features and
delivers great power eﬃciency privacy and security.
Now, we are bringing this proven pro level performance to iPhone 14 the 5-core GPU
is 18% faster, enabling even smoother graphics in computationally heavy workloads
by complex gaming. It has a powerful 6-core CPU with two high-performance and
four eﬃciency cores and 16-core neural engine that pushes the limit of machine
learning. Since its introduction, A15 continues to be faster than all of the competition
at any price. A15 is essential to iPhone 14. And with the custom image signal
processor A15 also powers innovative features in the amazing new camera system.
Here's Karen [ph] to tell you more.
IPhone is always with you and ready to quickly and eﬀortlessly capture your life's
moments. Last year, over 3 trillion photos were taken with iPhone. We develop
unique state of the art camera technology while staying true to the craft of
photography. Lighting is a fundamental part of getting the best shot possible it plays
such an important role in capturing every day memories and jaw-dropping
moments. iPhone enables gorgeous photo capture across the entire range of light
from bright light, where colors come alive to low light like indoors tonight time
scenes. And iPhone 14, again, sets the standard for photo and video capture,
regardless of where you are. It has a new 12-megapixel main camera with a larger
sensor and larger pixels at 1. 9 microns. It has a faster F/1.5 aperture and sensor-shift
OIS for a powerful main camera upgrade and takes stunning everywhere. The faster
aperture allows better motion freezing, showing us vibrant colors that bring the
scene to life with great texture and detail.
It delivers a 49% improvement in low light capture for more vibrant color and better
results in challenging lighting environments while making night mode exposure
twice as fast. And the ultrawide camera takes incredible-looking photos and video,
which is great for wider shots and unique perspective.
The front camera enables great looking selﬁes, high quality video during FaceTime
and so much more. iPhone 14 has a new TrueDepth camera. It has a faster f/1.9
aperture for a 38% improvement in low light capture for photos and video. The newFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07

Page 14 of 24front camera has auto focus for the ﬁrst time, so it can focus clearly at multiple
distances together with TrueDepth capabilities, the new front camera now has a
hybrid system that can focus faster even in low light, so you'll get better Southeast
Group shocks can be in focus from farther away and you'll be able to show us great
detail up close.
Low light environments can be a unique challenge with photography. We've made
incredible progress in capturing in low light over the years with increasingly larger
sensors and faster apertures, more advanced lenses, all paired with intelligent
software and our powerful Apple silicon, that results in incredible capabilities for low
light.
Deep Fusion is a great example. It's a huge achievement and computation of
photography and uses the powerful neural engine to combine multiple frames into a
single image this delivers extraordinary detail and preserves even the subtlest
textures in these mid to lower light environments.
Now, (Technical Diﬃculty) in these mid to lower light environments. Now, we are
taking our image pipeline further by applying Deep Fusion much earlier in the
process on uncompressed images. This retains much more information and detail
and enables rendering of more colors and brighter colors. This new process unlocks
our biggest step forward yet for low light performance, we call it Photonic Engine.
This is our enhanced image pipeline that dramatically improves low light photos. It
goes beyond what hardware alone can provide the best part is that it beneﬁts every
camera. When compared to iPhone 13, it enables photo low light improvement up to
2 times on the front camera, 2 times on the ultrawide camera and 2.5 times on the
new main camera.
You'll get photos with much better detail and color, helping you remember the
moment the way you lived it. There is also a big improvement to video this year.
IPhone leads the industry with the highest quality video and has great stabilization. It
now has a new even more advanced stabilization mode that gives users a powerful
tool when capturing moments on the move. This is action mode. It uses the full
sector with more overscan and advanced roll correction to make video look
incredibly stable when you're in the middle of the action simply toggle it on for great
looking smooth video without having to carry extra gear like a gimbal. It also
supports Dolby Vision HDR. The new iPhone 14 camera system is a huge upgrade,
enabling incredible looking shots across the entire range of shooting conditions.
Back to you, (inaudible).
Now, let's talk about connectivity. iPhone has powerful capabilities that help our
users stay in touch on the go. This is especially true for 5G, enabling super-fast
downloads, better streaming and real-time connectivity and momentum for 5G is
stronger than ever with over 250 carriers around the world on 5G. We've also made
big improvements to cellular technologies like eSIM making it even easier to
connect. An eSIM is a digital SIM that eliminates the need for physical SIM card. WithFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 15 of 24eSIM you can quickly transfer an existing cellular plan or get a new cellular plan, all
digitally.
You can even store multiple eSIMs on the same device, meaning multiple cellular
plans and phone numbers and it's more secure. Someone can't remove the physical
SIM card if your iPhone is lost or stolen. eSIM setup is easy. In just a few simple steps,
users are ready to make calls send messages and browse the web, you can even do
this without a Wi-Fi connection extensive planning and testing with carriers helped
enable the iPhone eSIM experience. This includes the US, where eSIM support has
skyrocketed. Thanks to AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and many more.
Now, for the ﬁrst time all US models no longer have the SIM trey, so you don't have
to deal with a physical SIM card anymore. eSIM provides a simpler way to activate
and use iPhone.
Next, let's talk about some features that make iPhone even more essential. iPhone is
there when you need it most that conﬁdence is especially important in moments
when your safety is at risk. With iPhone 14, we have two critical new safety features it
has crash detection. The same feature, you just heard about on new Apple Watch
models.
IPhone 14 has a new high dynamic range gyroscope and a new dual-core
accelerometer that is able to detect up to 256 Gs and you can automatically notify
emergency services and emergency contacts if you are in a severe car crash. If you
have both Apple Watch and iPhone they seamlessly work together to get you help
eﬃciently.
Now here is Ashley [ph] to tell you about another new safety service coming to
iPhone.
Emergencies don't always happen when it's convenient. When you need help, you
need it wherever you are even if you don't have Wi-Fi or cell service. Now, your
iPhone can connect you with the help you need when you're oﬀ the grid like this.
(Video Presentation)
Today, we are announcing a groundbreaking new service for iPhone, emergency SoS
via satellite. While iPhone is designed for a best-in-class cellular experience
connecting to satellite presents an entirely new set of challenges. Smartphones
connect to cell towers that are a few miles away. Over the last several decades
carriers have built more and more cell towers to improve the strength and speed of
their network service. However, there are some places like winding back roads and
mountain ridges that cell towers don't reach. Connectivity in these areas can be
provided by communications satellites. Unlike stationary cell towers communication
satellites are hundreds of miles above the earth and ﬂying at over 15,000 miles per
hour. To connect to these satellites, you need to be outside with a clear view of theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 16 of 24sky and the bandwidth is so limited that even sending a text message is a technical
challenge.
Typically, the only way to tap into such network is with an expensive device that uses
a bulky external antenna, we knew that approach just wouldn't work for iPhone. So,
we invented another way. We designed and built custom components and speciﬁcs
software, so that iPhone 14 antennas can connect to satellites' unique frequencies.
That connection is only possible when the phone is pointing directly at a satellite.
However satellites ﬂy too high to be seen by the human eye. So we created a unique
user experience that shows you where to point your phone to establish a connection
and stay connected as the satellite moves this way. No bulky antenna is needed.
Once connected, you need to send and receive enough information to get
emergency help. Standard messaging protocols are not designed for satellite limited
bandwidth so we create a custom short text compression algorithm to reduce the
average size of messages by a factor of three. Thanks to its algorithm, it can take less
than 15 seconds to send the message if you have a clear view of the sky in conditions
such as like foliage [ph], it may take a few minutes and since each message can take
some time, we knew standard back and forth conversation would take far too long
for an emergency situation, we worked with emergency experts to surface the
questions they're most likely to ask and we provided the most common responses
for you to choose from. With just a few tabs. With fewer messages to write and send,
you can get help quicker after your message is relayed to a ground station, it needs
to reach the right emergency service provider. If that emergency service provider
accepts text messages we will connect you to them directly. If they only accept voice
calls, we have set up relay centers staﬀed with highly trained emergency specialists
ready to get your text and call an emergency service provider on your behalf.
It took years to make this vision a reality to game changing hardware, software and
infrastructure innovation. This breakthrough service can also be used in more casual
less dire circumstances. So if you're out on a long hike, you can use the Find My app
to share your location manually via satellite. This lets your loved ones know where
you are without you even sending a message.
Now back to (inaudible).
We believe that this service is such an essential part of the iPhone experience that
we'll include it free for two years with iPhone 14. It launches in November, and we're
starting with the US and Canada.
Now, let's talk about the environment. Since 2020, Apple's corporate operations
have been carbon-neutral to reach our goal of carbon-neutral products by 2030,
we're looking at our environmental impact across our supply chain in the entire
product lifecycle. Over 200 of our suppliers have committed to 100% renewable
energy for Apple production. Our suppliers work to create less waste and then we
[ph] use recycle or compost.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 17 of 24Tim CookIn ﬁscal year 2021 alone, IPhone suppliers kept over 250,000 metric tons of waste
from ending up in the landﬁll, that's about one year's worth of waste from 730,000
households. We build our products to last. This durability enabled millions of trade-
ins to ﬁnd new owners in 2021. And when it is time to recycle an iPhone, that has
environmental beneﬁts too. In fact, 1 metric ton of recovered main logic boards in
cameras has the same amount of gold and copper as over 2,000 metric tons of
mined rock.
So don't throw away your old iPhone or leave it sitting in a drawer bring it to your
nearest store or mail it in. Together, we can reduce our impact on the planet one
step at a time and that iPhone 14 with powerful new cameras Photonic Engine, action
mode, A15 Bionic,with the 5-core GPU, emergency SoS via satellite, crash detection
and the larger 6.7-inch display size with the best battery life in an iPhone and so
much more and later this fall Apple Fitness+ will be available to all iPhone users,
even if they don't yet have an Apple Watch.
IPhone 14 will start at just $799. This is a same starting price as last year's iPhone 13,
but with so much more capability that sets a new standard for iPhone. And iPhone 14
Plus starts at just $899 bringing the larger 6.7-inch display and the best battery life to
more people than ever. We also have incredible oﬀers from Apple and our partners,
including up to $800 oﬀ in the US when you trade in a qualifying iPhone.
IPhone 14, and iPhone 14 Plus are available for pre-order starting on September 9.
iPhone 14 will be available on September 16 and iPhone 14 Plus will be available on
October 7, we're thrilled about iPhone 14.

IPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have incredible new features that will help our users in
meaningful ways and that's just the ﬁrst part of our iPhone story today. With our Pro
models, we've introduced some of our most important technologies like Face ID,
Super Retina display and our most advanced camera features like sensor-shift

Our Pro models feature beautiful and strong surgical grade stainless steel. Together
with our industry-leading durability features including Ceramic Shield and water
resistance. They come in four gorgeous colors, a new space black, silver, gold and
this all new deep purple. iPhone 14 Pro introduces a new front design that is sure to
become iconic, it starts with the new TrueDepth camera. We redesigned all
components to ﬁt into a smaller size using 30% less area we put the proximity
sensing behind the display for the ﬁrst time. With this change, we reconsidered how
you interact with your iPhone.
Throughout the day, you experience diﬀerent types of alerts and notiﬁcations and
these are often happening while you're doing other things on your iPhone. So, we
developed a new experience that's even better.
Here's Alan to tell you more.
Our goal was to design a space that clearly and consistently surfaces alerts and
background activity in a rich and delightful way. The result being an entirely new an
intuitive way to interact with iPhone when it truly blurs the line between hardware
and software, we're calling it the Dynamic Island.
We've designed this new space to be highly adaptive, so can ﬂuidly expand into
diﬀerent shapes using uniquely crafted animations and transitions. So now, when you
receive an alert, the Dynamic Island expands to notify you. Our ambition is to clearly
convey the information and present content and controls without distracting from
the app you are in. This works across the entire system for things like conﬁrming
AirPods are connected, muting or starting to charge. Each alert has its own
personality, has been designed with its own unique character making it easy to
identify the glance. But when you are using Face ID or tapping your iPhone in transit
locations.
The Dynamic Island also displays ongoing background activity, but when you're
playing music I swipe to go home, the music app gracefully morphs into the dynamic
we are staying active we even decided to show the current album art. It's also
completely interactive. You can tap and hold to expose more options or tap to go
back to the app.
So, now when you are on a call, you have easy access to controls without leaving the
app you are using. We've designed all these animations to feel ﬂuid, lively and highly
responsive. The Dynamic Island is always live and active heightening the sense of
vitality, by adapting in real-time to show you important information like our next
direction for maps and it's always visible for ongoing activities, but when you're
using we the timer.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 19 of 24Greg JoswiakWe designed live activities, a new feature on the iOS 16 lock screen to work
seamlessly with the Dynamic Island including support for third-party apps, so you
can keep track of what's happening from anywhere on iPhone, like following a
baseball game without needing to leave the app you are in or not missing the Lyft
ride while texting friends.
We've also created a robust design system for developers. So, every alert looks and
feels consist, no matter which app it comes from. And when you have more than one
background activity the Dynamic Island playfully adapts bubbling out into two
elements at Apple, we're focused on creating extraordinary products. How it's born
from designing hardware and software together, so you don't know where one ends
and the other begins. The Dynamic Island, does this in a truly magical way, and
enables the entirely new iPhone experience Dr. Jos.
{BIO 3260601 <GO>}
IPhone 14 Pro has a stunning new display with Pro features this is the most advanced
display we've ever shipped. I iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max come in two great
size now with even thinner borders, more active area and Dynamic Island. I'll it is also
brighter. The new display provides peak ACR brightness of 1,600 nits, bringing
iPhone to the same level as the Pro Display XDR.
So photos and HDR movies are going to look amazing, including those shoot on
your iPhone And for those bright sunny days iPhone can now push brightness even
higher for a peak of 2,000 nits, has twice as bright as before, and the highest peak
brightness of any smart phone.
The new lock screen on iOS 16 introduces more personalization with widgets and
live activities. So this is the perfect time to introduce Always On display. It's easy to
see the time and other important information without raising your iPhone or tapping
the display this gives essential information available. For the moment, where all you
need is just a glance.
This is made possible by a number of new technologies that make the display
incredibly power-eﬃcient. This can operate at a refresh rate as low as 1 hertz with a
new low power and we further improved our LTPO technology, allowing the display
to intelligently dim the entire lock screen. We also take advantage of multiple co-
processors in our chip to refresh the display using minimal power to the time,
widgets and live activities are always available and we use our photographic
expertise and powerful image segmentation to dim wallpaper photos while
preserving skin tones. So they continue to look great and you can keep an eye on
your live activities without even touching you iPhone.
With all these incredible features, the new Super Retina XDR is the most advanced
display ever in a smartphone.
IPhone 14 Pro is powered by our new A16 Bionic chip. Our newest generation of

performance with leading power eﬃciency is a hallmark of Apple silicon A16 has
nearly 16 billion transistors, the most ever in an iPhone. This is our ﬁrst chip built on a
state-of-the-art 4-nanometer process enabling greater eﬃciency while delivering
even more performance.
In fact A16 Bionic is the fastest chip ever in a smartphone, the competition is still
working to catch up with the performance of A13, which we ﬁrst introduced with
iPhone 11 three years ago. The new 6 core CPU of A16 is generations ahead. It's up to
a whopping 40% faster than the competition. The CPU uses our best-in-class fusion
architecture, which delivers both, leading performance and leading eﬃciency. Our
two high performance cores are faster and use 20% lower power compared to the
A15 Bionic and most daily tasks could be handled by our high eﬃciency cores at the
same performance level of these new eﬃciency cores use 1/3 the power of even the
best eﬃciency cores from the competition. This allows iPhone to deliver amazing
battery life, while still being extremely responsive.
The new 16 core Neural Engine is capable of nearly 17 trillion operations per second,
which helps power iPhones advanced computational photography and the 5 core
GPU has 50% more memory bandwidth, great for graphic-intensive games. There's
also an entirely new display engine in A16 this engine enables the 1 hertz refresh rate
always-on capability higher peak brightness and the advanced antialiasing that
makes Dynamic Island animations so incredibly smooth.
A16 also ﬂexes every muscle for the iPhone 14 pro-camera system. It uses a CPU, GPU
neural engine and ISP to perform up to 4 trillion operations per photo and the image
signal processor was designed to support a new generation of technology that
provides our most powerful Pro camera system ever. This empowers every user to
take their best photos and videos from the casual user the professional.
We're excited for iPhone 14 Pro to push the boundaries for what's possible and
ushering (Technical Diﬃculty) to tell you more here's (inaudible).
IPhone 14 Pro introduces a brand new class of camera to iPhone, a 48 megapixel
camera with a quad pixel sensor, it's our largest sensor yet 65% larger than the one
on iPhone 13 Pro, features our second-generation sensor-shift OIS and 100% focus
pixels.
It also features a new 24 millimeter focal length popular in photography for its
versatility to shoot great landscapes, group portraits even single subjects. The quad-
pixel sensor enables a new ﬂexible approach which adapts the photo you're
shooting. For most photos, we want to optimize for a light captured. So the new
sensor groups every four source into one large quad pixel to 4 times more light. This
further improved light capture while maintaining the practical 12 megapixel photo
size combined with the photonic engine, the new main camera has up to 2 times low
light improvement for photos compared to iPhone 13 Pro.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 21 of 24Let's take a look and what the main camera can do. You can capture stunning photos
across all lighting conditions. In this brighter shot, the main camera captured a
beautiful rich color of her skin, the detail of the ﬁber in the blanket and even a little
of her joy. For this photo, we locked exposure on the woman's face as a vibrant
feathers fell iPhone keep her in sharp focus while creating a colorful texture around
her.
In this low light example, the photonic engine captures incredible dynamic range
from the warm glow of her skin,, the color of her eyes to every little crease, fold and
texture in the garment. The new sensor can optimize for detail using each pixel
individually, providing more creative options for shooting and editing in Pro
workﬂows.
With this approach, we can go beyond the three ﬁxed lenses of the pro-camera
system adding a new two (inaudible) photo option for our users. We use the middle
12 megapixels of the new sensor to deliver a full resolution photo and 4K video with
optical quality this telephoto has larger big source and a faster aperture than any
previous (inaudible) photo camera on iPhone, delivering incredible photos and
videos and it has a familiar focal length. That is great for Portrait mode capturing
stunning detail with beautiful bokeh.
We're also using the new sensor to optimize for detail in Pro raw. Pro raw merges the
best of our intelligent computational photography, with the beneﬁts of the raw
format giving pro photographers, full corrective control over things like sharpening
white balance in our advanced on mapping with more bit depth and dynamic range.
You can now shoot Pro raw at 48 megapixel resolution taking advantage of every
pixel in the main camera and unlocking incredible editing ﬂexibility. The new sensor
has a diﬀerent pixel pattern, so we designed a new machine learning model that
further enhances detail and reduces noise. This leverages the full power of A16
Bionic and results in an unprecedented level of detail.
It's unbelievable how much we can zoom in, like in this ethereal photo in Hawaii,
revealing each individual rock on the beach and even dry branches from the trees,
with more pixels pro photographers will can reframe their photos while still retaining
great resolution.
We are able to keep the sharpness and warmth of her eyes. As the focal point of this
high resolution image. This makes the 48 megapixel main camera even more
versatile further empowering the creativity, of the most Pro users.
IPhone 14 Pro also has a new Ultra Wide camera with a larger sensor, more focus
pixels and together with the Photonic Engine delivers a massive up to 3 times
improvement in light capture for photos. The new lens is sharper with more detail so
