Okay, we're going to go right into the next one. My name is Eric Sheridan. I'm UBS'
US Internet and interactive entertainment analyst.
With me today is Carolyn Everson who is the Vice President of Global Marketing
Solution for Facebook where she leads the Company's relationships with top
marketers and agencies. Carolyn oversees a team of regional leaders and the team
is focused on global partnerships, global agencies and Facebook's creative shop.
Prior to joining Facebook Carolyn was the corporate vice president of Microsoft's
global advertising sales and trade marketing teams.
So Carolyn, thanks for being here today.
{BIO 15342167 <GO>}
Thank you for having me.
{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Okay, before we get into the questions I am going to read Facebook's safe harbor
statement. So before we get started, on behalf of Facebook I would like to take this
opportunity to remind you that during the course of this conversation Carolyn may
make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the business strategy
or prospects of Facebook.
Facebook cautions you to consider the important risk factors that could cause actual
results to diﬀer materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These risk
factors are described under the caption risk factors in Facebook's quarterly report on
Form 10-Q ﬁled with the SEC on November 5, 2015.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-08

Page 2 of 17Carolyn EversonIn addition please note that any forward-looking statements that Carolyn makes are
based on assumptions as of today. And Facebook undertakes no obligation to
update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
So now we have that behind us, maybe I'll start with the big picture Carolyn. I think
one of the big questions that investors always have is what is the conversation like
between Facebook, its advertising partners as you attempt to balance user
engagement against your advertisers goals on Facebook more broadly? So maybe
you could give us a state of where that conversation sits today between Facebook
and your advertising partners.
{BIO 15342167 <GO>}
Sure. So I've been at Facebook for at least ﬁve years in February and the
conversation has evolved dramatically. Five years ago advertisers and agencies had
questions about whether or not Facebook ads worked and that was the ﬁrst hurdle
that we felt we needed to overcome.
Fast-forward to today and the conversation's really revolving around several topics.
Number one, culture.
Companies are trying to understand how they have to evolve their corporate culture,
to move more quickly to be more collaborative, to innovate at a more rapid pace, to
think about talent retention in very new ways. Actually a lot of my conversations
today with marketers are to help them understand the Facebook culture and how
that could adapt to companies that have been around for 100-plus years. That's the
ﬁrst thing that's on every big Company's mind.
The second is just a profound shift in mobile. So if we think about mobile as in my
opinion the most important transformation we have had in marketing in over 100
years.
Radio took 38 years to get to 50 million people. TV took 13 years. Mobile has taken
10 years to get to 2 billion people.
We have never seen such a transformation. And it's not just that marketing needs to
evolve because consumer behavior has shifted dramatically. Actually entire business
models have to evolve.
If you were a company today starting a retail business or a ﬁnancial services business
in all likelihood you would be starting as a mobile-ﬁrst company. And so mobile as a
topic is at the CEO and Board level conversation that we're having with all of our
companies. So that's the second thing that they are thinking about.
The third is then more granular on advertising. Advertising for decades used to be
advertising at people. We built factories, we build brands by doing mass reach
advertising and it worked very eﬀectively for many, many years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-08

Carolyn EversonNow that consumers have the most personal device they've ever had in the history
of devices their expectation around marketing has changed dramatically. The
expectation is if you're going to show up on my phone which is very personal, it's my
contacts, it's my apps, you need to show up in a relevant, useful, delightful manner.
And so really rethinking how data becomes the new currency for really strong
creative is an area that we're advising clients quite a lot in.
And I think more broadly as amended from and challenge because if you think
about what I said ﬁve years ago do Facebook ads work, now the measurement
question is actually a lot of the measurement that the industry has been using for
years is actually not working well in mobile because it's been cookies-based. And
cookies work in a desktop environment and yet the consumer behavior has shifted
not only to mobile but to multi-device usage.
There's over 950 million people that use multiple devices a day and so using
cookies is no longer an eﬀective way of measuring eﬀectiveness. You need to go to
people-based measurement. And so all of the measurement challenges that
companies are facing are very top of mind.
So that's how the conversation has evolved. I think right now it's really about how do
you utilize this drastic shift in consumer behavior to grow your business in a very
diﬀerent way than marketers have done for the last several decades.
{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
So maybe I want to stay on that topic of measurement and attribution. It's something
the Facebook team led by Cheryl talks a fair bit about to investors when you have
your earnings call every quarter.
What is the state of measurement and attribution today? What are the tools that
advertisers want to see from Facebook? Where it is the game going from a
measurement and attribution standpoint?
{BIO 15342167 <GO>}
Well the ﬁrst and foremost is actually we're very principled about measurement. We
tell marketers and agencies that they should not spend a single dollar with us unless
they believe we're driving their business outcomes. And that's a very, I think it's a
very normal statement but apparently it's a very unusual statement out there.
And the reason we believe that so strongly is that at the end of the day our job at
Facebook is to grow our client's business be it a small business or it's the world's
largest companies. And we think we have very eﬀective ways to measure the
eﬀectiveness of it and everything marketers should do should have a business
outcome. As opposed to social metrics which is where the industry was several years
ago when companies were measuring things likes, share, comments or followers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-08

Page 4 of 17We want to be held accountable for are we driving online conversion, oﬀ-line sales,
brand awareness, lift. So on and so forth. So that's how we think about it from a
principal standpoint.
In terms of where it is today we have invested in ad tech more broadly. Atlas is really
the core strategy that we're pursuing from a measurement standpoint. And what
Atlas does, we bought it from Microsoft the couple of years ago.
We basically rebuilt it from scratch and we built it to be mobile-ﬁrst, people-based
and so that it would work eﬀectively across device. And not only work eﬀectively
across device, you could be able to link oﬀ-line measurement with online
measurement to really drive lift and understand whether or not your campaign not
only by the way on Facebook or Instagram but more broadly in the ecosystem are
they actually driving lift.
So the two things that we're pursuing very aggressively are this conversion lift which
is basically now being used by about 200 of our advertisers. They've done about
500 studies and it uses A and B testing to determine whether or not the ads on
Facebook and Instagram and other properties are driving lift or not.
Lift can be deﬁned as online sales. It can be deﬁned in brand awareness or ad
recalled. Very clear A, B experimental design, is it being eﬀective.
The other thing we're doing is we're asking advertisers to put a conversion pixel on
so they can track the actual behavior of consumers across the device. It's very
eﬀective for understanding the consumer journey which often bounces back and
forth between devices throughout the day. So that's a second product that we're
doing.
Atlas right now is being tested and used by a number of marketers. We're pleased
with the progress. It's still early days.
The industry has been using cookie-based measurement for over 10 years. And it's
going to take time to shift to be about people-based and about business outcomes-
based. But we think it's incredibly important.
The other thing that we're doing is being sensitive to measurement in emerging
markets. Because we have here in the more developed markets we have access to
things like Nielsen and we have access to things like Datalogix to measure in-store
sales. But if you're an emerging market some of those capabilities don't exist.
So we launched mobile polling as an example where a brand can get a very quick
read on the device where the ads are actually being served whether or not it's
actually driving a result. And so we do mobile polling now not only with Nielsen but
with Millward Brown and that's being widely used in emerging markets.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-08

Carolyn Everson{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Okay. I want to shift a little bit to the types of marketers and how they interact with
Facebook. Maybe we'd start ﬁrst with brand advertisers.
That's what you sort of led with Facebook in many ways is now talking to advertisers
who've been around for a 100 years and big brands ﬁt in that category. What is the
state of brand advertising on Facebook and how has that changed over the last one
to two years?
{BIO 15342167 <GO>}
We have the privilege of working with all the top brand marketers in the world and
from that vantage point we see them at very diﬀerent points of the journey. We have
major marketers that have been with us for over ﬁve years where we have very
sophisticated global joint business plans and we are absolutely driving business
outcomes for a majority of their large brands.
We have other large marketers that are very early in their stage of understanding the
digital transformation. I think the biggest shift that I'm seeing with brand marketing is
that brands are actually brands, more traditional brand marketing is becoming more
like DR marketing. And DR advertisers are very interested in what brands are doing
and there is a blurring of the two that are occurring.
So let me give you a very speciﬁc example. If you are a CPG company, if you're a
Proctor & Gamble or a Unilever, or Coca-Cola, Pepsi, you name the company they
are very focused on what is the future going to look like from an e-commerce
perspective, how am I going to be able to sell my products directly to the consumer?
So with that is an area of strategic growth for them where are they going to learn and
get inspiration from? They are going to learn and get inspiration from the e-
commerce companies and the DR-oriented companies.
Conversely we see a tremendous amount of investment being put into India and
greater China in particular for e-comm companies that want to learn how to become
global brands. Because no longer when you build a company are you just thinking
about your consumers in a geographic radius. Now you have access to consumers
around the world and they are very interested in learning about brand.
So we see a lot of lines blurring between brand and DR advertising. I will say from a
more traditional brand perspective they have been very delighted with the
innovations we've made on video. Sight, sound and motion has been a format that
they had loved for many, many years, of course.
It's been what they've used on TV very, very eﬀectively. And with not only our
autoplay video but all of the innovations that we're making with 360 video and
testing out video home and suggested videos they are deﬁnitely seeing anFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-08
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 6 of 17Eric Sheridan
Carolyn Eversonopportunity to tell their story in a mobile environment which is incredibly important
to them.
I think the biggest surprise to me just in terms of ads I think about mobile over the
last 10 years, we talk about mobile advertising as always the shiny example of
walking past a retailer, getting zapped with an oﬀer and it was going to be geo-
relevant and you were going to walk into the store and get a discount. That's how
everybody talked about it.
I think what we missed as an industry is actually mobile is the most important brand
building platform now in the world because of the scale. Every single day we now
have over 1 billion people on our platform. You cannot build a brand without taking
advantage of mobile, there is no choice.
And that's every category, even the entertainment category. We have the largest
number of movie and TV fans aggregated in any one place. So even the
entertainment business is looking at Facebook and Instagram as the source of
building out their brand if they're launching a new show or a movie.
So the importance of mobile as a brand-building platform I think we underestimated
as an industry. And we're certainly seeing the migration to that.
{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
The other big opportunity that gets talked about a fair bit is small business. You have
45 million small business pages on Facebook against 2.5 million advertisers today.
And the team talks a lot about closing the gap and facilitating small business
reaching their customers. What are some of the hurdles, what are some of the
challenges that could lead to the opportunity of small business investing on
Facebook being realized over the next couple of years?
{BIO 15342167 <GO>}
Yes. So there's a certainly a gap between the number of business pages and the
number of advertisers that we have today. We're doing a number of things.
First and foremost, we know that small business owners are on Facebook on a
personal level. And many, there is still a high percentage of small businesses that
don't even have a website presence.
And so Facebook pages actually are becoming their presence in the mobile
environment. And they are not having to invest in building out a full website in the
desktop world. So we're deﬁnitely seeing that trend.
We try very hard to build self-serve tools for small businesses to be able to actually
start to advertise in a very seamless and easy way. The most used product for smallFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-08
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 7 of 17Eric Sheridan
Carolyn Eversonbusinesses is actually just to boost the post which is a very simple thing. If they are
making a post about an oﬀering or a new product or service they literarily can click
and with very, very not a lot of eﬀort they can actually add a little bit of a boost, pay
for that ad and see the accelerated reach and then we start to drive the business
from there.
So we see a huge opportunity for us to grow. I mean small businesses are incredibly
important not only because our consumers are connected to them and want to hear
from them. We also see that on Instagram almost 50% of people on Instagram,
which is now over 400 million people on a monthly basis, are connected to a
business.
So consumers clearly want to connect with businesses and want to have a presence
from them. We're also seeing a very signiﬁcant increase, it's 2X over last year with a
number of consumers that are communicating with businesses on Facebook pages.
Again what are the expectations? The expectations from consumers these days are
that they can interact with a business. They have access to it via email or a message
and they are very much feeling like this is much more of a personal relationship than
ever has before. And so our messaging between consumers and businesses has
grown dramatically in the last year.
{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
You've also been investing in new ad formats around direct response advertising. In
June you launched a test around buy buttons. You're expanding that now.
Maybe help us understand the social commerce concept. The idea of buy buttons,
what are you seeing from out in the ﬁeld from buy buttons and what are some of the
decisions you have to make about going wider with that initiative?
{BIO 15342167 <GO>}
So I think if we think about this holiday season and some of the best practices that
we're seeing marketers really implement, number one is that conversion pixel is
really understanding the behavior of consumers as they migrate between diﬀerent
places on the web and in the mobile department. The second product that has been
very successful is dynamic product ads.
And so just to explain what dynamic product ads are, you can take a let's say a
retailer and they can upload their entire product catalog. Then without having to
create individual ads for millions of products which some of these obviously these
retailers have millions of diﬀerent product oﬀerings, we can dynamically generate
the right product and the right ad to the person at the right time based on
potentially somebody leaving it in their shopping cart and they didn't purchase it or
they were browsing for a particular product.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-08
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 8 of 17Eric Sheridan
Carolyn EversonAnd it's even as sophisticated as knowing that maybe you did buy it so make sure
you don't show that product again because that would be a wasted ad. If you just
purchased something why do you need to see an ad for that again?
So dynamic product ads have been very, very eﬀective. In addition we have this
format called carousel ads which basically show up to ﬁve images or a video and it
allows marketers to take a single product and show it in very unique ways over the
course of ﬁve images.
You could show ﬁve diﬀerent products, you could tell a story, you could show a
couple of products with some news stories as background information for it. So the
combination of conversion pixel dynamic product ads and carousel ads has been
very, very eﬀective.
In terms of social commerce overall what we're really trying to do is actually facilitate
easier shopping between consumers and businesses. And mobile conversions
historically have been challenging. Think about what you have to do on a mobile
phone.
You have to often enter in all of your information, the screen is much smaller, you
have to put in your credit card, your address and it's cumbersome. So testing things
like the buy button, testing things like links on the pages for calls to action, testing
link ads that automatically update your information and send it to a small business,
those are all attempts on our part to really make the transaction easier between a
consumer and business.
It is clear that consumers discover products on Facebook from businesses, from their
friends. It is also clear that they would like to be able to buy them in a much more
simpler fashion and that's what we're trying to do.
{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Got it. Okay. One question that's coming through the crowd mics that I also wanted
to talk about his international monetization.
You look at your results and you clearly are monetizing engagement to a much
greater degree in North America and Western Europe and then as you move out of
more developed markets it seems like there's a huge opportunity around the
international monetization. Maybe talk a little bit about what the Company is doing
to address that long-term opportunity.
{BIO 15342167 <GO>}
Sure. So I just got back from India. I took my global leadership team to India, twice a
year I take them to markets that are incredibly important for us from a cultural
immersion perspective to learn how a product is being used and also to understand
the needs of the marketers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-08
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 9 of 17And so this is a very important area for us. So let me just start very broadly, there's
about 40% of people connected to the Internet today. That number diﬀers a little bit,
depending on the source you use it's about 40% which means there are over 4
billion people that are still not connected to the Internet.
And one of the things that we're most focused on is actually providing connectivity
to the people that don't have access. We are doing that through a number of fronts.
We are doing that through free basic services which is now available to 150 million
people that can't access it.
And the notion there is to get them onto the Internet with free access to data around
health, education, ﬁnancial services and over time they then will use additional apps.
We're doing things around satellite and we're launching an unmanned aircraft
vehicle in early 2016.
So we're very focused on trying to connect the rest of the world. It's core to the
mission of Facebook.
In terms of monetization we actually are seeing tremendous interest in those markets
from our large global marketers. So for example I'll take India since I was just there
last week. India is the second largest market for Facebook outside of the United
States, has about 138 million people using the platform.
Yet in India the population of 1.3 billion people, 1 billion people are still not
connected to the Internet and so we're in very early stages. However, what you're
seeing in India is really two forms of really interesting growth. You're seeing an
explosion of e-commerce.
India is very much they don't really allow traditional foreign direct investment for big-
box retailers. There is a ton of small business activity.
E-commerce, it's almost like they've skipped 10 to 15 years of what we did in terms of
growing the retail business. They've already moved to mobile commerce. And we sat
with many of those companies last week and they are seeing tremendous growth.
Then you take a more traditional CPG companies and auto companies and they are
seeing a market like India as their future market to get the next 1 billion consumers as
they grow economically and they have access to more of these services. So we are
deﬁnitely seeing a tremendous amount of interest in markets like that.
What we're doing on the monetization and product front is number one, you have to
recognize that the phones that we're all probably using and the tablets that we all
have in front of us today we have pretty good connection thanks to AT&T who was
just here and Verizon and others that have wired it for us. But the majority of these
markets are still living with 2G connections.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-08
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 10 of 17Eric Sheridan
Carolyn EversonSo we have Facebook Lite which is only uses 1 megapixel of data. So it's a very
lightweight version of Facebook so that can be used in 2G connections. We are
allowing people to make a post when they are oﬀ-line and then when they get into a
WiFi environment it uploads.
From a marketing perspective we're taking our traditional video product which uses
a lot of data. And we now have something called slideshow which Coca-Cola just
used in both Nigeria and Kenya. So they are basically able to show a video-like
product to more of a 2G feature phone connection.
We have click-to-missed call in India which is a very common behavior that
consumers literally click and the business calls them back so the consumer doesn't
have to pay for data. So it's really being mindful of what the product needs are in
those markets and being mindful of the connectivity challenges that consumers
have. And to build products and services that speak to that market, we're very
focused on that.
{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Okay. Just a reminder if you want to send questions to me up here on stage please
use the crowd mics app, hopefully it's on your phone. I've been given a fair bit of
questions around product and that's sort of where I wanted to go next.
It's been really busy year for Facebook on product. It almost seems like very few days
go by before we see new iterations around product from the Company. One of the
areas that's the most interesting to look from the outside in is video both as a user
on Facebook and what advertisers are trying to accomplish with video. Maybe talk
about how the video ad advertising side is evolving, what is sort of the conversation
like with advertisers just think about putting more money to work on video
advertising on Facebook?
{BIO 15342167 <GO>}
So today we have about 8 billion video views a day and 500 million people on
Facebook watch at least one video a day and that is growing very, very quickly. And
it's not surprising because there's an overarching trend in visual communication
that's being particularly driven by a millennial audience that believes that they're
living in a borderless world and they can communicate with people cross-border
and language becomes a barrier.
And so we see a huge explosion in photo and video sharing that obviously is driving
both Instagram and Facebook. And so video overall is a very beloved way to
communicate for consumers ﬁrst and foremost.
And we really focus on making sure the consumer product and the consumer usage
is delightful before we start thinking about how the ad products work into that.
Because one of your earlier questions was how do you balance consumer
engagement in ads. At the end of the day we have to deliver a valuable product toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-08
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 11 of 17consumers every single time they interact with our products and that's the ﬁrst and
most important thing that we do.
In terms of how marketers are thinking about video they are thinking about it in a
number of diﬀerent ways. First of all, the mobile environment is very diﬀerent than
their other environments that they have used video before. Often consumers are
watching mobile video with sound oﬀ initially.
And when I speak with marketers and ask is that in your creative brief, are you
thinking about how to use subtitles, hotels.com did a great, one of the ﬁrst marketers
to do it, where they have this character called Captain Obvious and he was playing
the piano and he pretended he was like an amazing piano player, meanwhile he
wasn't exactly but it was all subtitles. Why subtitles? Because if you're actually
engaged with it you might be more inclined to turn on the sound but sound oﬀ is a
consideration.
The interaction and the actual results from the ﬁrst 1 to 3 seconds are incredibly
important in a mobile environment, especially feed. If you just think about the use of
your thumb, we call it thumb stopping content, what is going to get a consumer to
stop their thumb and actually engage and those ﬁrst 1 to 3 seconds are really
important whereas in other environments you tend to have longer to build the story
arc. So that's another consideration that we're working with marketers on it.
In terms of length of video and how they're thinking about it, very few marketers are
just picking up their 30-second spots and putting them into the feed environment.
They are thinking much more thoughtfully about how to actually engage consumers
and tell stories sequentially.
So Macy's for example during this holiday season is using both Facebook and
Instagram. They're teasing short, very short videos around Believe which is their -- it
is a great wonderful sort of holiday story about children being able to write their
wish and having them come true.
They are very short videos that they are teasing and as they ﬁnd consumers
engaging with them then they are going to lead to a much longer 3-minute version
of the ﬁlm. We have the ability because of people-based marketing to start
something on your mobile device in the morning. If you engage with it we can then
send something back to you on your desktop if you're at desktop during the day.
If you're at home at night and you happen to be on a tablet we can then send
something else. So the notion of building sequential storytelling and video is
something that's very, very appealing to marketers.
So I would say we're in the early days of video. It's a beloved medium. Consumers
are clearly clamoring for it and using it more and more.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-08

Eric SheridanIt was really a major inﬂection point by the way in August 2014 with the ice bucket
challenge. When 440 million people around the world were consuming an ice
bucket video and uploading it and engaging, that almost taught the world how easy
it was to actually shoot a video and upload it. And from then on we saw tremendous
growth.
{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
And one of the key announcements you made around Adweek in September was to
enable TRP buying. And what does that mean for what video ad budgets and how
they might be, how that might change the narrative around video ad budgets being
deployed on Facebook around video?
{BIO 15342167 <GO>}
Right. So one of the biggest questions is there still a signiﬁcant amount of budgets
that still are spent in the TV environment. And when you look at the TV advertising
budgets versus mobile there is still a wide discrepancy.
Mobile is 25% of consumers' time, it is roughly 16% of budgets. TV has a very
signiﬁcant amount of marketers budgets. So what we were trying to ﬁgure out was
we knew that mobile video, particularly Facebook and Instagram, were very additive
to the TV reach story.
For example with millennials we add about 34% incremental reach as an example.
And we also know that reach is becoming more and more challenging in the TV
environment as the ratings have become more challenging outside of live events.
But yet there's a whole history of how agencies and marketers have bought TV.
They've bought it based on TRPs, total rating points. They've bought it using
processes and systems that have existed for decades. And so we had two choices.
We could say look, it's time to completely shift and you got to use all of these new
tools. Or we can build an on ramp to the future and say tell us what your total rating
point objective is, let's combine it with what you're doing on TV, add Facebook and
Instagram will be coming in early 2016 to the mix. And we made it much easier for
the agency and marketers to actually combine their TV and Facebook and Instagram
buy.
The reaction has been positive. It's still early, we only launched it in September. But
it's very much to be sort of a bridge to the future of where we think the marketer
needs to go.
{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Okay. You've referenced Instagram a few times. I know it's front of mind for investors
also.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-08
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 13 of 17Carolyn EversonEarlier this year you expended the ability to advertise on Instagram. Help us
understand what the long-term plan is with respect to Instagram, what the early days
have shown you about how advertisers are putting money to work on Instagram and
what that's doing for broader advertising budgets.
{BIO 15342167 <GO>}
Sure. So Instagram now is available globally as of September. It has over 400 million
people using the platform.
It is growing incredibly quickly from a user growth perspective. And marketers were
very eager to be able to do more on Instagram.
And why is that? When you take Facebook and Instagram you have the two most
important mobile ad platforms in the world in the majority of markets.
And so if you're a marketer again and you have to reach people you have to reach
them at a certain frequency, you have to engage with relevant content. Instagram
and Facebook are very, very powerful combined.
There are diﬀerences between how the two platforms are utilized. Instagram is a
place for visual inspiration. About 50% of the people are following businesses. So
there's deﬁnitely an interest.
But there's also a high percentage of people that follow people they don't know.
And that is because they are inspired by whatever they happen to be posting about.
I follow a lot of people that post about dogs because I have four of them and I
happen to like that. Whereas on Facebook you are connected to people you know or
have at least some degree of separation but they are in your network.
So the use cases are a little bit diﬀerent. But what we did do and it was really
important I think for us to do this. And the last time I did an investor meeting a
number of months ago we had not really built this yet, is we took the back of all of
the ad infrastructure of Facebook. So all of the targeting capabilities and
measurement capabilities, the self-serve, the API, working with Facebook marketing
partners to accelerate and to be able to have our partners sell Instagram we took all
of the infrastructure that we had built for Facebook and made it available on
Instagram.
And so now marketers can basically get the same level of targeting and
measurement that they were used to on Facebook. And frankly once we built it for
Facebook it sort of starts to become table stakes. Marketers expect the ability to use
those targeting capabilities and the measurement.
And so we're seeing a lot of interplay between the two platforms these days. As I
mentioned. And I referenced Macy's has done some fabulous work between the twoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-08

Eric Sheridanplatforms for the holiday season as has Target with their cartwheel app. And you can
actually interplay the two.
So as I said with a Macy's example they use the Marquis on Instagram which basically
is something that you get the dominant share of the advertising on Instagram for the
day that you use it. So they used it right before Black Friday. Based on who
interacted with that they then could retarget them not only on Instagram but also on
Facebook.
So we're seeing a lot of interplay between the two. And again marketers are very
excited to have two incredible platforms.

Well referencing the interplay between the two is interesting. Sheryl Sandberg on
the last earnings call mentioned that some of the advertising dollars that were
getting put to work on Instagram were incremental to Facebook, Inc. and some
weren't.
Maybe you could tease that out. Help investors understand the interplay of how ad
dollars are being put to work between Instagram, Facebook and how that might
evolve going forward.
{BIO 15342167 <GO>}
Yes. So we're still seeing that. There is nothing changed from what Sheryl said back
in the earnings call. What we're seeing right now is that marketers are increasing
their share of budget to the Facebook family.
They are trying to understand how much should be weighted towards Facebook and
Instagram. Some are saying let's take what we've done with Facebook, pull a little bit
of that oﬀ of Facebook, test it on Instagram. And you have to remember we're in the
early, early days of Instagram.
We have been very I think thoughtful about how we've rolled out advertising. It's just
been rolled out globally over the last couple of months. And marketers want to test
each platform for the beneﬁt of each platform and want to understand what actually
works on Instagram before they necessarily decide to accelerate.
The same token we have marketers, particularly in certain categories like the fashion
category, that have been waiting for Instagram to open up and are doing more on
Instagram initially than they are on Facebook. And so we're really learning between
the two over time what we want both platforms to be are the most important growth
drivers for businesses small to large. And we're going to keep innovating on the
products to make sure we get there.

Page 15 of 17Carolyn EversonOne of the things you referenced earlier was the Atlas transaction. You've talked a lot
about targeting capabilities.
Two other pivots you made at the backend on advertising was to acquire LiveRail
and also launched the Facebook Audience Network. Maybe talk a little bit about
what those assets do for Facebook broadly when marketers think about putting
money to work both on Facebook and oﬀ Facebook.
{BIO 15342167 <GO>}
So the strategy behind our ad tech investments is very much driven by our belief in
where marketing is going in the future which is personalized marketing at scale. So
we want every time a person experiences an ad on Facebook and Instagram for
them to feel like this was the most relevant ad at exactly the right time and it was the
most useful thing that could be served up to them.
Because the more we do that the better the experience is the more they come back
to the platforms and they feel that the advertising is additive. So that's at the core of
what we believe.
We also believe that digital advertising and mobile advertising in particular needs to
be improved across the ecosystem. It needs to drive better results, it needs to be
more relevant for consumers. So this is not something unique to Facebook and
Instagram.
We think all platforms actually could beneﬁt from better, relevant, more personalized
marketing. And so Audience Network has seen some really great success. It of
course adds supply to our overall auction.
It allows marketers that are not only doing great things on Facebook and Instagram
but to be able to access third-party apps, use native ads. It's driving very, very
eﬀective ROI for our clients.
LiveRail has over 90% accuracy in age and gender targeting compared to the
industry average of 31% to 35%. So LiveRail again utilizing Facebook data around
age and gender is a much more eﬀective in its targeting. And again we're trying to
solve what we think are industry challenges.
One industry challenge is cookies completely overestimate reach and underestimate
frequency. And marketers are very surprised when we show them the reports of their
cookie-based measurement and people-based measurement. They think they're
reaching women 18 to 34 and they ﬁnd out wow, I'm actually reaching a lot of men
that are 45 and above.
And that's like a shock to the system when that happens. And so we're trying to solve
more accurate targeting and more relevant messaging both on our platforms as well
as oﬀ.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-08

Got it. So as we wrap up maybe just one last broad question. You led with talking
about mobile.
We had the advertising forecasting panel here yesterday. They talked about another
big year for mobile.
When you think out to 2016 and you talk to most of the big players in advertising
and marketing, how are they thinking about mobile in 2015? And what are the big
objectives either for mobile or outside of mobile that marketers are trying to
accomplish in 2016?
{BIO 15342167 <GO>}
Mobile is again by far and away the most important development in marketing that
we will I think see in our careers. You take every category it's being impacted. So
take the political elections.
To date we've had 76 million people interact on election topics with over 1.5 billion
interactions, just through November 28 is the last data point that I received. Every
member of Congress is on Facebook. Every candidate is on.
Ben Carson has already come up with 240 diﬀerent ads. He answers questions on
Facebook every night.
This will be a mobile election. So starting there.
Travel industry estimates that there will be 25% more bookings on mobile than in
2015. So all of the travel clients that we're talking to are trying to understand that
shift. I could literally go vertical by vertical.
And so this is a change, we believe we don't even talk about the shift is happening.
We believe the shift has happened and now it's a question of how companies are
going to change their internal processes, adapt to the fact that this is now more
consumers are spending more time in a mobile than on TV. And that just happened
in the last few months that they are spending more time in mobile apps.
So this is a profound shift. It changes marketing and it changes business models.
And I think we're going to continue to talk about it for the next few years.
