{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
Good morning and welcome. We are so pleased that you could join us today. We've
got some really exciting product announcements to share with you as we all
continue to make our way through these diﬃcult times and face the challenges that
COVID-19 is causing in our communities around the world. It's so inspiring how
people everywhere have adapted, working remotely, learning from home and
gathering virtually to stay close to family and friends, and it's been gratifying to see
the important role our products have played in helping people come together carry
on and move forward. We know that life won't always be like this and we're all
looking forward to better days. Here, at Apple, we feel a deep responsibility to keep
innovating, to continue making products that enrich people's lives in meaningful
ways.
Today, we're focusing on two products that have played integral roles in people's
everyday lives, Apple Watch and iPad. Let's get started with Apple Watch. Apple
Watch revolutionized what a watch can do. If you think about it for over a 100 years,
the traditional watch really focused on just one thing, time. Today, it's incredible what
Apple Watch enables you to do right from your wrist. I use my Apple Watch and its
amazing features throughout the day. Before I go out in the morning, I check the
weather; at work, Apple Watch notiﬁes me with everything from messages to news
alerts and keeps me right on schedule. I'm doing my best to stay in shape, so it's
great that Apple Watch keeps track of my workouts and motivates me to close my
rings. When I get home, I use it to open the garage, unlock my door and turn on the
lights, and when I am ready to settle in, I use Apple Watch to stream my favorite
music. And it's so reassuring for millions of customers that Apple Watch has
introduced great health features like heart monitoring, cycle tracking and fall
detection and even the ability to take an ECG, no wonder, Apple Watch is the most
loved Watch in the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 2 of 16Jeﬀ WilliamsI love reading the many messages I get every day from Apple Watch users telling me
how the watch has changed and in some cases saved their lives, like Ray from Texas,
she had been experiencing pain in her stomach, but didn't think it was too serious.
When her Apple Watch alerted her to an elevated heart rate, she realized it really
was. She went to the ER where it was determined she was in septic shock. Ray got
immediate intervention but she could have died without that warning from her
Apple Watch. Or Enrique from Spain who is blind and uses his watch for everything
from speaking, to time, to reminding him when his appointments are, to calling taxis
and helping him keep ﬁt. For Enrique, his Apple Watch has become an essential part
of his day-to-day life. Now, I'd like you to meet a few more of these people and hear
their stories.
(Video Presentation)
I really love hearing those stories about how Apple Watch helps people and enriches
their lives, and healthcare providers, insurance companies, and businesses are also
seeing the beneﬁts of oﬀering Apple Watch. They know it can make a big diﬀerence
in the lives of their patients, customers and employees. Recently, the Mount Sinai
Health System in New York launched the new Warrior Watch Study. Using data from
Apple Watch, researchers are studying the impact of COVID on the psychological
well-being of front-line healthcare workers by identifying early signs of stress, while
also looking to predict infection before symptoms appear.
Singapore has one of the world's leading healthcare systems. This fall, Singapore will
become the ﬁrst country to leverage the beneﬁts of Apple Watch by oﬀering
incentives for people to use it to stay healthy and active. Apple Watch helps people
understand so much about their health and ﬁtness and to live a better day. This year,
we're going to take it even further. Here's Jeﬀ to tell you what's next. (Music Playing)
{BIO 16886071 <GO>}
Apple Watch has made a profound impact on so many of our customers' lives and
we continue to be inspired, and this year, watchOS 7 had several important health
features that take advantage of the powerful technology in Apple Watch. The new
sleep app uses the motion sensors to track your sleep, automatic hand-washing
detection recognizes the motion and sound when washing your hands and
encourage you to continue for the recommended 20 seconds and watchOS 7 now
uses your motion in heart rate to measure a lower range of VO2 max values.
Now the American Heart Association recommends routinely assessing cardio ﬁtness
levels and VO2 max is the most accurate way to capture this. The problem is it's
usually only measured in specialty clinics, but watchOS 7 can now measure a full
range of VO2 max which is a powerful predictor of your overall health and coming
later this year, you can receive a notiﬁcation if your VO2 max drops to those lower
levels. Each year, Apple Watch raises the bar adding new features and technology
that improve our lives. This year, Apple Watch takes another big leap forward and I
am excited to show it to you now.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

This is the new Apple Watch Series 6, the perfect combination of powerful features
and beautiful design. Series 6 is our most colorful lineup ever, there is a new blue
aluminum case, there's updated classic gold stainless steel ﬁnish, a new gray black
stainless steel color graphite, and for the ﬁrst time, a stunning new Apple Watch
product Red. Now on the inside, Series 6 is packed with incredible technology,
including a new health sensor that enables an amazing new capability. Let's take a
look.
(Video Presentation)
With Apple Watch Series 6, you can measure your blood oxygen right from your
wrist. The new health sensor in Series 6 turns red in infrared light on to your wrist
and measures the amount of light reﬂected back. Advanced algorithms use this data
to calculate the color of your blood which indicates the amount of oxygen present.
The new blood oxygen app lets you take a measurement in just 15 seconds. And
Series 6 also captures periodic background readings and stores them in your health
app, so if you wear your Apple Watch to bed, it can record background
measurements while you sleep.
I'll hand it over to Sumbul to talk more about blood oxygen and its importance to
your health.
{BIO 22291272 <GO>}
Blood oxygen saturation, also known as SVO2, is like a vital sign. It's a key
measurement that contains critical information about your breathing and circulation.
Apple Watch is already a powerful health tool with apps that measure heart rate and
heart rhythm and now adding blood oxygen brings another valuable health
measurement to users. Blood oxygen and pulse oximetry are terms that we've heard
a lot about during the COVID pandemic. As you breathe, your heart and lungs work
together to deliver oxygen throughout your body. Blood oxygen saturation is an
indication of how well this system is functioning and of your overall respiratory and
cardiac health, and pulse oximetry is how you measure it. Now the blood oxygen
app on Series 6 lets you measure your blood oxygen for ﬁtness and wellness
purposes from your wrist anywhere and at any time.
This is a great new tool for your overall well-being and to enable future medical
discoveries, we're launching three new health research studies to learn how
longitudinal blood oxygen measurements along with other health metrics from
Apple Watch can help manage conditions that aﬀect the heart and lungs. First, to
study how to better manage and control asthma using physiological signals from
Apple Watch or collaborating with the pulmonary experts at the University of
California Irvine and Anthem. Second, to learn more about how metrics including
blood oxygen can be used to manage heart failure we're partnering with one of the
largest research organizations in North America, the University Health Network and
the investigators at the University of Toronto. And ﬁnally, as we all continue to learnFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 4 of 16Jeﬀ Williamsmore about COVID and understand the interplay with inﬂuenza, we're partnering
with the investigators of the Seattle Flu Study and faculty from the University of
Washington School of Medicine. We will explore how changes in blood oxygen and
heart rate can be early signals of the onset of these respiratory conditions. So that's
the new blood oxygen feature, we're so excited to bring this important new health
capability to our users.
Now, back to Jeﬀ, to tell you more about the new Apple Watch Series 6.
{BIO 16886071 <GO>}
Whether you are measuring blood oxygen, making a phone call on your watch or
simply checking your activity rings, it's all made possible by Apple silicon. Inside
Series 6 is our sixth generation system in package. It's a purpose-built designed, it's
absolutely unique in the industry. It includes a high performance dual-core processor
based on the A13 Bionic in iPhone 11 but optimized for Apple Watch. The S6 is up to
20% faster than the previous generation. Series 6 also has great new features that
are perfect for when you're out and about. Let's get outside and take a look.
(Video presentation)
Because of its energy eﬃcient design, Series 6 has always on display. Again, easier
to read your watch in sunny days without having to wait for display, now it's 2.5 times
brighter outdoors when your wrist is down. Series 6 also features a new always-on
altimeter that provides continuous elevation throughout the day. So on your next
hike, you can see your elevation change in real time right on your watch face, and at
any time, no matter where you are, you can measure your blood oxygen saturation
right from your wrist.
Now let's talk about watch faces. The watch face is fundamental to the Apple Watch
experience and we are taking faces further this year. Starting with some great new
designs and we'd like to share them with you now.
(Video presentation)
In watchOS 7, we also gave developers new tools to build even more specialized
watch faces. So if you're into surﬁng, there is a watch face for that with apps, like
dawn patrol to check surf conditions or if you're into photography, there is a watch
face for that with apps like Leumi to help you track the sun's position or if you're a
healthcare provider, there's a watch face for that, with apps like Notable to see your
upcoming appointments. Watch faces have always been a great way to personalize
your Apple Watch. Another is interchangeable bands. Now, traditional watch bands
have a clasp or buckle and they are limited to a few preset sizes for ﬁt, well, today
we're excited to introduce something completely diﬀerent. We call it the Solo Loop.
The Solo Loop is remarkably simple, no clasp, no buckle, no overlapping parts, just
one continuous piece. Made from custom liquid silicone, the Solo Loop is
stretchable so you can easily slip it on and oﬀ your wrist. It looks great and it's
durable and it's swim-proof, so it can go anywhere. It's available in a range of sizes,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

Page 5 of 16Deirdre O'Brien
Jeﬀ Williamsso you can ﬁnd your most comfortable ﬁt, and it comes in 7 fantastic colors. This new
band style is so comfortable, we did another version called the braided Solo Loop,
it's made from a 100% recycled yarn that's meticulously braided with ultra-thin
Silicon threads and it will be available in ﬁve colors. We're also oﬀering a new take
on the leather band with the new leather linked with no loop back or clasp of any
kind, there are also great new updates for Apple Watch Nike with ﬁve new sport
band and Sport Loop colors, plus a new Nike watch face and for Apple Watch
Hermes, we are introducing the new Attelage band in both single tour and doublet
tour.
That's Apple Watch Series 6, the most advanced Apple Watch ever.
We think you're going to love all the amazing new features. This year, we're doing
two additional things to make Apple Watch available to even more people. And the
ﬁrst is an entirely new way for families to use Apple Watch and here's Deirdre to tell
you all about it.
Apple Watch is essential for staying connected to those you love, whether that's a
child or an older adult. Right now, Apple Watch needs to pair with an iPhone, which
something they might no have. This is why we are excited to introduce Family Setup.
With Family Setup, you can use your iPhone to pair watches for your children or
older members in your household who don' t have their own phones, and they will
have their own phone number and account. Let me show you how it works.
Family Setup enables greater independence for your kids or older parents, and you
have the comfort of knowing they're just a call away. You get the safety and
communication features that technology can deliver in a device that can be
managed responsibly, for example, you can specify which contacts your kids can
communicate with when using messages and more, and you can set up automatic
location notiﬁcations, so whether it's grandma's house, school or basketball practice,
you will get the reassurance your child is exactly where you expect them to be. To
help them stay active, kids can now track movements and use all the other great
features of activity and workout in a way that works best for them. Kids can create a
Memoji with just their watch and share the stickers and messages or in the new
Memoji watch face. Whether they're learning at home or in the classroom, the new
school-time mode helps kids stay focus with do not disturb, restricted interaction
and this distinctive look which teachers or parents can recognize at a glance.
These are just some of the ways Family Setup provides kids and older adults with the
powerful and unique beneﬁts of Apple Watch even if they don't have an iPhone.
Family Setup requires a cellular model of Apple Watch Series 4 and later and will be
available at launch with these carrier partners in these regions around the world with
more coming later this year. And that's Family Setup. Back to Jeﬀ.
{BIO 16886071 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 6 of 16Lisa JacksonWe think Family Setup will keep families more connected, giving kids greater
independence and agency and you more peace of mind. The second thing we're
doing to make Apple Watch available to even more people is to create a new model
that combines elements of Series 6 design with the most essential features of Apple
Watch all at a more aﬀordable price. We call it Apple Watch SE. Apple Watch SE has
the features customers love. It has everything you need to stay connected, be more
active and keep an eye on your health, and like Series 6, Apple Watch SE uses our
largest and most advanced watch display allowing you to see so much more at a
glance, more information and apps on your watch face, more in messages, calendar
and maps and larger and easier to read metrics while you're working out, and for
fast access to information in apps, Apple Watch SE uses the S5 chip for up to 2 times
faster performance than Series 3, and staying connected is even easier with the
cellular models, which allow you to make phone calls and messages and more even
without your phone and with Family Setup, cellular models of Apple Watch SE will
also be great for kids.
Customers love using Apple Watch for ﬁtness and working out and Apple Watch SE
has the same accelerometer, gyroscope, compass and altimeter as Series 6, and
because it has the latest motion sensors, Apple Watch SE also supports fall
detection, a feature that's made a lifesaving diﬀerence for many Apple Watch
wearers. With all of these features and more including the new capabilities in
watchOS 7, we think Apple Watch SE will be the perfect watch for many new
customers. Apple Watch SE starts at just $279. In addition, we're announcing Apple
Card ﬁnancing for Apple Watch, so customers can easily pay across 24 monthly
payments, Apple Watch Series 6 with a breakthrough new blood oxygen sensor
starts at just $399 and Series 3 continues at its great entry price of just $199. With
three great Apple Watch models to choose from, there really is an Apple Watch for
everyone.
Now let's talk about what Apple Watch is doing to protect the environment. Apple's
commitment to the environment spans everything we do, from how we design our
products, to the materials that go in them, to how they're manufactured, and here's
Lisa to share some of the many things Apple is doing to reduce our environmental
footprint.
{BIO 7568663 <GO>}
We are proud that all of our corporate operations worldwide are carbon-neutral and
we've done it by replacing dirty energy with clean renewable power. All of our
oﬃces, retail stores and data centers run on 100% renewable energy. We're also
proud that we've cut our comprehensive carbon footprint by 35% since 2015, and
you may have heard, we are now taking our environmental commitment even further,
starting with a promise, by 2030, Apple will be 100% carbon-neutral for our entire
end-to-end footprint including our supply chain and products. To keep our promise,
we're focusing on not just the energy we use, but the materials needed to make our
products.
Let's take a look at Apple Watch. Beginning last year, our aluminum watch cases are
made with 100% recycled aluminum, and for Series 6, we're now using 100%FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 7 of 16Jeﬀ Williams
Jay Blahnikrecycled rare earth elements and Tungsten in the Taptic engine. And we go to great
lengths to make sure our products are free of harmful chemicals. Like all of our
products, Apple Watch is free of BFR, PVC, beryllium and mercury and the display
glass is made without arsenic. And all of the ﬁber in our packaging comes from
recycled sources responsibly managed forests. Sometimes it's not what we make but
what we don't make that counts. We know that customers have been accumulating
USB power adapters and that producing millions of unneeded adapters consumes
resources and adds to our carbon footprint. So this year, we are removing the USB
power adapter from Apple Watch. We're also helping our Apple Watch
manufacturing partners transition to renewable energy, that combined with
removing the power adapter will result in eliminating the carbon equivalent of over
50,000 cars from our roads per year. We have lots more to do and we'll have lots
more to share in the months and years to come.
Now, back to Jeﬀ.
{BIO 16886071 <GO>}
These actions are signiﬁcant and lasting and I'm proud of the great work Apple is
doing to protect our planet. So that's our lineup. Apple Watch Series 6 with the new
blood oxygen sensor, the most advanced Apple Watch yet. And the very capable
and aﬀordable Apple Watch SE, you can order both today and availability starts this
Friday.
To celebrate the launch of the new Apple Watch Series 6, we created a video to
show you just how far the watch has come and here it is.
(Video Presentation)
Since the beginning, one of the most profound impacts Apple Watch has had it's
helping people be more active. We've been working on something that will motivate
and inspire you even more on your ﬁtness journey, and here's Jay to tell you all
about it.
Being more active is one of the most important things we can do for our health. So
over the years, we've built a range of features on the Apple Watch designed to
motivate a wide variety of users. We hear from people who have become healthier
just by closing their activity rings each day and friends and family who are able to
motivate each other and stay connected even from far away with activity sharing, and
then there are most competitive Apple Watch users who love earning awards and
challenging each other to get ﬁt.
One of the Apple Watch's most popular apps is the Workout App which has been
ﬁnely tuned with powerful algorithms that accurately track the most important
metrics for all the workouts you do. This year, we wanted to push the Apple Watch
workout experience even further. So we are creating amazing workouts withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

built around Apple Watch, and we'd like to show it to you now.
(Video Presentation)
Introducing Apple Fitness+, a new service for Apple Watch designed to inspire you
to get ﬁt and stay ﬁt. The entire Fitness+ experience is powered by the Apple Watch
in some really cool ways. Let's take a look at how it works. Apple Watch owners love
seeing all of the metrics right from their wrist during the workout. The watch's
sensors make it possible to see your heart rate, calories burnt, pace and distance.
And that data helps keep you motivated and on track, which is awesome. With
Fitness+ you simply choose the workout you want to do from the catalog of videos
on your iPhone, iPad or Apple TV, and when you start the video, it automatically
starts the correct workout in your Apple Watch Workout App, and it sends those
metrics in real time right to the screen you're viewing the workout.
So you have all of your data on your wrist and on the screen in front of you and your
metrics come to life, to keep you motivated. For example, when the trainer reminds
you to check your heart rate, your numbers get larger, making it easy to see the
details you need. When you're in the middle of a tough interval, you see a
countdown timer to motivate you to push through every last second. Your activity
rings are also right on the screen, so you can see how your workout is helping you
make progress towards closing your rings for the day. And if you happen to close
one of your rings in the middle of your workout, you won't miss celebration. You'll
see it in real time and right on the screen. When the workout is over, you get a
comprehensive summary. And all of that data captured from your watch's sensors is
shown right on the summary screen, calories burnt, average heart rate, distance,
pace, even your current activity rings. Of course, there is a lot more to the
experience,
Fitness+ is launching with the most popular workout types. So there is something for
everyone, yoga, cycling, dance, treadmill walk and treadmill run, strength, core, hit,
growing and even mindful cool downs. You can do the workouts with any brand of
equipment and many of the workouts require just a set of dumbbells or no
equipment at all. Of courser, you can do them wherever it's convenient for you, at
home, the gym, outside, or even when you're traveling. We think the ﬂexibility to do
the workout you love when you want and where you want makes Fitness+ the perfect
workout companion. Each week, our incredible trainer team will deliver a wide
variety of workouts from the Fitness+ studio to help keep you engaged. That's fresh
new workouts every week across a range of times and instructors. And of course, the
trainers will have the best music to keep you motivated whatever your musical taste
is from latest hits and hip-hop to Latin grooves and top country.
And if you're also an Apple Music subscriber, it's easy to save the playlist from
Fitness+ and then listen to them later in Apple Music whether you're working out or
not. And if you're brand new to ﬁtness or it's been a while since you worked out,
there is an absolute beginner program built right in. The program will help you get
started, learn the basics of movement and ﬁtness and get you safely ready for theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

the center tab, and you can access the same workouts from the new ﬁtness app on
your iPad and Apple TV.
To quickly get to your next best workout, you'll ﬁnd recommendations personalized
just for you, intelligent suggestions will make it easy to ﬁnd what you like and also
encourage you to discover new trainers and new workouts to balance out your
routine, and that's Fitness+. You get 10 diﬀerent types of studio workouts, so there is
something for everyone, incredible music built into each workout to keep you
moving and the world's best trainers, whether you work out every single day, want to
add a little more ﬁtness to your life or you just want to get started. We think Fitness+
is going to take your workouts to the next level with convenience, expert coaching
and inspiration, and it's all powered by Apple Watch.
As with all of Apple's products and services, we've designed Fitness+ with privacy in
mind. All your Fitness+ workout recommendations are powered using on device
intelligence and when using Fitness+, neither calories nor the workouts and trainers
you choose will be stored along with your Apple ID. The price is $9.99 per month or
just $79.99 for a whole year and your family will also be able to enjoy Fitness+ for no
additional charge. Fitness+ will be available in these countries at launch. The service
will be available before the end of the year, and for those purchasing a new Apple
Watch, you get Fitness+ free for three months to help make 2021 your ﬁttest and
healthiest year ever. And now I'd like to hand it over to Lori to share some more
exciting news about our services.
Apple's Fitness+ joins our collection of world-class subscription services that enrich
our customers' lives. These are services that so many of us and our families use every
single day and we want to make it easy for everyone to discover and enjoy them. So

Now let's turn our attention to iPad. I love my iPad because it is such an incredibly
versatile device, powerful and easy to use, it enables all of us to do so many
meaningful things every day. And now more than ever, iPad has become even more
important keeping us close to the ones we love when we can't be there in person,
helping students learn remotely, helping people express and share their creativity,
reshaping how the world communicates, and iPad is providing a critical lifeline for
doctors, nurses and patients. it's versatility is what makes iPad such an essential
device. With the power OF the App Store and over a million iPad apps, the iPad can
do whatever you needed to do.
We are inspired to see how iPad's impact has been felt across the world. This year
marks the 10 years since we shipped our very ﬁrst iPad, and in that time, it has
become one of the most successful consumer electronics products ever. We've now
sold over 500 million iPads to customers around the world. And more and more new
customers are just discovering iPad for the very ﬁrst time. In fact, more than half of
our iPad customers are buying their very ﬁrst iPad. That's just incredible. And users
love their iPads. iPad has been ranked number one in customer satisfaction for 10
straight years, every year since it launched. Our users are doing more than ever with
iPad. So we continue to push iPad forward. This is a big year for iPad. Earlier this year,
we made some great updates to the iPad Pro including the A12Z chip, new Pro
camera system, LiDAR scanner and so much more. Today, we are updating the rest of
our full-size iPad line-up starting with most popular iPad and here's Ted to tell you
more about it.
We are incredibly proud of the role that iPad is playing in the lives of so many
people. Users love our iPad seventh generation because it delivers a beautiful 10.2
inch Retina display, with support for Apple pencil and the full-sized smart keyboard
on a thin, light and aﬀordable design, and our customers love all the things they can
do with it from taking notes as they learn something new, to playing their favorite
game.
So this year, we're taking its beloved design and cranking up the performance with
this, the new iPad eighth generation, it's more capable than ever and it starts with the
A12 Bionic. This chip is a powerhouse. It features a powerful CPU and Superfast GPU.
Compared to the already fast chip in last year's iPad, it has a 40% faster CPU and
delivers a massive two times jump in graphics. This extra performance is great for
everything from working with high-resolution content to immersive gaming
experiences, and compared to the competition over the last year, it's not even close.
This new iPad with the A12 Bionic is up to two times faster than the top-selling
Windows laptop. It's up to three times faster than the top selling Android tablet and
it's up to a whopping six times faster than the top-selling Chromebook. iPad leavesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 11 of 16the competition in the dust and all that power is delivered in a thin and light design
that's super portable with great cameras and all-day battery life.
Now our A-series chips are more than a CPU and GPU. They include powerful
custom technologies like the neural engine for machine learning which comes to our
most popular iPad for the very ﬁrst time. It's capable of processing up to 5 trillion
operations per second and it powers some magical experiences on iPad like
allowing you to instantly transform the color of your photos or even analyze your
tennis game and provide real-time stats like ball speed and body positioning.
Altogether, the A12 Bionic takes performance to the next level and makes iPad more
powerful than ever.
Now let's talk about accessories. They expand the versatility of iPad. iPad 8th Gen
works with the full-sized smart keyboard and keyboards from large tech like the
combo touch with track pad and the rugged combo, that's so important for schools,
and of course, this new iPad works with one of our most beloved accessories, Apple
pencil, with its incredible precision and low latency plus features like pressure
sensitivity and tilt, it's the gold standard for creativity and enables artists to bring
their vision to life, and we've seen it become an essential tool to Journal and take
detailed notes. We are blown away by what we've seen people create with Apple
pencil on iPad. There's really nothing else like it.
And taking the Apple pencil experience to a whole new level is iPadOS 14 which
adds powerful new pencil capabilities and other new features as well. Let's see it in
action.
IPadOS 14 makes iPad even more intuitive, fun and productive because you can get
your work done just about anywhere. Hand written text is just as powerful as typed
text, iPad OS even understands what you write, letting you take quick actions with
just a tap. As you sketch, shape recognition helps you draw perfect circles, stars and

IPad 8th generation with its huge boost in performance and incredible features in
iPadOS 14 will enable even more people to do more amazing things and that's not
all, as I told you, we're updating our entire full-sized lineup so that brings us to iPad
Air. iPad Air was designed to deliver Pro features at a very aﬀordable price and today
we are thrilled to introduce an all new completely redesigned iPad Air.
And here, it is.
(Video Presentation)
This is the new iPad Air and to tell you all about it. I'd like to hand it over to the Laura.
The new iPad Air starts with a gorgeous design. The all new thin and light enclosure
and narrow border design features a beautiful all screen display. Each element of
iPad Air is meticulously crafted from the precisely machine top button to the scope,
the detail around the camera. And the new iPad Air design comes in ﬁve core just
colors, including a new rose gold, green, sky blue ﬁnish. Our customers are going to
love these colors, and this new design features stunning Liquid Retina display. In the
same footprint as the previous Air, the new iPad Air features a larger 10.9-inch Liquid
Retina display with the resolution of 2360 by 1640, that's over 3.8 million pixels for
extra crisp text and photos. And it has advanced display technologies like full
elimination, white color, True Tone and an anti-reﬂective coating that combined
deliver an amazing visual experience.
To give our customers is beautiful all screen design and then ﬁnding a new home for
one of the most popular features, touch ID. So we designed a next generation touch
ID and integrated it right into the top button. This provides convenient and secure
authentication while allowing the display to extend on all sides. This is the smallest
authentication sensor we have ever design and it delivers the same performance,
ease of use and security you know and trust from touch ID. The technology under the
button is really amazing. It uses a sapphire crystal lens and next generation custom
sensor that more eﬃciently captures the details of a ﬁngerprint and it uses a faster
Secure Enclave to more quickly authenticate the ﬁngerprint data and using it is as
simple as ever, just touch the top button into our iPad, log in to apps or use Apple
Pay, it's fast easy and secure.
Another reason customers love iPad Air is its performance. So we're debuting an
incredibly powerful new chip which is going to give the new Air a huge leap inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
I am super excited to tell you about the powerful new chip, we've built into the new
iPad Air, our latest A SERIES processor A14 Bionic. Our goal is to build chips with
industry-leading performance powerful, custom technologies and extremely eﬃcient
use of energy to make every one of our products best in class. One way we do this
by aggressively adopting cutting edge silicon process technology year after year.
And now with A14 we'll be the ﬁrst in the industry to use the breakthrough 5-
nanometer process technology, incredibly small scale of this process challenges the
laws of physics, in fact, we're talking about a scale so small that the dimensions of
these 5-nanometer transistors are measured in atoms.
This means we were able to pack 11.8 billion transistors into A14. That's an increase of
nearly 40% over our 7-nanometer chip, we use these additional transistors to deliver
new features, increased power eﬃciency and increased performance in nearly every
aspect of the chip. A14 Bionic includes a big update to our CPU. Our architecture
runs more instructions in parallel, resulting in great performance and lower power
and integrates large high performance caches size to meet the needs of the most
demanding applications. For A14's powerful new 6 core design, this results in an
enormous 40% increase in CPU performance compared to the previous iPad Air. A14
also features our newest GPU architecture scale to deliver the maximum sustainable
performance at the lowest possible power, an approach that also allows us to deliver
industry-leading peak performance when it's needed most.
For A14, our new four core design delivers a 30% increase in graphics performance
as well and when you compare the new iPad Air with A14 to the best selling laptop
and its price range a device nearly 3 times thicker and 4 times heavier, the new iPad
Air has up to two times faster graphics performance in its incredibly thin and light
design.
So for customers using iPad Air for performance intensive apps like editing 4K
videos creating works (inaudible) or playing immersive games incredible
performance of A14 can handle them all with ease. In addition to the blazing fast
CPU and GPU, A14 is loaded with customer technologies that drive the unique iPad
experience like a much faster Neural Engine, which will make iPad Air more powerful
for machine learning by doubling the number of cores to build a 16 core
architecture, the neural engine in A14 is capable of executing an amazing 11 trillion
operations per second.
This increases ML performance by up to 2 times over the previous generation. In
addition, our CPU is further optimized with second generation machine learning
accelerators, which come to iPad for the ﬁrst time and accelerate the matrix
multiplication frequently used in ML computations at up to 10 times faster than the
previous Air.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 14 of 16Laura LegrosNow the combination of the new Neural Engine, the CPU ML accelerators and our
high performance GPU deliver breakthrough machine learning capabilities to
elevate apps built on Core ML to an entirely new level of performance. So that's the
new A14 Bionic, it delivers big performance updates for the CPU and GPU, makes
iPad Air much more powerful for machine learning and also features the latest ISP for
higher quality videos and photos and even faster Secure Enclave for touch ID.
This is by far the most advanced chip we've ever made and we're thrilled to bring it
to the new iPad Air. Now back to you, Laura.
Wow, the A14 is a hugely forward and performance and we worked with a number of
developers to see what they can do with the new iPad Air. So let's take a look.
(Video Presentation)
With the A14 chip, the new Air is going to bring incredible performance to customers
looking to step up to a more powerful iPad and there is more. Another great feature
we're bringing to iPad Air is USB-C. USB-C increases data transfer speeds up to 5
gigabits per second, that's a tenfold jump in performance over the previous Air. It
provides a fast connection to a host of external devices like cameras, drives and
external monitors of the 4K. The new Air also includes great cameras front and back,
the front 7 megapixel FaceTime HD camera supports Smart HDR, improved 1080p
video capture and better low light performance for really high quality video calls.
And on the back is the same 12 megapixel camera used in the iPad Pro with focus
pixels and a larger aperture to capture incredibly sharp photos and stunning 4K
video, enhanced with improved video stabilization. So the photos and videos our
customers take with the new Air are going to look better than ever. And to elevate
the audio experience, we've redesigned the speaker system providing stereo audio
and landscape mode great for kicking back and enjoying your favorite movies and
TV shows.
The new Air also works with our amazing accessories including Apple pencil which
attaches magnetically to the side for pairing, charging and storage and the beautiful
Magic keyboard with ﬂoating design and built-in track pad. So this is the new iPad
Air featuring a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display, next-generation touch ID, a huge
boost in performance with A14 Bionic USB-C, advanced cameras, WiFi 6 and LTE
that's 60% faster.
This is by far the most powerful iPad Air ever. Let's check it out.
