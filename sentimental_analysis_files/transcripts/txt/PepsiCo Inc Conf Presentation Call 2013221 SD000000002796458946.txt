Presentation
Before we get started with our next presenter, PepsiCo, just one housekeeping note,
we will have a brief -- a bit of Q&A here in this room but there will be no breakout
session afterwards; PepsiCo management will be available for a Q&A at lunch. And
we want to make sure that we exit this room promptly because Avon needs to come
in here during the lunch period to do their rehearsals.
So with that ﬁrst, please join me in thanking Pepsi for sponsoring lunch today and
also beverages this week. And it is an incredibly exciting time at Pepsi. The Company
has made signiﬁcant progress on its strategy to re-accelerate growth. I want to thank
Chief Financial Oﬃcer, Hugh Johnston, for coming down to spend time with us
today. Hugh, I will turn it over to you.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you, Brian. Good morning, everyone; pleasure to be here with you all
today. With me are Brian Cornell who leads PepsiAmericas' foods businesses. And
Jamie Caulﬁeld known to all of you, our Head of Investor Relations. Brian happened
to be in South Florida this week and out in the market and we thought we would
take advantage of the opportunity to have him come in and spend some time with
you and answer some Q&A both in the session and out at lunch as well.
I'm going to share a short presentation on PepsiCo with you this morning and then
we will open it up to your questions from the ﬂoor. Once we wrap it up in here, as
Brian noted, we will join you for lunch where we will have some time to talk about
our business and enjoy some PepsiCo products prepared in what I think you will ﬁnd
to be some really creative ways.
Before I begin please make take note of our safe harbor statement which can also be
found on our Investor website under the Investors tab. So let's jump into it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-21
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 2 of 18As we look at PepsiCo today we do feel we are very well positioned. We generate
$65 billion in annual revenue, we are the second largest food and beverage business
globally, which provides us signiﬁcant scale advantages. We just completed a year in
which we generated 5% organic revenue growth.
We have very attractive operating margins and returns on net invested capital, each
of which stand now at about 15%. And our businesses are big cash generators, which
enables us to provide attractive cash returns to shareholders through dividends,
where our yield today is approximately 3%. And through a healthy share repurchase
program.
We compete in categories with attractive growth, margins and returns. Both the
snacks and the beverage categories are projected to generate global growth of
about 5%.
Our core businesses of convenient food and beverages are fairly evenly balanced
with about half our revenue coming from each and our core categories are highly
complementary. They not only share common consumers and customers. But they
also share resources and capabilities like agri sourcing, R&D capabilities, packaging,
ﬂavoring, go-to-market systems and back oﬃce functions.
And we are well-positioned within our categories with a clear number one global
position in salty snacks and a strong number two global position in beverages with
leadership or parity in a number of important markets.
We have a product portfolio that is really quite broad, it cuts across day parts, age
groups, need states and occasions providing almost limitless opportunities to
address consumers' evolving needs. And our businesses will continue to beneﬁt
from global mega trends alike on the go lifestyles, a rapidly growing middle class in
emerging and developing markets and consumers seeking a repertoire of products
that spans from fun for you all the way to good for you.
We also have a powerful brand portfolio that connects with consumers. 22 of our
iconic brands have retail sales surpassing the $1 billion, a number that has doubled
over the last 12 years. And like our products, these brands stand for everything from
fun for you to good for you.
Our brands typically have the number one or number two position in their respective
categories. In fact, Lay's Banner Sun is the number one global food brand overall
and Pepsi is the number two global beverage brand in the liquid refreshment
beverage category. And we have another 40 or so brands that are between $250
million and $1 billion of retail sales and that provides a great pipeline for the creation
of our future $1 billion brands.
To give you some perspective on the power of our brands, let me share with you an
interesting chart. Here are the 40 largest CPG brands in the US. So not only for food
and brokerage but also for HPC. We have nine of the top 40 trademarks and weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-21
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 18have four of the top 10 trademarks. This shows both the importance of the categories
we compete in and how well-positioned we are in these important categories. We
are an integral partner to our customers because our success is directly linked with
their success.
We also have a truly global footprint with presence in more than 200 countries. Over
a third of our revenue now comes from fast-growing emerging and developing
markets, or over $22 billion. Across our markets from emerging to developed we
have tremendous go-to-market reach which is largely enabled by the DSD systems
we have developed and optimized over the many decades.
Our systems are uniquely tailored to suit local market dynamics so that we can
eﬃciently and eﬀectively reach millions of points of distribution and billions of
consumers every single day. Our geographic diversity also acts as a sort of natural
hedge against regional volatility around the world.
Our geographic mix also gives us lots of runway to grow because the consumption
of our products grows as GDP per capita grows. In fact, there is a sweet spot
between $10,000 and $20,000 of GDP per capita where the rate of adoption and
frequency and purchase of our products both in snacks and beverages really starts
to accelerate. So as we look at our geographic portfolio there are a number of
markets that today are in this sweet spot fueling the growth that we see today.
Just as importantly, there are many markets that have yet to enter that sweet spot
and they represent tremendous future growth potential for PepsiCo.
To demonstrate, this chart shows salty snack per capita consumption of a number of
our key markets with Mexico at the top followed by Brazil, Russia, China and India.
Each of these market's per capita consumption is indexed to Mexico's level. So even
with a doubling of per caps in India, China, Russia or Brazil, these market's
consumption levels will still be far below where Mexico is today.
And just as importantly, we have a strong leadership position in each of these
markets which positions us well to capture the lion's share of the growth that will
occur in the categories.
On top of these considerable advantages, in 2012 we strengthened our business
across a variety of areas by focusing intently on ﬁve key priorities -- increasing our
brand support; stepping up our innovation; improving our marketplace execution;
driving greater productivity and eﬃciency; and driving cash ﬂow. Let me comment
brieﬂy on each of these beginning with brand support.
In 2012 we took a number of important steps to increase our brand support; ﬁrst we
increased the overall level of brand investment by 50 basis points from 5.2% of sales
to 5.7% of sales. At the same time we increased the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of
our investment. We focused our spend on 12 mega brands leveraging the scale and
heft of these biggest brands.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-21
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 4 of 18We directed more of our spend activities that are directly consumer facing, shifting
money from nonworking to working A&M by rationalizing the number of agency
partnerships and by leveraging and coordinating our creative and production costs
on a global basis for our global brands.
And ﬁnally, we improved the way we measure our return on A&M investment by
better tracking our consumer equity scores and how they respond to our marketing
activities. We also leverage social media to connect in a deeper way with our
consumers.
For example, we continued our highly successful Crash the Super Bowl Doritos
campaign, asking our passionate Doritos consumers to submit ads in a competition
where consumers also select the ﬁnalist spots to air during the Super Bowl. Over the
course of the contest history we received more than 22,000 consumer created
Doritos ads with winners consistently ranking in the top ﬁve of the USA Today's ad
meter.
The creator of this year's top ranked entry won the opportunity to work on the next
installment of the blockbuster Transformers movie with director Michael Bay. Even in
its seventh year Crash the Super Bowl continues to generate tremendous buzz,
consumer engagement and great advertising.
We further leveraged social media recently with the highly successful execution of
our Do Us a Flavor campaign. This concept actually originated with our UK snacks
business. The program invites consumers to submit proposals for new potato chip
ﬂavors in the UK under our Walkers brands and in the US under our Lay's brand.
Following its great success in the UK we ran Do Us a Flavor in 17 markets and, as I just
mentioned, ran it in the US very recently. The results in the US were well above our
expectations. We received more than 3.8 million consumer proposals in the US alone
and over the 17 markets we have received 19 million consumer proposals globally.
And we have improved the execution in our global sports properties as well. We
have a terriﬁc stable of (league) protein and college sports properties. We are doing
more to better leverage these great equities across our stable of brands. A good
example was our activation around the Super Bowl with the NFL where we had tie-
ins with Pepsi, with Doritos and with Quaker.
The other area to drive execution from national mass media to local in-store
presence. So with local team properties we are driving very localized in-store POS to
connect our consumers' passions for their favorite teams with our brands. And for
brands like Pepsi we are taking it a step further as we are ﬁnding interesting
intersections between the sports and the music categories, the heart of pop culture.
For example, we coordinated our global partnership with Beyonce with our
sponsorship of the Super Bowl half-time show, the perfect linkage of sports and
music on a huge platform.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-21
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 5 of 18Secondly, we stepped up our game in innovation by bringing to market a broad
array of oﬀerings from line extensions that bring additional frequency to our existing
products to new product platforms that capture new occasions by meeting
previously unmet needs. We've made progress with both the number and breadth of
these new product platforms and these typically have greater staying power and
oﬀer the opportunity for consistent growth over a number of years.
For example, in just the last year or so we've introduced Doritos Locos Tacos where
we sold more than 325 million taco shells -- it's 325 million taco shells -- contributing
to the most successful product launch in Taco Bell's 50 year history and expanded
our presence in the foodservice channel. We are gearing up for year two of our
Doritos partnership with Taco Bell with even more exciting new products.
Quaker Real Medleys was a convenient high-quality oatmeal with real fruit and real
nuts which was just named the breakfast product of the year for 2012.
Another example, Pepsi Next which delivers real cola taste with 60% less sugar and
achieved nearly $150 million in estimated retail sales in its ﬁrst year.
Starbucks Refreshers, a 60 calorie sparkling beverage that provides the delicious
boost of natural energy from green coﬀee extract and real fruit juice.
Tropicana 50, with 50% less calories, continues to perform well in the US when it was
launched in 2011. And we just recently launched it in the UK and are slowly taking it
around the globe.
And Gatorade Chews, a convenient form of carb energy to fuel athletes prior to
athletic competition.
So as we look at our innovation we feel very good about the new products that we
launched in 2012 and we are encouraged by the pipeline of innovation that we have
for 2013 and beyond.
The third area we have strengthened is our execution. For example, in North America
we continue to drive cross category in-store programs to increase the frequency with
which our snack and beverage products are purchased in the same basket. And
these numbers continue to improve. As a result we widened our salty snack
advantage in co-purchases from 2 points in 2011 to 4 points in 2012 and our
advantage in beverages from 2 points in 2011 to 3 points in 2012.
The fourth area, an area of tremendous focus for us in 2012, was productivity. We
executed a comprehensive restructuring program and accelerated our productivity
eﬀorts across the value chain -- how we make, move and sell our products. We
delayered the organization and improved eﬃciency. We reduced our headcount and
we rationalized our supply chain to reduce cost and investment in ﬁxed assets.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-21
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 18As a result of these eﬀorts we delivered in excess of $1 billion in productivity in 2012,
double our previous rate. And we will continue to drive productivity across the entire
value chain for all of our businesses.
We have a robust pipeline of projects from leveraging best-in-class supply-chain
activities around the world to increasing automation across the value chain, from raw
materials handling through to the route truck to implementing new processing
technologies that enable us to both increase asset utilization and reduce input costs.
Much of our productivity initiative is enabled by the IT investments that we've made
over the last several years giving us greater visibility into our performance metrics
across the globe. The sum of these changes from small actions repeated millions of
times to utilizing new technology that substantively changes the overall cost of key
processes gives us high conﬁdence that we will achieve our three-year $3 billion
productivity target through to 2014.
That said we are not stopping with the $3 billion current productivity program. We
have a deeply embedded productivity culture and we are already beginning to work
by to identify the next big tranche of productivity for all of our businesses.
And our ﬁfth focus in 2012 was cash ﬂow and returns; we delivered very strong cash
performance for the year. We reduced our cash conversion cycle by nine days. We
managed capital spending to 4% of sales, well within our long-term target and 20%
below our 2011 level. We delivered management operating cash ﬂow excluding
certain items of $7.4 billion a 20% increase over prior year. And we returned $6.5
billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Over the past ﬁve years our management operating cash ﬂow per share, excluding
certain items, has grown at a compound rate of 11% and we have returned $30 billion
to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.
So how does this all translate to future results? It begins with the balance of our
portfolio across both categories and geographies. We spoke earlier about the
attractive growth proﬁle for snacks and beverages globally for companies that are
well positioned. From a geographic perspective each market type plays an important
role in our portfolio.
The emerging markets are primarily top-line growth drivers with some potential for
margin improvement in the short-term. Developing markets drive balanced top-line
growth and margin and ROIC improvement. And developed markets contribute
relatively less to top-line growth but also have very attractive absolute margins and
returns.
Taken together the market portfolio provides for balanced growth, margin and
return improvement, attractive current returns and sustainable future growth
opportunities.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-21
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 7 of 18Our ﬁnancial model is driven by mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth
and from a category perspective we expect our global beverage business to grow in
the low; to mid-single-digits. From a market perspective we expect developed
markets to grow in a low; to mid-single-digits and our developing and emerging
markets to grow in the high-single; to low-double-digits.
With this growth proﬁle we expect about two-thirds of our growth to come from
snacks and from a geographic perspective about two-thirds of our growth to come
from developing and emerging markets. As a result our business mix will gradually
shift to be more heavily weighted towards snacks and more heavily weighted toward
developing and emerging markets than we are today. This revenue growth proﬁle
supports our long-term growth model.
We expect mid-single-digit revenue growth, mostly organic, balanced between
good for you, better for you and fun for you with emerging and developing markets
contributing disproportionately to the growth. We also expect that margins in ROIC
will continue to improve reﬂecting scale and productivity and EPS will grow high-
single-digits.
And management operating cash ﬂow driven by earnings growth and CapEx and
working capital eﬃciency is expected to grow in line with net income, generating
attractive cash ﬂow available for shareholders.
For 2013 we expect core constant currency EPS growth of 7% oﬀ a core 2012 base of
$4.10. We expect organic revenue growth of mid-single-digits, core constant
currency operating proﬁt growth of approximately 6% and approximately 1 point of
leverage below the line driven by share repurchases oﬀset somewhat by higher net
interest expense of approximately $90 million from higher debt balances. We expect
our core eﬀective tax rate to be approximately 27% for the full year.
Within these expectations we assume positive price mix, low-single-digit commodity
inﬂation, productivity of $900 million and A&M growing at least in line with our net
revenue growth.
We continue to manage our commodities using a systematic hedging program and
at this point we have more than half of our commodities' exposures covered for the
year with more coverage in the close in quarters and the level of coverage will ramp
up as we move further into the year.
We expect the rate of inﬂation to be fairly consistent across the quarters in total and
that rate of inﬂation will be a bit more pronounced in foods than in beverages.
Our productivity assumption is completely in line with the three-year $3 billion
program that we launched last year and the savings will be used to help oﬀset
inﬂation as well as to provide funding for investment back into the business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-21
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 8 of 18One of our key investment areas is supporting our brands with advertising and
marketing where we will grow our A&M investment at least in line with net sales,
meaning you should expect A&M spending of a least 5.7% of sales which was our
2012 baseline investment.
In addition, we're also accelerating our investments in research and development
and in innovation. We do anticipate foreign exchange translation to have up to 1
point of negative impact on our net revenue, operating proﬁt and EPS for the year.
And this includes the impact of last week's Venezuelan devaluation.
We also expect an approximate $100 million non-core charge related to the
devaluation of our monetary assets in Venezuela in Q1. We anticipate structural
changes, primarily bottle refranchisings, will have a negative impact on our full-year
net revenue growth of approximately 1 point. And as you model out the First Quarter
we expect foreign exchange translation to have a negative 2 point impact on EPS.
Revenue in the First Quarter will have an estimated 3 point negative impact from
structural changes and a negative 1 point impact from foreign exchange translation.
From a cash ﬂow perspective we expect management operating cash ﬂow excluding
certain items of more than $7 billion. We continue to drive cash ﬂow through even
more eﬃcient working capital management and continued tight controls over capital
spending.
For 2013 we expect to see continued improvement in our key working capital metrics
and to manage net capital spending to $3 billion which is well within our long-term
target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue.
From an M&A perspective, consistent with our past comments, we believe the
portfolio is largely where it needs to be and consequently we do not -- do not see
the need for any large-scale M&A. As a result we will plan to continue to return the
strong cash ﬂow to our shareholders. We just approved a new three-year $10 billion
share repurchase program to succeed the current program that expires in June of
this year.
And our Board has approved a 5.6% quarterly dividend increase beginning with our
June payment. In total, we expect to return approximately $6.4 billion to
shareholders in 2013, $3.4 billion in dividends and $3 billion in share repurchases.
Net our outlook for 2013 is consistent with our long-term targets for net revenue,
operating proﬁt and EPS. We expect to drive improved margins and improved net
ROIC. And we expect to generate and return cash ﬂow to shareholders and that
remains a top priority for PepsiCo.
To wrap up, we feel good about where the business is, we have sizable structural
advantages and took actions to strengthen our business in 2012. As a result we
believe we are back in a virtuous circle.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-21

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Hugh JohnstonWe have a business capable of generating healthy, mid-single-digit organic revenue
growth, enabling us to capture and leverage productivity savings that can be
reinvested in brand building, innovation and extending our go-to-market
advantages which, as a consequence, reinforce and fuel our top-line growth for the
future. With that I would be happy to take any of your questions from the audience.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Yes, Brian.
Thanks, Hugh. I guess I wanted to get back to just talk a little bit about international
scale and the importance of the specialty developing markets as part of the
algorithm going forward and appreciate the comments about the contribution to
revenue.
But if you could talk a little bit more about the path to how specially developing
markets will contribute to proﬁt growth going forward. And what is required -- do
you have enough scale today or will you need to build more scale, tuck-in
acquisitions -- just kind of what that pathway would be? And also if you could also
comment just on the importance of having both a food and beverage business in
those markets and how that plays into it.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Sure, happy to. A couple of questions there so let me parse it a bit. In terms of
whether we need to do M&A and those types of things, we may occasionally choose
to do a tuck-in acquisition. And we have talked about those in the past. They are
typically a few hundred million dollar size, they are accounted for in our cash ﬂow
expectations. And the decision we'll make on whether we choose to do a small
acquisition or whether we will build purely organically will really be driven by what is
the right value creation move.
So in some markets we may say, you know what, we believe we can do this entirely
on our own as we have done in India. In some markets we may choose to do some
tuck-ins as we have done in Brazil. So I think it is going to be a balancing act. But I
think we have got that all captured in the ﬁnancial guidance that we've shared.
Regarding the pathway to improve margins, really many of the things that we do in
emerging and developing markets, it's a matter of choice as to how quickly we want
to move the margins up. Because our market positions are as strong as they are we
could choose to move margins up more quickly by taking more pricing. But that will
slow the rate of category development and it will slow the rate of competitive
advantage that we can build particularly in the snack food businesses.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-21
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 10 of 18Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Hugh JohnstonTypically when we put ourselves in a position where we build a relatively high market
share position and we develop the margin improvement more slowly we build a
stronger, sturdier business for the long haul.
Probably the best example I can point to on that is our Mexico business where we
slowly but surely over the course of really a decade or two built a tremendous
franchise there and a franchise that has quite high market share. And while we don't
disclose and margins explicitly, if you look at developed markets snacks businesses
they would be right in that similar type of range.
We think that is the right pathway to growth. The choice that management has. And
frankly as we communicated our guidance to all of you, is we need to make choices
around how quickly we want to develop the margins versus how quickly we want to
develop the category. And as portfolio managers that is very much our job.
I would expect though to see continued margin improvement across all the sectors.
It doesn't have to be rapid margin improvement to make all of these numbers work.
But I would expect to see across all of our sectors continued margin improvement.
(Inaudible; microphone inaccessible)?
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
So yes, food and beverage together, the last piece of that. We do think that actually,
particularly in developing and emerging markets, food and beverage together is an
important characteristic of the portfolio. If you think about the way these markets
tend to develop, beverages just develop ﬁrst partly because they are relatively
inexpensive, partly because of the terriﬁc marketing.
And by virtue of doing that they actually provide scale beneﬁt that the snack
beverage -- the snack business can leverage oﬀ of. So it enables -- it is an enabler to
competing in beverages and then it's also an enabler to getting snacks businesses
developed earlier which allows for us, again, to build those share advantages which
allow for us to build the competitive barriers to build stronger businesses over time.
We have said in the past that we think the beneﬁt of having the global snack and
beverage business together is north of $800 million. So $800 million to $1 billion of
synergies created by virtue of having those two together and that is purely based on
the cost side of it, it doesn't account for any -- the revenue in the longer-term,
strategic beneﬁts as well.
So as we think about these things, same consumer, same customer, shared R&D,
oftentimes shared elements of the supply chain. We think there is real tangible
advantage in the short term and we think there is signiﬁcant strategic advantage to
the complementarity of the portfolio over the longer-term.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-21

A - Hugh JohnstonHugh, just over a year ago you held a meeting and embarked basically on a
beverage business review. You said you would get back to us in 12 to 18 months and
obviously you have pushed that out to early 2014. Could you maybe take us through
in more depth what kind of fundamental or strategic thinking has changed that you
have decided to push that out?
And Brian, also a year ago at CAGNY you talked a lot about Frito-Lay North America
increasing its penetration on the more premium end of the business. Could you
maybe bring us up to date on how you would scorecard yourself so far and what you
expect to see this year?
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
So why don't I handle the beverage piece ﬁrst, Brian and --
{BIO 1841158 <GO>}
Sure.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
--kick the snacks piece over to do? Yes. So, Mike, we talked about 12 to 18 months last
year. We indicated on the call last week that we felt like it was more likely to be a
year from now. So that would be about 24 months out. A couple of things have
evolved.
Number one. And we referenced this on our earnings call last week. Sweetener
development that we think can fundamentally change some of the elements of the
core product oﬀering in carbonated soft drinks. Some things are happening that are
a bit closer in.
And you will understand if I don't go any further in terms of answering speciﬁc
questions on what is happening speciﬁcally with sweeteners because we do view
that as competitively -- competitive information that sharing with all of you probably
wouldn't be good for the shareholders right now.
But we do think the sweetener piece is developing more rapidly and we need to see
that play out before we make a decision on exactly what the optimal structure would
be for the beverage business going forward. So that is number one.
Number two. And we want to see how the beverage business plays out this year. We
think we have got the business on the right track. We did see it sequentially improve
over the course of the year and we want to give it a bit more time with some of the
strategies that we implemented around brand building, some of the strategies that
we implemented around revenue management, price pack architecture, some of the
things we have done on productivity. And we want give the operational side of the
business a bit more time to play its way out.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-21
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 12 of 18A - Brian Cornell
A - Hugh Johnston
Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantSo the combination of there could be signiﬁcant value creation as the sweetener
situation continues to evolve and having a better sense of exactly how quickly that is
going to evolve and how evolutionary versus revolutionary it is going to be. And by
the way, we do see it as more evolutionary than revolutionary. We think giving that a
bit more time is probably the right answer for shareholders in terms of realizing the
maximum value creation out of that business.
{BIO 1841158 <GO>}
Mike, if I turn to Frito-Lay, let me start with a look at the broader scorecard. And I
think across the year you saw solid progress in Frito-Lay leading up to a very solid
Fourth Quarter. So sequential improvement in our performance throughout the year
and I really think it demonstrates that the strategy and the playbook that Tom Greco
and the Frito-Lay team have in place right now is gaining traction with both our
customers and with consumers.
The investments we are making in our brands clearly are improving brand equity.
You talked about the tremendous response we had to the Lay's Do Us a Flavor
contest. 3.8 million consumers providing us with recipes; very strong engagement.
We have had a very solid pipeline of innovation that is consumer led in place for
Frito-Lay and you are starting to see some of that unfold as we move into the ﬁrst
half of the year.
Solid progress from a productivity standpoint as we look at ways to drive greater
eﬃciencies in our supply chain and go-to-market system. Then from an execution
standpoint a real focus on making sure we've got the right products, packs and price
in place channel by channel, customer by customer, including as it pertains to that
important premium segment where we have demonstrated solid mid-teen growth in
line with the category.
We feel very good about the progress we are making with the big brands like
Stacy's, the progress we have demonstrated in the new Sabra categories with our
hummus products. And we still see that as a very important part of our future at Frito-
Lay. But within that we don't want to lose focus on that important mainstream
portfolio which is the heart and soul of our Company.
We want to continue to accelerate our entry into the premium space and then
continue to look at selective ways to compete in value. But overall good progress
against the scorecard, sequential improvement throughout the year and I think it sets
us up for continued solid progress as we move into 2013.

out there from consumers?
Then I wanted to follow up on GES which is something that came out with a little bit
of fanfare a couple years ago and since has -- sort of we haven't heard as much
about it. So can you tell us where you stand on that? Is that still something that can
be a big breakthrough? And as you look at that how much of that is the bottom-line
savings versus potentially greater top-line from SKU availability?
{BIO 1841158 <GO>}
John, let me start with the start of the start of the year. And as you have heard us say
before during our earnings call, January is a very diﬃcult month to read. The weather
overlaps year on year. This year we had the additional challenge of changes in tax,
the refund changes that took place. So it's a diﬃcult month to read.
But as you look at a measured channel performance, the month of January started
out very much like the Fourth Quarter ﬁnished. So pretty stable food and beverage
trends and we would expect that to continue throughout the year. So as we look at it,
January is a tough month to read.
But I think we see generally consumer stability right now, the trends in food and
beverage being very consistent in measured channels from what we saw in the back
half of last year as we started this year and that is the environment that we are
planning for in 2013.
From a GES standpoint we remain very committed to that initiative. We have
continued to roll that out throughout 2012, we have got plans for expansion in 2013.
But it is going to be a long runway as we balance both the need for capital and the
human capital investment to do that right.
So we are still very committed to the initiative, we are very pleased with the returns it
is generating, it provides us much greater ﬂexibility in our go-to-market system,
ability to tailor our oﬀering customer by customer. But it is going to be a four or ﬁve
year runway until we (hit the brakes).
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Then from a ﬁnancial perspective, John, just let me add on on the GES initiative. You
will recall we talked about the fact that early implementations would in eﬀect fund
the next one, right. So we get the productivity in the P&L but there is an investment
on these markets.
So somewhere around the 2014-2015 time frame is when we start to tip over where
we have got more markets in than we have left to go so you have enough critical
mass so that it starts to show through in margin accretion within Frito-Lay. So that is
still the time frame we are working against.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-21

A - Hugh JohnstonIf anything the returns are at or equal -- are equal to or better than what we have
talked about in the past and what we had originally scoped out for the project. So
GES still very much on track and, again, the capital for GES very much captured
within all of our guidance as well. So there won't be anything disruptive from that
perspective. So Ollie?
Thanks. So I want to push a little bit on this margin discussion that you started a little
bit earlier because your long-term targets have to have margin expansion in them.
But if you look at your track record 2002 to 2009 your margins were essentially ﬂat,
18% operating margins (ish). And all of your EPS growth was FX and M&A and a
better marketplace than you certainly have today.
And right now you are starting from a lower margin base, right, because a
reinvestment year and because of the M&A on the bottlers. So what can you tell us
that gives us conﬁdence that you will actually start to see margins go up in a tougher
environment, right?
And you said, look, we expect all of our business segments, to an earlier question, to
go up. But we know there are diﬃculties in PAB. We know that Frito is maxed out at
least in North America in terms of margins in some sense. And there is an inherent
margin -- negative margin mix for the time being in the emerging markets and
you're going to have to investment. So what can you point to that gives us a little bit
more conﬁdence in that trajectory?
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Sure, happy to. Really a couple of pieces to it. Number one is the global operations
organization that we have set up. The reality of it is we do fairly similar things in
markets around the world. How you run a pay the chip 50 line in the US probably
shouldn't be that diﬀerent than the way you run it in India, the way you run it in Brazil,
the way you run it in Mexico.
The reality is because we have been operating in the past as such a decentralized
company with such limited coordination that they do run diﬀerently. And part of the
reason we brought in the head of Frito-Lay operations from the past to run global
operations for us was to essentially established basically the data, the benchmarks
and then to work across the organizations to say, look, there is one way to run these
lines and you will have X many people running these lines and that is the way we do
it.
Now, we are not insensitive to the diﬀerent labor capital trade-oﬀs that occur in
diﬀerent markets, obviously, we have lower cost labor you may make diﬀerent
choices. But there is a best practice element to this that we see as very near in, very
straightforward productivity opportunities that are highly reliable in terms of their
realization. And that is diﬀerent. We just -- should we have had it? You could make
the case for that. But we didn't have it in the 2002 to 2010, 2011 timeframe. We do
have that now.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-21

A - Brian CornellThe second piece of it is as we have built the R&D function we actually are applying
new processing technologies that we haven't applied in the past, again, particularly
in the snack food business in terms of the types of things that we can do on the line
to make the lines more eﬃcient using less commodities. Using acceleration line
speeds to again provide essentially a lower cost structure or even a change to a
process that is just a lower cost process than the one that we have been working
through right now.
And that takes a bit longer time and as the best practice types of opportunity start to
tail oﬀ over the couple of years those types of technology improvements that these
are things that -- we know how to do them right now, it will take a while to basically
prove them out completely, roll them across the globe in diﬀerent markets. But those
opportunities are well understood and within our grasp.
Then the third piece of it is, there are two elements to the developing and emerging
market piece. There is the piece that says those are lower margins. So as they grow
faster it is a drag and we know that. But at the same time those are businesses and
there are big scalable elements across those businesses that as they grow their
margins individually will improve.
And when I referenced in terms of Brian's question the choices that we make, the
choices that we are oftentimes making are how quickly do we want to acceleration
margins? Because you are making a choice to some degree between developing the
category more quickly or taking your margins up more quickly. And that is the
portfolio role, frankly, that management plays in all of this.
I think the sum total of all those three should give you a level of conﬁdence that we
in fact do have the capability, we do have the ideas sitting there to go and realize the
types of productivity that we haven't in the past. Step one of that was 2012. So we
literally doubled our annual rate of productivity in 2012 and that was masked
because we had a lot of commodity inﬂation and pension cost issues.
We made an A&M investment. But there was a legitimate doubling of the rate of
productivity in 2012. And that is the data point I would point to to say it is not as if I
am saying we are going to do it, we have already embarked on that journey with a
great sense of urgency and we did it in 2012.
To follow up on that, Brian, can you talk about the expansion opportunity from a
margin perspective in the Frito-Lay North America business over time? And given
you had such a high level versus the peer set is there room to continue to expand
margins and what would be the key drivers behind it?
{BIO 1841158 <GO>}
I will build oﬀ of Hugh's comments, I think as I look at the Frito-Lay business. But
really I look across our whole portfolio. I think there are two important areas thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-21

Page 16 of 18A - Hugh Johnston
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Hugh Johnstonallow us to continue to increase margins. One is just enhancing the value of our
brands.
And that starts with enhancing brand equity, making sure we have got great
diﬀerentiation in our innovation pipeline, continue to improve the quality of the
products we oﬀer, enhancing and tailoring our go-to-market oﬀering channel by
channel so that we really match that up with the shopper needs.
So on one hand we have got to continue to make sure we improve and enhance the
value of our brands. The second part is really leveraging those global best practices.
How do we make sure that we are leveraging in Mexico and Brazil and Canada some
of the same best practices that we have in the US and really taking up those
standards.
The other lever is the use of technology. And there are technology solutions in front
of us that I think are going to allow us to run our business more eﬃciently, run our
go-to-market systems more eﬃciently and service our customers more eﬃciently.
So between improving the value that consumers place behind our brands,
leveraging best practices around the world and leveraging new technology
breakthroughs both from a productivity and R&D standpoint, I think that is where we
will ﬁnd the opportunities for margin enhancement.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Yes.
I had a question about -- for North American CSD's, the promotional environment. To
me it really doesn't seem like the depth or the frequencies of promotions have really
moderated a whole lot. And running three for $10 doesn't seem to really do much for
building brand equity, for building the category growth, for improving your channel
mix.
And for the retailers I don't think there is really evidence that it really builds long-
term consumer share wins. So it is kind of a net loss for everybody. So just how do
we get to a lower level of frequency? Or have you considered doing something
radical and going to say a small market like Hawaii or Alaska and just materially
cutting out the amount of promotion? Thanks.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Yes. It's a good question and high/low pricing in CSDs has been a challenge for a
long time. You almost have to step back and look a little bit at some of the historical
drivers on it. When you had a separate concentrate and bottling company that
tended to create more of that behavior because concentrate companies are oriented
towards volume and bottling companies are oriented towards price. And that was a
US phenomenon. There is better alignment internationally in all of that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-21

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantThe second piece is retailers tended to use it as a traﬃc driver and they are doing
less of that now. And have been gradually doing less of that over the course of the
last decade.
A couple of the things that we have done and in particular Al Carey talked about it
about six months ago I think at the Deutsche conference. Implementing what we call
a hybrid everyday value program. We don't think an everyday low price strategy is
the right strategy for the category. We do think that when -- it is still an impulse buy,
when it gets on the ﬂoor it tends to get more consumer traction.
That said, your point that the pricing environment just got way too high/low over the
course of maybe ﬁve or six years. And what we started to do last year and we are
doing with a couple of very signiﬁcant customers this year is to essentially have
higher pricing on the holidays and lower pricing every day to start to level out some
of those kind of steep peaks and valleys.
We did it last year with one customer, it was very successful. As I mentioned, we are
doing it with more customers. We do think it sends the right message from a brand
building perspective, to your point. We actually think it cuts a lot of cost out because
when you're basically selling 50% of your business in nine weeks of the year you
wind up renting extra warehouse space, you wind up incurring extra labor charges
and that -- we started to diminish that last year; we think we will diminish it a whole
lot more this year.
So you lower your supply-chain costs as well. And frankly you also get the consumer
not expecting the deep, deep price cuts around the holiday time frame. So again,
put it in place last year with the one customer, went well, got it in place with some
big customers this year. We think it is going to be successful this year.
The industry structure now doesn't suﬀer from all of this noise around pricing that I
think tended to lead to some behavior in the past that wasn't good for the category.
So I think we are structured well and I think we have got the right initiatives to
basically see a -- CSD pricing environment that I would characterize as rational.
Hugh, you have got time for one more.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Okay, Mark?
Hugh, a question on the balance sheet. How open are you to increasing leverage?
You've got a number of peers in the two, two and a half times EBITDA level range. It
doesn't hurt their investment grade credit rating. You have re-based earnings, you
have reiterated that you are not focused on big M&A. So obviously you're not goingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-21

Page 18 of 18A - Hugh Johnston
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantto say you are going to do it today. But how open are you to that kind of approach in
order to increase the return to shareholders in terms of cash going back to them?
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Yes. In terms of analyzing it, I analyze it every year. And at least for the last several
years the answer that we got to was we think we are at the right spot in terms of
leverage and the rating that falls out of the leverage that we have.
So I don't think that it would be a value creating move to take as any further on the
leverage scale. If you look at where our leverage is relative to our rating, we are in I
think a highly productive spot, a pretty fair sweet spot in terms of cost of ﬁnancing.
But it is not something that we continue with as an ongoing assumption. We look at
it every single year and the conclusion we came to as recently as just in the last
couple of months this year was we think we are in the right spot from a leverage
perspective.
Okay. With that PepsiCo. First want to thank you, Brian, Jamie, for spending time with
us today. Thanks again for sponsoring lunch. And remember, management will be
available at lunch so there is no breakout session, we'll be available for lunch.
