{BIO 15004624 <GO>}
Hi, everyone. Welcome to Google Cloud Next 2021. We are happy you're here. Of
course, I'd be happier if you could actually be here, in person. Don't get me wrong,
Thomas is Great company, but he still doesn't laugh at my container jokes.
So while many of us are still waiting for a return to normal, it does feel like we are on
our way. The question is, will we recognize normal when we get there? The
pandemic has sped up digitization in all aspects of our lives. It's changed how we
visit the doctor, how our kids learn in school, and how we connect with one another.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 64And it's made the future of work our present, giving us renewed opportunity to
transform our organizations. From our work with customers, Thomas and I have
learned there are three things that position us to be most helpful to businesses. First,
our Cloud platform. It's designed to help enterprises transform through digitization,
built on the deep investments we've made in technical infrastructure over the past
23 years.
Looking at our networking and data center investments alone, we have the largest
network with the lowest-latency of any Cloud provider. With our expansions into
Warsaw, Delhi, Melbourne and Toronto this year, we now have 28 regions, with plans
for ten more. And it's all connected by 19 subsea cables.
Our Grace Hopper transatlantic cable will be the ﬁrst to incorporate novel optical
ﬁber switching. Second, our enterprise customers beneﬁt from our consumer scale
and innovation. We have a deep and broad consumer ecosystem of devices and
services. YouTube connects a global community of viewers and creators. Android,
Nest, Assistant, and Maps are loved by people around the world.
We have the unique ability to connect consumer ecosystems with enterprise
ecosystems. For example, the realistic voices and language understanding that
powers Google Assistant can improve enterprise customer experiences and increase
satisfaction. And the underlying visual technology that enables Google Lens to help
people shop or learn about a new ﬂower in their garden can help manufacturers
identify defects.
Third, we oﬀer comprehensive security that helps organizations, including ours,
protect what matters. Security is foundational to everything we do. We have a long
history of building it into every layer of the computing environment. We're a pioneer
of zero-trust computing, and have deep experience running this model at scale.
On its own, any one of these pillars would be helpful to customers. Put together, they
can be transformative which is the mission of Google Cloud. We continue to drive
innovation through our products. Over the past year, we've had more than 1,500
product and feature releases. That's about four a day.
They're all designed to be helpful, from Smart Canvas in Google Workspace that
makes collaboration richer, to new AI-powered industry solutions, and Big Query
Omni for data analytics across any Cloud. We've also made signiﬁcant partnership
announcements. For example, we teamed up with global telecom leaders such as
Ericsson, Nokia and T-Systems to deliver 5G edge and hosted computing solutions.
What I'm most excited about is how our strengths in Cloud, Consumer and Security
are helping top enterprises accelerate their transformation.
Ford chose Google as their transformation partner because of our strength in
consumer and cloud. Together, we are innovating in electriﬁcation, connectivity, and
self-driving technologies. Ford is harnessing Google Maps to help drivers navigate,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 64Thomas KurianGoogle Assistant to help drivers concentrate, and Google Play to keep passengers
learning and entertained.
L'Oreal partnered across Google to build a virtual try-on experience. They are
harnessing the best AI models as well as using YouTube to build a community of
fans, and Google Shopping to make it easy to discover and buy their products.
We are humbled that so many organizations continue to put their trust in Google
Cloud. And we are committed to helping you solve the biggest challenges you face.
I'll be back a little later to talk more about how we do that.
But ﬁrst, I'll turn the stage over to Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, to talk more
about our mission.
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
Thank you, Sundar. Hello, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here on Google's Silicon
Valley campus today for the moment we all look forward to all year long, the
opportunity to connect with you, our customers, partners and developers, and to
share all the amazing, exciting stuﬀ we've been working on.
A special thank you to all our sponsors, especially our Luminary Sponsors, Accenture,
Atos/Maven Wave, and Deloitte. Let's ﬁrst hear from some of our customers about
the amazing ways in which they have accelerated transformation with Google Cloud.
(Presentation)
Now, it's not a secret that many of the biggest and most innovative tech companies,
leaders such as Spotify, Twitter, Shopify, Mercado Libre, ShareChat, Dapper Labs, and
so many other exciting startups and tech leaders choose Google Cloud to help them
build, scale, and innovate. Still, other customers are transforming using our purpose-
built industry solutions.
The Home Depot, for instance, used contact center AI to reduce customer resolution
time by 91 million minutes. Procter & Gamble creates personalized omnichannel
journeys from over 275 million consumer records. IKEA Retail use Recommendations
AI to increase eCommerce click-thru rates by 30% and increase order value by 2%.
FIH, a Foxconn company, used Visual Inspection to identify defects 10 times more
accurately. Mr. Cooper, a leading mortgage services provider, used Document AI to
process mortgage documents 400% more eﬃciently. And Bank of New York Mellon
developed a liquidity solution that predicts nearly 40% of securities settlement
failures with 90% accuracy.
We are helping many businesses drive durable innovation through long-term
partnerships with Google's Transformation Cloud. To help them transform, we focus
on ﬁve key themes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

have the Industry's leading technology infrastructure? Three, are we creating the
best hybrid workplace for our passionate and talented employees? Four, do we
know that our data, systems and users are secure now, and that they will be secure in
the future? And ﬁve, are we working together to address the most important
challenges facing our world today?
We help organizations address these important questions. Let's start with the ﬁrst
question. Are we the best at understanding and using data in our industry? We help
organizations unify their data across multiple clouds and silos, combining
unstructured and structured data and making data every employee's super power.
Using Data Analytics and AI together, Schrodinger accelerated clinical drug
discovery by 60%, ﬁnding new breakthroughs faster. Like many states around the
United States, the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development confronted a
wave of new unemployment claims. Using Google's data cloud, they clear over
750,000 unemployment claims, reducing claim time from weeks to just days, and
disbursing over $2 billion in unemployment beneﬁts.
Walmart is transforming the experience for the approximately 220 million shoppers
around the globe who visit a Walmart store, club, or eCommerce Web site each
week.
I'm honored today to welcome Suresh Kumar, Executive Vice President, Walmart's
Global Chief Technology Oﬃcer, and Chief Development Oﬃcer.
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
Hi, Thomas, and hello, everyone! I'm excited to be here today to share about how we
at Walmart are innovating on behalf of our customers, our associates, and the role
that our partners like you, Google, have played in our innovation journey.
Now, I came to Walmart at a time of incredible digital transformation, and jointly with
my team, created a robust execution plan to accelerate the transformation across
three areas, building great customer experiences, optimizing our business, and
modernizing our platform and our infrastructure.
Each of these three priorities are individually important, but when you bring them
together, in the scale of a business like Walmart, it has a massive impact. If you move
at speed, you can completely transform global operations and disrupt entire
industries. Some of our most data intensive are critical decisioning process are
getting the BigQuery treatment.
Through this, not only are we seeing signiﬁcant savings that will continue as we
migrate more and more data over, we are also seeing the ability to use the data in
interesting ways, including enabling analytics at scale, and turning data into
actionable insights. From a data migration to BigQuery standpoint, 97% of the tablesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 64Thomas Kurianused for data warehouse have already migrated to the cloud, and 30% of a big data
have been migrated with plans to almost double that by the end of this ﬁscal year.
And the cherry on the top is that BigQuery has allowed us to integrate with pretty
much any data visualization tool and analytics tool that's out there. Thereby,
improving our processing time by 23%, and, of course, needless to say, a much
better user experience.
Using BigQuery has had a direct impact on our business. And a current example is
our ability to close our ﬁnancial books in three days instead of ﬁve days, and that's a
pretty big deal. Leveraging our Cloud has enabled us to unleash the potential of AI
across our entire business. This goes from predicting demand to managing in-stock
levels to optimizing supply chain, to freeing up time for our associates to serve our
customers.
As one example, Express Delivery which is our two-hour [ph] delivery service, which
we launched last year, actively uses AI behind the scenes as the customer is creating
their order. Multiple (inaudible) work in unison to optimize the delivery route and
determine if the customer is eligible for express delivery.
We are building our own AI and ML capabilities to power multiple areas of our
business including classiﬁcations, natural language processing, forecasting,
regression, computer vision, predictions, process automations and a whole lot more.
So, to wrap up, I'm really excited about the opportunity Walmart has to drive
innovation and to further disrupt the retail industry. I hope you will agree that our
work together is making a huge diﬀerence for our customers and our associates.
Thank you for having me.
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
Thank you, Suresh. Tens of thousands of incredible organizations, like Walmart,
choose Google's Data Cloud for four reasons. First, Google's Data Cloud is the most
complete and uniﬁed data and AI platform to help you manage every stage of the
data life cycle, from running operational transactions to developing analytical
applications. We help customers unify data lakes and warehouses as data lake
houses to reduce complexity and to combine structured and unstructured data.
Built-in Data Science and AI with support for MapReduce, Spark, and Presto enable
continuous learning and experimentation. And, we support real-time streaming that
natively uses open source standards like Beam and Flink. Google's Data Cloud is
unmatched for speed, scale, security and reliability.
BigQuery, one of the most successful and beloved data warehouse solutions, with its
unique serverless approach, during a typical week, helps more than 3,000 diﬀerent
organizations analyze more than 200 petabytes of data. And thousands of customers
use Dataproc to run Spark and Hadoop clusters easily.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

Page 8 of 64Aleksandra AleksicSpanner, a fully managed relational database with unlimited scale and multi-zone
and multi-region consistency serves more than one billion requests per second and
provides a ﬁve nine SLA. Google Data Cloud's Vertex AI oﬀers the AI pioneered at
Google Research and DeepMind, so that every data scientist and ML engineer can
now build, deploy and scale AI Models faster and with 80% less code, using AI the
same way Google does.
For instance, GE Appliances, an appliance manufacturing leader for more than a
century, is using Google Cloud, including AI at the edge, to build innovative digital
products with over-the-air updates. Finally, Google's Data Cloud is more open
standards-based. You can choose from Postgres, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, or
migrate from Oracle or SQL Server. And we have strategic Partners with leading
data-driven applications.
For instance, C3 AI has made its entire lineup of AI software Based applications
available on Google Cloud. Our customers can analyze, govern, and visualize data
from many databases and storage systems on Google or other Clouds, including all
of Google's databases, Google Sheets, BigQuery, using LOOKER, our premier BI and
embedded analytics solution.
Today, we are thrilled and excited to announce that we will be integrating Tableau, a
leader in data visualization, with Looker, Google Sheets, and BigQuery. Tableau
customers will soon be able to use Looker's semantic model, enabling new levels of
data governance and access to data.
Let's take a look. Aleks, over to you.
Thank you, Thomas. In this demo, we're going to show you how you can seamlessly
use Looker and Tableau together to answer your critical business questions.
Let's say, I work at an eCommerce company and our Looker model provides a
consistent view across the organization for our most important business metrics.
Here, for example, you can see the deﬁnition for gross margin. Our Looker
dashboard is based on that same semantic model. Since it provides trusted insights
at a glance, I can immediately see that sales are up. However, did I miss anything?
Let's ﬁnd out.
Say I'm more comfortable working in spreadsheets. I can now take advantage of the
new integration between Looker and Google Sheets. With a couple of clicks, I have
access to my governed and trusted Looker data in Sheets, and I can easily connect to
my data models.
To understand which factors are impacting sales, I'll drag and drop ﬁelds from my
model into a pivot table to break out sales by category over time. Since it's pulling
from Looker, I can trust that all the data deﬁnitions are consistent. I can use familiarFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

Page 9 of 64Thomas KurianSheets formulas and formatting to get insights faster and understand how speciﬁc
products are selling.
We see a notable downward trend month over month for activewear. I want to share
these ﬁndings with my marketing team, who's using Tableau. Now I can use the new
Tableau and Looker integration to combine data from my Looker data model with
marketing data to build a more comprehensive view of my business.
Next, I'm going to plot sales by category, and then add marketing spend to the view.
Tableau makes it easy for me to drill down on relevant data. Now I can see that social
marketing spend was signiﬁcantly lower for activewear, and this is why there's a
downward trend in activewear sales.
I'm going to publish this result on Tableau online and tag my marketing team so they
can take action. Leveraging integrations between Tableau, Sheets, and Looker, allows
our teams to build powerful visualizations using trusted data. We can then share
these visualizations throughout our organization to drive informed decisions, action,
and impact.
Back over to you, Thomas.
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
Thank you, Aleks. The second question customers ask is, do we have industry-
leading technology infrastructure? We're experiencing great momentum with our
Open Infrastructure Cloud. Many of the most demanding and technically advanced
customers in the world disproportionately choose us.
Take, for example, leading media companies and streaming services, such as
Univision and Globo, the largest media group in Latin America, they use our very
high-performance networking, computing and storage to broadcast media,
including live events such as the recent Tokyo Olympics.
Leading telecommunications companies are also choosing Google Cloud. Reliance
Jio, the world's second largest mobile carrier, is automating its 5G network.
Vodafone is processing over a billion network events each day. AT&T is delivering
new multi-access edge computing solutions, and Telus is migrating critical IT and
network workloads, all to Google Cloud.
Leading data management companies, including Databricks, Redis, Cockroach Labs,
Couchbase, Elastic, Inﬂux Data, MariaDB, MongoDB, Neo4j, and Singlestore are all
growing faster on Google Cloud than on any other Cloud and they love our storage
scalability and advanced infrastructure.
MongoDB, for instance, has more net new customers via Google Cloud Marketplace
than any other Cloud. Leading cybersecurity companies, such as Palo Alto Networks,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 64Exabeam, F5 Shape, Splunk, Broadcom, and ForgeRock are also choosing Google
Cloud for its performance, global scale, and underlying security.
Customers are migrating and transforming SAP and VMware workloads to Google
Cloud. In the last year, we've added three times the number of SAP customers as the
prior year, and we're accelerating. PayPal, for instance, has an SAP/HANA scale out
supporting 40 million business transactions daily and 200 billion records touched in
just 30 seconds. Mitel, in Canada, migrated over 1,000 VM wear virtual machines in
less than 90 days to Google Cloud VMware Engine.
Nylas, an API platform company, chose our Tau virtual machines along with Google
Kubernetes Engine, as they saw over 40% better price performance than on a
competitor. Customers choose our open cloud infrastructure for three main reasons.
First, we make your path to migrate and modernize using the Cloud easy with
migration tools, new serverless and container capabilities, and Managed services as
your developers spend more time building experiences that your customers love.
Second, we oﬀer transformative capabilities with cutting edge performance and
security. And our network oﬀers three times the throughput of other Cloud
providers. Third, we remain, and were, the very ﬁrst and only Cloud provider with a
clear, multi-cloud strategy.
We provide you with a consistent developer experience built on open source to
write once and deploy anywhere. Many customers like Plaid, a ﬁnancial services
leader, use Anthos to deploy, operate and manage applications across multiple
clouds.
Recently, we introduced Anthos for virtual machines, standardizing the way that you
manage applications across both virtual machines and containers. For multi-cloud
data, BigQuery Omni lets customers analyze data across Google Cloud, AWS, and
Azure.
With it, Johnson & Johnson, was able to combine data in Google Cloud and AWS S3
using BigQuery Omni without needing to migrate data. Customers also want to
expand where they use Google Cloud, whether in their private data Centers or out
on the edge.
For instance, some workloads cannot move to the public cloud entirely due to the
need for large amounts of local data Processing, extremely low latency, or strict
regulations. To solve these challenges, we're announcing today, Google Distributed
Cloud, a portfolio of hardware and software solutions that extend our infrastructure
to the edge and even into your own data center.
To tell you more about it, please welcome Ines from our Google Cloud Distributed
Cloud Team.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

Thomas KurianThank you, Thomas. Google Distributed Cloud is a set of fully managed services
running on Google managed hardware. Based on open APIs and built on Anthos, it
gives customers greater deployment ﬂexibility and ensures more consistent
operations across hybrid and multi-cloud environments more than any other cloud
provider.
There are four deployment scenarios depending on your speciﬁc needs. Google's
network edge. This allows customers to leverage over 140 network edge locations
around the world. Operator edge. This scenario is designed to accommodate
emergency services and applications with a stringent latency and reliability
requirements for a speciﬁc operator. Customer edge, this scenario supports
customer's own edge locations such as retail stores, factory ﬂoors, or branch oﬃces,
which require localized compute and processes. And ﬁnally, customer data centers.
This deployment option is speciﬁc to customer-owned data centers and co-facilities.
Google Distributed Cloud also includes a hosted mode to run sensitive workloads
and address data, sovereignty, security, and privacy requirements. It does not require
connectivity to Google Cloud at any time to manage infrastructure, services, APIs or
tooling. You have the choice to manage it yourself, or host through a designated
trusted partner.
Back to you, Thomas.
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
Thank you, Ines. Partners like HPE, Dell, Cisco and NetApp are key as we deploy
Google Distributed Cloud globally on best-of-class hardware. I am pleased to
announce the expansion of our partnership with NetApp in two important ways. First,
NetApp is our primary partner supporting Google's Distributed Cloud storage
infrastructure. Second, for customers using Google Cloud VMware Engine, they now
have preview access for NetApp Cloud Volumes.
We are the only hyperscaler to provide customers with this choice. Deep
partnerships with T-Systems and Thales have also enabled us to address the evolving
sovereignty requirements for Cloud technology in Germany and France. The next
question we hear is, how can we provide the best environment to help employees
create and innovate together, especially in a hybrid workplace?
Hybrid is redeﬁning how we all work, making it less about where we work, but more
about the quality of our experience. Studies estimate that more than 48% of
employees will work remotely post-COVID. Google Workspace is the best platform
for hybrid Work with Simple, powerful and secure tools to help people communicate
and collaborate with one another, no matter where they are.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 12 of 64We introduced Smart canvas to help content creators remove friction from work
ﬂows and enable teams to stay connected outside of meetings to foster well-being
and reduce video call fatigue. We made communication and Collaboration
completely seamless.
For instance, users can easily present and collaborate in meetings, create meeting
notes from the Calendar, present in Meet directly from Docs, Sheets or Slides, and
collaborate directly from Chat and Spaces. We optimize collaboration from all
mobile devices to provide great experiences for frontline workers, who make up
80% of the global workforce.
One of America's largest hospital systems, CommonSpirit Health, is advancing its
patient care mission during the pandemic by making its frontline doctors and nurses
productive with Google Workspace. Since hybrid work has removed the notion of a
physical location for work, Google Workspace created Spaces, a uniﬁed digital
location for work.
Today, more than 3 billion users move securely and seamlessly between Mail, Chat,
Audio, Video and now Spaces. And you, too, can choose among the over 5,300
public apps in our marketplace and you can also add thousands of private apps to
enhance your workspace.
Now, I want to step aside for just a minute and tell you about a hidden secret in our
portfolio products. AppSheet. Our local platform that makes it easy for everyone, not
just professional developers, to build amazing apps and workﬂows.
For instance, property managers at Crawford Properties [ph] use the AppSheet to
build a mobile app to log, track, and resolve problems with headquarters. Replacing
a multi-step manual process. We're also partnering with Citrix, because employees
sometimes need access to windows and Mac OS applications and desk tops, directly
served from the cloud. We're expanding our partnership with Citrix today to deliver
an integrated desk top as a service solution, purpose built on Google Cloud.
Now customers ask us, do we know that our data, systems and users are secure? And
how do we keep them secure in the future? You know, as more digital users access
more data from more locations, the risk of cyber security breaches is accelerating. By
pioneering new approaches to security, Google keeps more people safe online than
anyone else in the world.
Take, for instance, JetBlue. It's keeping its systems secure, protecting the data of all
its travelers, and modernizing its security operations using Chronicle to detect
threats across petabytes of security telemetry, and eliminating data blind spots.
Commerzbank, one of Germany's largest banks, is using our new Certiﬁcate
Authority Service to verify machine and workload identity, improving security,
simplifying operations and eliminating entire classes of threats. Secure-by-defaultFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

the core of our services and our operations, enabling you to trust nothing.
Second, we have built cloud-scale threat detection and response, allowing you to
detect everything. And third, we know it's not just about tools. We provide the
advisory services you need to transform security operations. We keep customers safe
with BeyondCorp Enterprise which enables Zero Trust Access for all users. Today,
we're expanding Beyond Corp to all your applications, modern and legacy, Web and
desk top, and even to production environments.
We keep customers safe by eliminating software supply chain vulnerabilities. Over
the past two decades, we pioneered an approach to secure our own software supply
chain. We are now making that technology available through the SALSA open source
framework, and as managed services in our cloud to help you secure your own
software supply chain.
We keep customers safe by integrating chronicle's threat detection capability, with
our security Command Center, allowing you to respond faster to potential risks. And
we keep customers safe by bringing our security expertise to you with our Google
Cybersecurity Action Team, a team of our leading security experts who can help
shape your security transformation, from your very ﬁrst implementation, through
responding to a major incident, and engineering new solutions as needs change.
Finally, we continue to expand our secure ecosystem, with companies like Fortnet,
Palo Alto Networks, Thales, and so many more. Today, I would like to welcome a new
security partner, Cybereason, with whom we are collaborating to deliver a new
extended detection and response oﬀering that will combine Chronicle's capability
with Cybereason's MalOps engine for faster, easier threat detection and response.
Our products, our new Cybersecurity Action Team and our partnerships all make the
world safer from cyber threats. To talk more about how we help keep each and every
one of you secure, and how we're addressing some of the most important
challenges facing our world, I'd like to invite Sundar back. Thank you.

Thank you, Thomas. Security is top of mind for businesses of all sizes, as well as the
public sector. And despite the progress that has been made in cybersecurity, large
scale breaches continue to make headlines.
That's why, in August, Google announced we will invest $10 billion over the next ﬁve
years to strengthen cybersecurity. That investment includes expanding zero-trust
programs, helping secure the software supply chain, and enhancing open-source
security.

and brings together Google Workspace with Titan Security Keys, BeyondCorp, and
other secure technologies, products and partners.
Now every kind of organization and business can access the same security
protections that make work safer at Google. Security is an issue that aﬀects us all.
And this brings us to the last question Thomas posed. Are we addressing the most
important challenges facing our world? Climate change is one of the most profound
challenges we face, and it will take all of us working together to solve it.
Sustainability has been a core value for us for more than two decades.
Google has been carbon neutral since 2007, and we've matched our operations with
100% renewable energy over four consecutive years. Last year, we set out to make
our third decade of climate action our biggest yet. That included a bold commitment
to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy across our oﬃces and data centers by 2030.
And last week, we announced new ways we're helping one billion people make
more sustainable choices. When it comes to enterprises, one of the most important
sustainability choices is where to run your technology. IDC predicts Cloud
migrations, over the next four years could reduce carbon emissions by over 1 billion
metric tons or the equivalent of removing 200 million cars oﬀ the road for a year.
We are proud that Google Cloud is the cleanest cloud in the industry. Earlier this
year, we introduced a way for customers to choose the cleanest regions to run their
workloads. Today, we are expanding our portfolio of solutions and partnerships to
help reduce your carbon footprint.
First, we are focused on giving you greater transparency around carbon emissions
data. We are announcing carbon footprint, a new service to measure, track, and
report the gross carbon emissions associated with your Google Cloud usage. Having
this data at your ﬁngertips is really important. And we know that many customers
track sustainability data in other places. That's why I'm happy to announce that
Google Cloud emission data will integrate directly into Salesforce's Sustainability
Cloud.
We also want to give you the tools to act on that data. So today, we're introducing a
new tool that will alert you when you have idle workloads and make
recommendations to reduce carbon emissions. It's all part of our goal to help make
your Cloud transformation secure and sustainable, and solve for what's next.
So on behalf of Thomas and myself, let me thank you once again for trusting us to be
a partner with you on this journey. And we hope you enjoy the next three days.
Thank you.

Gerrit KazmaierHello and welcome to our very ﬁrst spotlight. I hope you enjoyed the opening
keynote. For the next hour, we will be diving in to all things data. I'm Stephanie
Wong, a developer advocate, and I'm here with Gerrit Kazmaier, who leads
database, analytics, and BI solutions at Google Cloud.
Thanks, Stephanie. I am very excited to be here, and to share with everyone what we
have been working on. The team thought we start on the light side of things here,
and start with a joke. One of my favorite jokes, actually. So here it goes. A SQL Query
walks into a bar and approaches two tables and asks, can I join you? Okay. I guess I
guess we roll the video instead.

{BIO 19738557 <GO>}
And welcome back. So, what are we solving for today? This spotlight session is about
how to leverage data as your most strategic business asset, especially as you adapt
to and anticipate change.
Data has the power to transform stagnant businesses into proﬁtable ones, streamline
operations to improve people's lives, and identify areas of waste to radically reduce
unnecessary spending. It can be used to solve businesses and world problems, both
the simple ones and the ones that keep people up at night.
It has the potential to accelerate progress faster than a think tank or world summit.
And it's largely untapped. As you learn more about Google Cloud capabilities and
make progress on your data Cloud journey, you can unlock your own 10X mindset as
external factors accelerate the pace of change.
Never before have we faced this much uncertainty, and now is the time when every
company can turn data into an ability. The reality today is that too many companies
struggle to remove the barriers to turn data into intelligence.
This is exactly what we are seeing with our customers, turning data into intelligence
and delivering value is no longer a nice to have. It is essential. A recent study shows
that only 32% of the companies surveyed gain value from their data investments, and
this is the result of diﬃcult-to-access, slow, unreliable, complex and fragmented
systems.
Many companies just feel overwhelmed with the demand for the various types of
working with data and of doing it at scale. They feel walled in with a lack of
integration, a lack of openness, a lack of portability, and very poor APIs.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

Gerrit KazmaierIt is time to re-imagine our data cloud strategy that is unlocking your data advantage.
Build great applications that understand and interact with your customer, and
operational databases that scale to billions of queries per second, react on any event
in real times and process millions of data streams, analyze petabytes of data without
sizing or tuning your data warehouse anymore, and ultimately, optimize your
processes with hundreds of machine learning models in production.
This is how you unlock your data cloud and unlock your data advantage. To build
your data cloud, you need your systems to be simple. And this requires a partner
that meets you where you are today and helps you to mature where you want to be,
but at your own pace.
Making the complex simple is our business. It has been for decades, building
systems that mask the complexity of the entire internet behind a simple, single
interface, and building applications with billions of users. It all runs on data and
analytics. So, you can say that data is our DNA, and we can't predict the future, but
we can plan for it.
And we are deeply grateful to work with tens of thousands of organizations who built
their data clouds on Google Cloud and unlocked ultimately their data advantage
from databases to analytics to streams to lakes to AI, and built a uniﬁed data cloud
together with us.
{BIO 19738557 <GO>}
It's leaders like you who are accelerating their use of data to transform complexity
into simplicity. This week at Next, you'll hear from leading organizations that have
chosen Google Cloud for their data Cloud strategy over market alternatives.
Verizon Media is one of these customers. Verizon uses BigQuery and Looker to scale
their massive enterprise media warehouse, supporting monthly scans of more than
one exabyte of data. The performance improvements include 90% plus productivity
improvements across the board and lower overall TCO compared to other cloud
providers.
Almost overnight, traﬃc to Chess.com tripled. The pandemic and successful series,
"The Queen's Gambit" created a perfect storm. Ten years' worth of growth occurred
in just six months, and daily active users rose from 280,000 to more than one million.
There's no way to handle that surge without the move to Google Cloud. Using
BigQuery's near inﬁnite ability to scale in response to demand, this meant that
Chess.com didn't have to forecast site traﬃc and worry about unexpected surges or
waste money by over-provisioning servers that go unused.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

Organizations like Cardinal Health are solving complex challenges with Google
Cloud. But what is holding others back from using data to accelerate innovation?
Companies are looking for solutions that can simplify their data landscape to move
from a state where every scenario requires a new tool to an agile platform that
combines data analytics, databases, data engineering and science, security and
governance into a single platform. To move from data at rest to a platform where
data is accessible in real-time.
Our vision is to provide a platform that allows data to unfold its full potential.
Ultimately, enabling us to reach new horizons ranging from newly built digital
experiences, products and business models could advance machine learning and AI
to ultimately empowering humans to reason beyond their own biological capacity.
And we have built the industry's most simple, intelligent and best integrated cloud
data platform that enables businesses to fuel their own digital transformation. And
this is how you unlock your data advantage, to seize new opportunities, improve
operational eﬃciencies and deliver new use experiences that delight customers,
partners and your employees.
Thanks to you, our customers and partners, Google's data platform is one of the
fastest growing clouds fueled by the demand for products like BigQuery. And here
comes the most exciting part. Today, we are excited to announce a number of new
product innovations. And the ﬁrst announcement goes out to all of the data
engineers in the world who are using Spark on Google Cloud.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

follow an open approach that enables ﬂexibility and choice. And today, I'm excited
to announce Project Big Spark. It is the world's ﬁrst autoscaling serverless Spark
service in existence. And regardless of whether you are a BigQuery user, a Dataproc
user or a cloud AI user, we have created an integrated ecosystem around Spark that
the factor standard for data engineering workloads.
We want to make it easy for you to onboard on our platform of Spark and never limit
your ambition with data science and data engineering.
{BIO 19738557 <GO>}
Our long history in the open source community has shown us that betting on the
community ﬁrst is always the right strategy to give our customers portability and
optionality. We're excited to make Spark a ﬁrst-class citizen on our platform and to
automate the productionalization of your data engineering and data science
workloads.
The next announcement goes to all of the data scientists. As enterprises consolidate
their data platforms, the distinction between advanced analytics and data science
and machine learning is really diminishing.
Today, more than ever, data scientists are looking for uniﬁed interface to be able to
seamlessly connect their entire data estate, and also run all explorations with SQL,
Spark and auto machine learning libraries. With Vertex AI, we have simpliﬁed the
experience for data scientists with 80% less code required to train a model
compared to any other platform.
As a product of Google's Vertex AI's credit sheet, I am happy to announce the
preview of AI Notebook for Vertex AI that oﬀers a fully managed, scalable and
enterprise-grade IDE combined with easily enforceable policies and user
management.
{BIO 19738557 <GO>}
These AI Notebook innovations are great examples of Google bringing together the
power of data and AI. Google truly aims to fast-track innovation by eliminating the
need for data scientists to shift context between aspects like data analytics, data
science and machine learning.
That is right on. And here is an exciting announcement to all of the developers. We
are adding a Postgres interface for Spanner, which continues our commitment to
openness and reinforces our eﬀorts to democratize the access to Spanner.
With this new Postgres interface, enterprises can take advantage of Spanner's
unmatched global scale, ﬁve 9s of availability, and strong consistency using skills andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

Spanner database that uses PostgreSQL dialect and connect with its open wire
protocol. This interface supports Spanner's rich feature set using the most popular
Postgres data types and SQL features, and thus, democratizing access to Spanner for
millions of developers out there.
Our commitment to the ecosystem has been longstanding with ongoing support for
Cloud SQL, for MySQL, Postgres, and SQL Server, so you can lift and shift your
databases. Our mission with Cloud SQL is compatibility, and we were the ﬁrst cloud
provider to support Postgres 13.
{BIO 19738557 <GO>}
These announcements are so exciting because Postgres has emerged as a popular
choice for operational databases. Postgres is known and loved for its stability and
feature set and has built an active and growing ecosystem of developers and tools.
Our investments in Postgres are a step in the right direction to continue meeting
developers where they are with the tools they love.
We are excited to announce new ways to help organizations going beyond
traditional business intelligence to analyze, access and act on data. Looker continues
to integrate with the other oﬀerings in our portfolio, as well as continues to innovate
with our core product.
And to address the needs, we are continuing to simplify the experience across
BigQuery, Looker and Data Studio, together with Connected Sheets. Today, we are
announcing new enhancements which bring the reality of augmented analytics to
more people with Looker solution for Contact Center AI to help businesses leverage
AI and converse naturally with customers and deliver outstanding experiences.
We are also announcing a new Looker Block for healthcare NLP AI, which creates a
user interface to advance AI and natural language functionality, and this helps
healthcare providers to gain deeper understandings of their patient data.

Part of the secret sauce lies in Looker's in database architecture and semantic layer
which makes it possible for business users to trust data no matter how they
experience it via a dashboard, E-mail or text alert or even a custom application.
We are excited for these recent innovations, but we couldn't do this alone. Together
with our community of customers, partners and developers, we are delivering

In order to do this, we're going to need the whole data team. Say hi, everybody.

Okay. Okay. You're actually joining us for our weekly stand-up at Cymbol Superstore,
a ﬁctional U.S.-based grocery chain focused on sourcing from local producers. Like
many diﬀerent industries, we need to bring in together disparate data sources to
build resilience.
Speciﬁcally, for us, drought in the western U.S. has impacted our producers, and our
supply chain has been disrupted with decreased shipments week over week. We
need to better understand how to manage inventory to prevent stock-outs, and
ensure we can scale in both how we analyze information and how we run our
transactions.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

A - Leigha JarettAll right, team. So, to address this supply and scale challenges that Nikita just
mentioned, we have four diﬀerent workloads. First, I'm going to evaluate the best
climate information to identify at-risk producers. Then, Brad will mature our data
pipelines to transform that data. Next, Derek will dig into scaling our transaction
processing. And ﬁnally, Nikita will show how we're gaining new insights by evolving
our data science capabilities.
Let's get into it and let's keep hearing from all of you out there, our data pros.
Leigha, you're up ﬁrst.
Great. Thanks, Nikita. So, in order to gain insight into our supply chain, ﬁrst, I need to
evaluate the risks. So, I'm focusing on ﬁguring out how drought impacts the very
source of our grocery products. And to do this, I turn to Google's platform for earth
science data and analytics, Earth Engine, which has a huge catalog of satellite
images for things like climate, weather, crop lands and much more.
There's currently over, like, 50 petabytes of data in the catalog. Plus, more and more
images are added each day. So, let me just go ahead and bring up this cool little
application that I built using the Earth Engine Code Editor so I can walk you through
the three datasets we'll be using today.
First is going to be crop data from the USDA NASS Program, which I can grab right
from the public data catalog by searching. This dataset is going to contain one
image of the U.S., here, going back all the way to 1997. And each ten-meter pixel in
this image has actually been assigned a crop type.
Let me just close that. The second dataset contains the outline of agricultural ﬁelds
and we're going to use Earth Engine to assign each one of these ﬁelds the crop type
that is most prevalent among the sales that cover it. So, in this view that I'm showing
right here, the pink ﬁelds are alfalfa and the dark green ﬁelds are almonds.
Leigha, these visuals are super helpful, but can we export this data for analysis in
other environments?
Yes. I'm actually going to push this into Cloud Storage and BigQuery in just a sec.
But ﬁrst, I want to add in some additional signals on drought.
So, this third dataset that I'm using is a collection of both short and long-term
drought indicators, meaning that we can see what drought looks like for each ﬁeld
time. Now, using datasets like this does require some deep subject-matter expertise.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 24 of 64A - Brad MiroSo, special thanks to our real-world partners at Climate Engine who build solutions
on top of Earth Engine's API, helping organizations ground their analytics projects
with scientiﬁcally accepted methodologies.
Okay. So, you just saw how we used geospatial data and I want to know how you use
it in your analysis. So, go ahead and answer that poll so we can see. All right,
everyone. So, with these layers in place, we can start exploring drought risk. Let me
just go ahead and zoom to this ﬁeld.
And here, I'm going to show an almond orchard northeast of Modesto, California
and overlooking that is the long-term drought indicator. So, this orange tint that
you're seeing means that this ﬁeld has experienced pretty high levels of drought
over the last ﬁve years.
Now, if I go ahead and just zoom out a bit, we can actually see that the entire Central
Valley in California is pretty drought stressed. So, my last step was to calculate
drought risk for each of the ﬁelds I showed before and this will tell us which farms
and produce types are potentially at risk for not meeting customer demand, which is
just one consideration to inform symbols resilient strategy.
Better yet, we can incorporate this geography data with other spatial stuﬀ like store
and customer locations that are already inside of BigQuery. And anyone who knows
me knows that I love BigQuery. If you agree, let me see in the emojis.
All right. So, the code editor has been great for interacting with Earth Engine, but
making these calculations at scale requires a diﬀerent approach. So, I went ahead
and created Earth Engine tasks for batch processing to run these calculations over all
the data in ﬁve-day increments for 10 years.
I also set up a cloud function to run every ﬁve days going forward so that we'll always
have fresh data. Now, just as a quick recap, we jumped into Earth Engine to evaluate
earth science data that indicates climate risk for our farm ﬁelds.
Now, we'll have fresh drought data available in Cloud Storage. So, just think of the
power of integrating huge amounts of specialized data giving us a complete picture
of supply risk for our business.
And I think I can see the poll results coming in now. It looks like lots of people are
using geospatial data for all diﬀerent kinds of things, and if your answer wasn't in the
poll, just go ahead and let us know in the chat.
So next up, Brad will transform and push this data into BigQuery for geospatial
analysis with our existing data. So, Brad, over to you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

A - Leigha Jarett
A - Brad MiroOkay. That was pretty cool, Leigha. Thanks. All right. So, to gain more insight in to
how drought is impacting production, my main focus has been building out the data
transformation pipeline to push farm ﬁeld drought indicators from Cloud Storage
into BigQuery.
Speaking of batch processing, as you know, to assist with inventory management,
price optimization and product assortment, we use Spark to standardize our large-
scale data processing and we Google Cloud Dataproc as our long-running clusters.
For you Dataprocs out there, we'd love to know how you're using Spark today. So, let
us know while I go ahead and pull up the Cloud Console. So, here is a Dataproc
cluster we currently use to schedule high Spark gaps. (Technical diﬃculty) cluster
with price bar code. This code is typical boiler plate code, right, to do basic data
transformations.
In this case, we are processing the Earth Engine ﬁles from Cloud Storage performing
type checking and mapping to ensure proper ingestion into BigQuery using the
Spark BigQuery Connector.
Okay. So, this is pretty cool, but I think having a batch work ﬂow that's scheduled on
a continuously running cluster seems like it can be kind of wasteful. So, is there any
way we can make this more eﬃcient?
That's a fair point, Leigha. There is still some overhead in management here, and for
hardened batch cases like this, it would be preferred to have these jobs run on their
own discrete resources.
Good news, with the new serverless option for Dataproc, we can submit a price work
job without spitting up any infrastructure. These automagic [ph] capabilities, I can
spend more dev time writing code and less time on managing infrastructure.
All right, Brad. First oﬀ, I'm pretty sure that you just set me up for that, and second,
you deﬁnitely made up that word, automagic.
Yes. But can I get some emoji love for that? Anyway, I'll now go ahead and export
this notebook to a Python ﬁle using NB convert. Okay. And next, let's go and use the
Cloud SDK to submit a serverless price Spark job. We can use the Dataproc API and
call batches to submit a serverless job.
So, I'm showing you here a price Spark job but I can also submit Spark jobs in
(inaudible) or SQL. With auto provision and auto scale, no infrastructure
conﬁguration is needed. This helps (technical diﬃculty) powerful distributed dataFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

clusters.
So, once I've submitted (technical diﬃculty) some long-term gap data and then
some (technical diﬃculty) to a new solution for creating long running clusters or a
place where our infrastructure team can manage Dataproc clusters. Now, fortunately,
we feel that Spark and GKE is our use case and let's just utilize our existing GKE
infrastructure.
So, clearly, it's been a busy week for me using Spark serverless to create pipelines to
push drought data into BigQuery. But the eﬃciency and improvement we'll gain but
not needing to manage cluster overhead will be worth it. Now, you can let me know
in the chat if you're as excited about Spark serverless as I am.
Okay. Let's see how everyone's using Spark today. Looks like notebooks are pretty
popular.
And automation through air ﬂow. That's cool, too. Okay. Great. Thanks so much,
Brad. So, now that we have greater insight into supply risks, we need to scale our
transaction systems to handle more orders and allow us to understand the potential
business impact of these climate risks while hopefully while lowering costs.
So, this brings me to Derek, DBA. Derek, you've been focusing on this eﬀort. So, can
you let us know where you're at today?
Yes. Absolutely, Leigha. We have a new grocery chain that has struggled to maintain
their on-prem databases as they've grown. There's an opportunity to solve their
underlying scaling problems with Cloud Spanner. I spent the last few weeks
validating Spanner's ability to scale and the ease of maintenance while keeping
strong consistency for this point of sale workload.
I migrated some of the new chain stores to Spanner already. Using granular instant
sizing, I only provisioned a portion of a Spanner node to handle the required load.
As we move the remainder of stores, we can easily scale up without down time or
app changes.
Quick question, Derek. We've been really focused on reducing the cost and
complexity of building scalable applications. So, I'm wondering how does adding
Spanner impact that eﬀort?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

Page 27 of 64A - Leigha Jarett
A - Derek Downey
A - Nikita NamjoshiYes. That’s a great question, Nikita. One way we've been doing this in other
environments is to standardize on Postgres. Postgres is a well-established open
source database with an active ecosystem that our development and ops teams are
already familiar with.
I tried to get the team to add an elephant emoji so you all could show some love for
Postgres, but anyway. Spanner just announced the PostgreSQL interface. This gives
us the beneﬁts of Spanner without having to complete retrain our application teams.
Having this data will help us maintain velocity for new features, even as our database
needs evolve. Here. Let me show you. So, I've connected into our Spanner instance
using the PSQL command line tool. From here, I can explore the schema, just like I
would in any other database, any other Postgres database.
You can see that both the Postgres data type and the Spanner data type is available
to the information schema. So, this will make it familiar to anyone who already knows
Postgres.
Awesome. Thanks, Derek. This is really cool (technical diﬃculty) for the scalability that
this is going to bring our team.
Absolutely. And as a quick summary, I highlighted how Spanner allows us to get
started small and scale as needed using granular instant sizing, and how the new
PostgreSQL interface reduces friction for our teams already familiar with Postgres.
Nikita and Leigha, using existing data is golden and I'll keep onboarding more
stores. Nikita, I believe you need this data for some of the BigQuery analysis you
were working on. You've been busy ﬁguring out how to evolve our ability to make
sense of all this data. Can you show us how that works?
Yes. Absolutely. I was hoping that you'd ask. So, to ensure that we're managing stock
to meet customer demand, my focus this week was on evolving our data science
case for exploratory analysis. I combined the transactional data that Derek has been
working on with the job data that Leigha and Brad pushed into BigQuery. This way,
we can gain insight into which products are most at risk of not meeting customer
demand.
So, my ﬁrst step was to integrate all of our transactional data within BigQuery,
primarily using federation with Cloud SQL and Spanner. This provides a uniﬁed
environment for aggregation and analysis where we can join transactions back to
producer details and the associated drought risk scores.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

A - Nikita NamjoshiNow, as you all know, we recently migrated to workbench, which has really, really
helped with our basic compute and resource management.
Quick question, Nikita. Is Vertex AI Workbench (technical diﬃculty)?
That is an excellent question, Derek. Vertex AI Workbench contains recently updated
managed notebooks to bring forth more integrated data engineering capabilities
into our data science environments. So, we can ingest and analyze data and deploy
and manage ML models all from one spot.
Now, let me show you a little bit about what this makes. After I provisioned the new
managed notebook, my ﬁrst task was to analyze the demand on the high-volume
SKUs and for that, I used the BigQuery connector to view and query the sales data.
With Vertex AI Workbench, I can inspect BigQuery metadata, preview tables, and
automate basic SQL construction entirely from my notebook environment. Okay. It's
my turn on the emojis. I want to see the ﬁre emoji for (technical diﬃculty) who are as
excited as I am about being able to access BigQuery from the notebook interface.
Looks like I'm not the only one.
Hey, Nikita, hold on. Sorry to interrupt your emoji fest, but I see you're working out of
the lakes project but are able to pin other projects you have access to like the ops
project. Is that new?
Yes. That's correct, Brad. Vertex AI Workbench actually enables me to interact with all
services via my own identity. The BigQuery plug-in also provides some templated
code to help build out queries and project results to pen this data frame.
So, here, we can see -- it looks like I just need to refresh. Sorry about it. I'm just going
to refresh my JupyterLab instance here. I guess I had it open for too long.
And I guess while Nikita is doing that, like who uses Jupyter now? Let's see the ﬁre
emojis lighting up. I see some now. I personally use it a lot in my day-to-day.
All right. Thanks, Leigha. So, perfect. You can see a simple view of all transactions by
the day of week. And Vertex workbench actually also allows me to launch diﬀerent
kernels entirely in the same instance. So, Brad, I think you are working out of a price
Spark notebook earlier, is that correct?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

A - Nikita NamjoshiYes. So, the data (technical diﬃculty) at the back end as a part of Spark on Google
Cloud. We can access all supported kernels on the cluster, including high Spark.
Well, from my analysis, I just needed a Python kernel. So, let me show you what's
going on in this notebook and what I've been up to this week. You can see here that
I've done a deep dive into the data. I plotted the transaction volume. I've created a
heat of purchase accounts across various departments (technical diﬃculty) the short-
term drought index across various crop types, like corn, dry beans, pears and rice.
But my last task, and the most important task, was to map SKUs to suppliers and
calculate a risk score based on the aggregate ﬁeld data. So, to do this, I started with
our mapping table, which you can see a sample of right here. This helped me to
determine (technical diﬃculty) and I calculated a weighted risk score that takes into
account each product's demand and the associated farms' overall drought risk, and
you can see each of these measurements in this data frame right here.
Ultimately, this goal will help us to prioritize managing items where we're most at risk
of not meeting customer demand. So, as a quick summary, I use (technical diﬃculty)
to connect active data accessible for query and create a weighted risk score for each
one of our products, combining both climate and demand data. Leigha, I went
ahead and put all of this back into BigQuery just to keep it centralized.
Awesome. Thanks so much, Nikita. That risk score is going to be huge in helping our
team understand supply risk. So, to make sure the broader team has a trusted view
of all this information, I started incorporating everything into a Looker dashboard.
Now, with Looker, we deﬁne our metrics like average risk using LookML, Looker's
data model, and Looker uses this to compile SQL queries and send them back to
BigQuery on our behalf so that our non-technical users can explore the results of
these eﬀorts.
So, let me show you this dashboard that I've been working on. And ﬁrst oﬀ, you can
see this custom map layer that I use to visualize drought risk across farm regions in
the west and we're able to take (technical diﬃculty) geospatial functions and drill
from this aggregate view all the way to producer or even grocery prepped level. Let
me show you.
So, I'll drill to ﬁelds ID and then I can jump right in to Looker's explorer to bring in
some more (technical diﬃculty). Maybe I want to speciﬁcally look at products that are
at risk in this region where we're quickly expanding.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

A - Brad Miro
A - Derek DowneyMaking all this data accessible to the broader team is really important. So, can we
make sure that the marketing team is aware of this so that they know how to hold oﬀ
on coupons or advertisements for these products?
Yes. Actually, we can set up a schedule from Looker so that the regional marketing
teams are always notiﬁed if new products seem to go at risk. So, putting this all
together, we used Earth Engine to process new earth science data signals. We used
Spark [ph] to eﬃciently transform geospatial data and push drought indicators into
BigQuery, Spanner to scale our transaction systems, ensuring we have the
infrastructure to handle future growth, and Vertex AI Workbench plus Looker backed
by the power of BigQuery to evolve our data science capabilities and service
important trends back to key decision makers.
So looking across the services, anyone is able to explore and take action on insights
that combined climate data and transactions. Now, we can understand where
products may go out of stock due to increasing drought conditions, and identify
areas to build resilience against changes in our climate. So with this geospatial
information we're given a whole new set of data so that we can not only be
considerate of our customers, but also ﬁnd ways to be more considerate of our
planet.
And with that, it looks like we're right about at time. So thank you so much for joining
us today as we've shown how Google Cloud can oﬀer a world-class experience for
creating a scalable, uniﬁed data platform. And a special thanks to my colleagues,
Nikita, for showing us Vertex AI Workbench, Derek for introducing us to Spanner and
its Postgres interoperability, and Brad for walking us through Spark on Google
clouds.
And thank you, Leigha, for showing us Looker and Earth Engine. Last but certainly
not least, thank you all out there so much for your engagement. We love those
emojis and seeing all of your comments in the chat. So stay tuned for our live Q&A
which is going to cover everything from our spotlight through this demo.

Thanks o much data cloud team. What a cool demo. I'm Dane Hanson. Welcome,
everyone. I'm the director of Product Marketing for Data Cloud. Joining me today is
Gerrit Kazmaier. Gerrit?
Hey, Dane. I'm Gerrit. I'm the Vice President of Data Analytics, Databases and Looker.
And I do look forward to everyone's questions.
I do too. A reminder that this Q&A is live, you can engage with us directly. So ask
your questions, say hi in the chat, hit those emojis, and if you can't, just go
(inaudible) the Experience button.
So let us jump right in. But before we do, I do want to see what you would like most
today. So we have some quite exciting set of announcement, and is it for you Let's
go BigQuery, is it Big Spark It Up, Postgres For All on Spanner, or is it Show Me the
Earth Engine?
So while we wait for those results, tell me, Gerrit, what are you most excited about?
I'm really excited about two things; openness, and simplicity. All of our
announcements were made to make data more accessible, more simple to use from
Postgres for Spanner, from cross-cloud analytics with Omni, from serverless arch
from Looker and Tableau, everything is in the spirit of making data simple to work
with and creating an open ecosystem around GCP for working with data.
That's right. And being open and simple is really what it's all about and that's what
we saw from the demo as well. Just as a reminder that our friends from the live demo
are sticking around to help answer the questions. So you might see their faces
throughout the show. It's like we've got some of the poll results. It's all about the
BigQuery, look at those hearts come in. So this is really good.
It's Let’s Go BigQuery.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

A - Dane HansonAll right. So let's get into our ﬁrst question, it's from Tiana [ph]. She asked about the
availability of Earth Engine. We saw the great demo earlier from the team. How can
folks get their hands on this? How can they access it? And another follow-up
question which is how does it work with BigQuery GIS?
Awesome. Hey, Tiana, awesome question. So ﬁrst of all, Google Earth Engine is now
in preview, which means that you can go to google.com/earthenginepreview and
register, and we will be reaching out to you to set you up with an account.
The second key piece of what you've seen earlier is that; A, in Earth Engine, you have
a data lake of satellite imagery, and you get the means to do geospatial analysis on
imagery data. And that results, they can be brought into BigQuery to match them up
with all of the data you have residing there or using BigQuery ML, for instance, as we
have seen. So all in all, awesome packets, a lot of data and a great integration
directly back into BigQuery.
I love this. And it's really what only Google can provide, with the best of our data and
the best of our analytics solution. This is a great solution.
That's exactly right.
So another question comes in from Chris, multi-cloud, look, this is an exciting area.
We just released BigQuery Omni as a general availability. That’s exciting. What are
Google’s plans around data management? Does it have plans, Gerrit, to expand our
multi-cloud approach to other data management services?
Great question, Chris. And I think it all starts from recognizing a basic fact, for the
majority of companies, multi-cloud is a reality. And when we talk about data silos, we
have to recognize that a modern data silo is a multi-cloud data silo. And at BigQuery
Omni, we wanted to bring simplicity to multi-cloud, which means that you can do
cross-cloud analytics. And we are constantly evaluating which of our data services
make sense in an omni-delivery, and basically following our customer scenarios,
where you are taking us to, and you can expect much more to come in that direction.
This is great. We really go forward with multi-cloud as more and more companies are
using that as their norm.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

Page 33 of 64A - Gerrit Kazmaier
A - Dane Hanson
A - Leigha Jarett
A - Dane Hanson
A - Gerrit KazmaierI think it's 90% of the companies that you surveyed actually say that multi-cloud for
them is the reality they are living in today. So that plays through that complexity and
delivers multi-cloud cross cloud analytics.
Okay, good, good. Thank you, Gerrit. Our next question comes in from Anon at CVS
Health. He asked this question to Leigha actually. So Leigha, is there any map that
reveals all the services? I think you might have shown this at the tail end of the demo,
but maybe you could go back and do sort of an overview about the visualizations,
the capabilities of Looker, how does Looker and BigQuery play a role with the
visualizations for that map of Earth Engine.
Awesome. Yes. Thanks, Dan. So basically, I think what this question is asking is if you
can visualize the actual semantic model that you're creating in Looker to connect all
your diﬀerent data assets. And actually, earlier this year, Looker launched the LookML
Diagram, which is available in Looker’s marketplace. So you can directly, in Looker,
create a visualization of your data models, whether your data is in BigQuery, Spanner
or other places that are connected to Looker. So check it out.
That's awesome. Thank you, Leigha. The next question comes in around our Cloud
SQL and Cloud Spanner capabilities. We oﬀer both capabilities today, as you know,
Gerrit, which one is for which purpose? Could you talk a little bit about how Spanner
is our fully-managed database service? What is your recommendation, what use
cases to use Cloud SQL as well as Cloud Spanner?
That is a great question because both of them are actually pretty awesome services.
Cloud SQL is really a managed service that you can decide whether you want
Postgres or MySQL. And it's really for those customers who want to leverage
basically perfect compatibility with the Postgres or the MySQL ecosystem, use all of
the packages, use everything which is around that type of system. And it's a really
highly reliable, high performance managed service that you're providing.
Spanner sits on the other end of the spectrum, if you like. It's a cloud native
database. It combines a unique set of abilities. It has ﬁve 9’s of availability that is
unheard of. It has global consistency. It's horizontally scaling, all of the things that
you want to use when you're building massively scaling global applications. And so
if you are looking on that spectrum, that's really about scale, and yet having strong
consistency, then Spanner is the way to go.
And the good news is, from today's announcement, that you can use Spanner with a
Postgres interface, which means that you don't need to relearn or take another toolFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

A - Nikita Namjoshiset chain in order to work with it. You can basically seamlessly apply your Postgres
skills, and go cloud native with Google Cloud Spanner.
That's awesome. Let me ask another question. It's about our recent partnership with
Tableau. This is pretty exciting partnership.
Yes.
We've done a lot with them. And could you talk a little bit about how this strategy
and this partnership help our Looker customers speciﬁcally,
It is really about simplicity and openness. This announcement means that if you are a
Tableau customer, you will be able to use Looker semantic models built and LookML
for trusted data access, for data governance, for high performance database access.
If you are a Looker customer, it means that you can add Tableau self-service data
visualization right onto your Looker scenario.
So the bottom line is that it makes very working with data more simple. It helps our
customers who are trying to ﬁnd the right balance between self-service and
ﬂexibility, and strong governance and semantics. It truly brings together the best out
of two worlds.
That’s great. And I think it's really a reﬂection of our open strategy for the data cloud.
Again, it brings more community, more customers, more use cases, more capabilities
that we can bring as part of one ecosystem.
That's exactly right.
That's awesome. The next question comes in from Andrew. It's speciﬁc and another
question to actually Nikita, about the live demo, we showed an integration of Vertex
AI. How does this work with BigQuery ML or BigQuery Machine Learning? Nikita,
could you take that question?
Absolutely. That's a great question. So for those of you who don't know what
BigQuery ML is, it basically allows you to build and train machine learning models
with just a few lines of SQL. So in the demo, we showed how you can use Vertex AIFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

interface, which I'm super excited about. So you could actually create and train your
ML models and SQL, and do all of this from the notebook interface, but still have that
connection to BigQuery and be able to use whatever tabular data you have stored in
your BigQuery.
Okay, that's awesome. Thank you, Nikita. Next question comes in from Jeﬀ, another
question on Looker. Could you talk a little bit about how the Looker is enabling these
new sets of API-driven experiences? Speciﬁcally, Jeﬀ is asking, what are the
considerations that we should have in place for the way we integrate it with other
tools that we should be using? Could you talk a little bit about how we can now
connect with Sheets? So there are some new things that we connect with Looker.
Hey, Jeﬀ, awesome question. And I do want to re-text it with the following statement,
Looker is going to be a key element of any data landscape. Basically, what Looker is
doing is giving you two amazing things. One is it gives you a model semantic layer.
Basically, you can describe your data landscape with very rich annotations. And this
semantic layer is connected directly to the database system. For instance, when it
runs on BigQuery, it completely delegates all of the queries right into BigQuery, so it
delivers stellar performance.
And Looker, as a whole, has a really amazing API ﬁrst concept, which means that it is
so beyond AI. It allows you to build data rich applications. It allows you to basically
renovate your customer experience, your websites, your internal applications and
make them really data rich.
And last but not least, we kind of gave it away here, we are also integrating more and
more products with Looker semantic model. For instance, we are adding connected
sheets as a way how you can analyze and discover data described in LookML. So
check it out. It's going to make a big diﬀerence in your landscape as well.
This is great. We are almost out of time, so we're just going to take one more
question before wrapping things up. The last question is from Gerard. He talks about
how, at USDA, many of the methods are using diﬀerent visualizations, so whether it's
Tableau or Esri. How does this complement our strategy with how we're connecting
all this data? It's over 50 petabytes of data. How do we connect all that data with
Earth Engine and enable all these diﬀerent ways to process it with these diﬀerent
tools?
Absolutely. Hey, Gerard, great question. So ﬁrst of all, it starts with making sure that
there is data, and with Earth Engine you get this amazing data lake of satellite
imagery and GIS data available to you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 36 of 64A - Dane Hanson
A - Javier SolteroThe second piece is that you need to have a powerful processing framework. And by
the integration to BigQuery, you can use the most scaling, the fastest warehousing
system on this planet to analyze this data alongside with all of the rest of your data,
of your business data.
And last but not least, like you said, it's about complete openness. The
announcements that we have share today with LookML allows you -- that you can
connect Tableau, connect to Sheets, Looker visualizations, all on top of that right tool,
and make sure that you are using the visualizations tool that you like the most.
But before we close it oﬀ, because I think we are out of time, Dane and I have a very
important message for all of you. And here it goes.
Right here. Thanks to Gerrit as well as our friends over on the demo set for
answering some great questions and it's really been awesome hearing from all of
you. Be sure to hop back over to the next website, Javier Soltero will share all the
great things happening with Google Workspace. Thanks so much for joining us.

{BIO 16235492 <GO>}
Hello, everyone. Welcome to Google Cloud Next. All right, we've had a lot of great
content so far, not to say I learned a lot just now watching the Data Cloud session. I
hope you're ready for even more. I'm Javier Soltero, vice president and general
manager for Google Workspace, and I'm super excited to be with you today.
Though, to be honest, I really was hoping we could all be in person by now.
Since ﬂexibility is one of the key themes for today, we'll embrace what we have to
work with, even if we can't be together. Although the last 18 months have been ﬁlled
with uncertainty, we continue to be inspired by customers and users who found new
ways to create and stay connected. Driving innovation and embracing change are
always challenges for every business, whether you're 10 people or 100,000. The goal
seems simple. Empower your teams to work eﬀectively together, in part, by ensuring
that your technology is an enabler, not a blocker.
As we've evolved Google Workspace, we've been focused on helping individuals,
teams and entire organizations drive innovation and greater impact with the tools
they use every day. And ﬂexibility has been foundational to our approach. It's why we
decided to not only be cloud ﬁrst, but cloud only. It's why we've always prioritized
user choice. It's why we take a zero-trust approach to security, and why we make sure
any product innovation we introduce is truly built for everyone.
And those principles are core to why our customers choose us. Millions of
companies, schools, government agencies and other organizations rely on Google
Workspace to help them navigate whatever challenges they may face. They're also a
big contributor to our own continued success as a business. Google has run on whatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 37 of 64is now Google Workspace for the last 15-plus years, and it's part of why we have
been able to continue to innovate and adapt as we scale.
In that time, we've grown to over 144,000 employees made 213 acquisitions, added
dozens of oﬃces around the world, and more than quadrupled the number of
annual searches we support. We've weathered changing market conditions and user
preferences, and competitive challenges just like any business, just like your
business.
One constant for us has always been our tools, which were designed to meet ever
shifting needs and circumstances. Today, we'll walk through some of the most
impactful innovations in our toolset that help unlock the full potential of individuals,
teams and organizations in a ﬂexible, more eﬀective hybrid workplace.
First, let's talk about collaboration. Eﬀective team collaboration powers creativity and
innovation. It's how people work towards shared goals, build team culture and are
able to achieve substantially more than they would on their own. With everyone's
time in such high demand and the explosion of collaboration tools giving us no
shortage of ways to reach one another and work together, collaboration can often
feel fragmented. Conversations and workﬂows scattered across disparate channels.
Now more than ever, the technology you choose should work intelligently and
eﬀectively across every medium to enable collaboration wherever it happens. Last
month, we introduced Spaces, the central place for ﬂexible team collaboration and
Google Workspace. Spaces are built to be tightly integrated with Calendar, Drive,
Docs, Sheets, Slides, Meet and Tasks to provide a uniquely better way for people to
engage in topic-based discussions, share knowledge and ideas, connect across
organizational boundaries and build team culture, all in the service of moving
projects forward.
In the same way that a group of people can accomplish more by working together,
our integrated experience is greater than the sum of its parts, helping people better
collaborate and manage their time and attention. By thoughtfully bringing together
collaboration surfaces and channels, the goal is to help people stop thinking about
where and focus instead on the what.
To continue investing in this area, we've been working with customers to understand
their needs, especially the changing circumstances we've all been facing. In line with
feedback we've gotten, we'll be adding inline topic threading, more powerful
search, robust security and admin tools for content moderation, and discoverable
spaces. We hope this makes it even easier for organizations and teams to both
proactively share and ﬁnd the knowledge they need to deliver greater impact.
Those of us working remotely realized early on how crucial it is to cultivate a sense of
human connection with our colleagues. No matter where or how we work, we all
need to be seen, heard and understood. Towards that end, in the last 18 months,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 38 of 64we've invested here in bringing functionality to Google Meet that makes connecting
virtually almost as natural and rewarding as connecting in person.
This includes AI-powered noise cancellation, low light mode, and live translated
captions, along with a new intuitive user interface complete with polls, Q&A and
breakout rooms that help make meetings more productive, inclusive and immersive.
With all of these improvements, we're seeing customers who previously opted to use
third party meeting solutions reconsider moving to Google Meet.
We've also invested in making our tools reﬂect the new ways people are working. To
support hybrid and distributed teams, we've added the ability to set working hours,
work location, and recurring out-of-oﬃce notiﬁcations from count. We also
introduced the ability to RSVP to a meeting with a virtual or in-person location. All
these investments are geared toward helping people better manage their time and
ultimately protect their well-being. Well-being has been a central focus for us at
Google over the past year, and for countless organizations supporting their
employees during this long period of remote work.
Two clear bright spots we've seen in pivoting to remote work have been; one, an
increased in empathy for our coworkers lives outside the oﬃce; and two, an
increased focus in collaboration equity, or the ability for everyone to participate
equally and fully. For more than a year, we've all been reduced to digital video tiles,
and it's had a democratizing eﬀect on meetings. We thought a lot about how we can
sustain this equity as more of us move into a hybrid model.
Next month, we're launching Companion Mode, which oﬀers a uniﬁed experience
for people in the oﬃce and their remote colleagues. Those in the oﬃce can still use
the best of in-room audio and video from Google-made hardware. But they can also
join the meeting using Companion Mode on their laptop. This lets them fully
participate in the meeting with access to chat, whiteboarding, Q&A and polls, along
with the ability to share content just as they would from home. We think it's
imperative to provide one uniﬁed meeting experience regardless of where and how
people connect.
And as more people head back into shared physical spaces, we're enhancing our
meetings hardware to give organizations greater choice and ﬂexibility. We have two
new all-in-one video conferencing devices, the Google Meet Series One Desk 27
and Board 65, with new standards of audio, video and whiteboarding capabilities
built in. These devices can turn any room or shared space into a collaboration hub.
We also have new third party devices coming to the Google Meet ecosystem,
including this Logitech Rally Bar and this new Rayz Rally Pro speaker dock that will
automatically launch Google Meet for video meetings and provide an improved
audio experience from a mobile device.
Lastly, we're partnering with Cisco to bring interoperability between our video
conferencing devices. So you'll be able to launch a Google Meet meeting on WebExFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

crucial in delivering on our vision of Google Workspace for everyone.
Last year, our focus was on introducing an integrated experience across our ﬁrst
party products. This year, we're prioritizing strengthening the platform that supports
and extends. This is so important, because our success is measured not only by how
people use and love our products, but by the ecosystem that thrives around them.
And what we're seeing in the numbers here is remarkable. Google Workspace has
more than 3 billion users, and a stunning 4.8 billion apps have been installed in
Google Workspace today. There are more than 5,300 public apps available in the
Google Workspace marketplace, plus thousands more private apps that customers
have built for themselves. It really shows what's possible when you combine great
ideas, easy to use APIs, and the ability to reach a user base that's 3 billion strong.
While users and developers have been able to build on apps like Gmail, Drive and
Docs for years, we're now in the process of making it just as easy to integrate with
Chat, Spaces and Meet. If Google Workspace is how it's done, then the Google
Workspace platform is how it’s integrated.
Miro has already announced their plans for integrating in Google Meet, and today
we're pleased to announce a new integration for Chat and Spaces from Atlassian.

Every team is unique. Each team has its own Snowﬂake, and they should be able to
use the best tools for the job. We focus on building the best-in-class collaboration
solutions, and then deeply integrating it with all the other tools that teams need to
get things done.

started?
{BIO 21998624 <GO>}
Yes. Today, Atlassian solutions already extend and connect with thousands of tools
from collaboration, chats, security, DevOps, and a whole lot more. And we're excited
to continue to extend our partnership with Google Workspace to deliver for our joint
customers. Work is everywhere. People’s chat and inboxes, it's all ﬂooded with work.
And to help turn that clutter to progress, we believe in integrating Trello and Jira,
and our other tools everywhere work is.
The Better Together integration helps Atlassian and Google customers to make
workﬂow across their organization. Rich content and easy actions help move work
forward. In fact, we are Workspace customers and this is what led us to dream up our
initial integrations. One of our ﬁrst launches together was the Trello integration in
Gmail, and that was back in 2017. Today, more than 7 million people have installed
that which is really impressive.
{BIO 16235492 <GO>}
That's awesome. Today, we're so excited to announce the new Jira bot that connects
to Google Chat to Spaces and enables users to create issues, monitor them, all
within the space that you're already using for collaboration.
{BIO 21998624 <GO>}
Well, Workspace is unique, and that it oﬀers such a signiﬁcant opportunity to reach
over 3 billion users. And today, Atlassian and Google have invested in a number of
Workspace products to help users work better together, whether that's unfurling
Google Five Links across Atlassian products, embedding an important Google Docs
and Jira Work Management, or creating new Trello cards from Gmail. But there's
more, and we'll continue to listen to our customers and then follow their needs.
{BIO 16235492 <GO>}
It's great to see the power of Jira built into Chat and to Spaces. It's such a powerful
example of how developers can build new experiences from across the platform,
from Gmail to Chat to Spaces to Drive. Thanks, Joﬀ. Really excited to have you here
with us and I'm very excited to continue to develop our partnership.

As we work with Atlassian and all our partners to build and deliver new experiences,
rest assured that every one of them is designed with security in mind, starting with a
zero-trust approach to identity in Google Workspace. We also employ a rigorousFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

Google Workspace marketplace.
Finally, we recognize that it's not always developers, but the person closest to the
problem who best understands how to make work more eﬃcient and impactful. To
better empower these users, we're providing them access to custom no code
AppSheet apps right from Gmail with dynamic email. This lets users interact with
data directly and securely from their inbox to get things done in powerful new ways.
This new experience is available today, and you'll see it in action in the upcoming
demo in a few minutes.
Now, we've talked about the powerful new experiences in Google Workspace and
the platform that surrounds it. But neither of those can transform the way your
organization works without a broader foundation for security. We've seen too many
headlines lately about data and security breaches, and it's a powerful reminder that
modern collaboration requires modern security.
Legacy collaboration tools were built for a bygone era. And these headlines make it
clear that a band aid approach to the security problem with legacy tools just doesn't
cut it. We built Google Workspace with modern collaboration and security in mind to
keep your people and your data safe.
Let's talk about what makes Google's approach unique. First, because we're cloud
only, we don't have the same vulnerabilities that legacy collaboration tools and
infrastructure have. With Google Workspace, there's no need for thick client
applications, email attachments, or on-prem identity directives, each of which
provide bad actors with too many opportunities for attack. And all our security
protections are included with Google Workspace, which means you don't need to
spend money on security add-ons, and you're less susceptible to supply chain
attacks.
Second, our entire platform is built on the BeyondCorp security model, which is
Google's unique approach to zero trust. This lets employees work securely from
anywhere on any device without the need for a clunky VPN.
Finally, we're best in class at automatically detecting and preventing attacks, from
phishing, to malware, to supply chain, to ransomware. Every day, we've about 15
billion spam messages, 100 million phishing attempts and 3 million deceitful URLs
from reaching our customers. All of this comes together to provide Google
Workspace customers with the most trusted way to connect, create and collaborate.
All right, now how are we working to enhance that security vision even further? Well,
I'm excited to announce some new capabilities that build on this unique approach to
security.
First, we've already made client-side encryption available in beta for Drive, Docs,
Sheets and Slides, and now we're bringing it to Google Meet as well. Client-sideFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 42 of 64A - Erika Trautmanencryption gives our customers complete control over the privacy and conﬁdentiality
of their data.
Next, we're introducing data loss prevention for Chat. You can think of this as part of
our promise to enable collaboration without compromise when it comes to security.
With data loss prevention in Chat, you can support spontaneous conversation while
preventing sensitive and conﬁdential information from leaking outside of your
organization. Admins can control what users share inside and outside their domain
on Google Chat, and they were alerted about any violations.
Finally, I'm excited to share the Drive labels is now generally available. This gives
organizations the ability to classify ﬁles stored in Drive based on their sensitivity
level. Labels also integrate with Google Vault and Google Workspace data loss
prevention to prevent external sharing, downloading and printing of sensitive ﬁles.
Just another example of how Google Workspace enables collaboration, while
providing the right controls to manage access and protect data.
So we've talked you through a lot today. And the common thread is that we're
continuing to build a modern productivity solution, one that seamlessly brings
together the right tools and the right way to help you more eﬀectively collaborate,
that supports hybrid and distributed work and that lets you extend and customize
solutions for your organization, and of course, one that's secure by design. It's a
platform that helps you unlock the full potential within your organization so that you
can innovate, even thrive amid the disruptions of today and tomorrow.
There will always be certain things that are out of our control, but with the right
people and tools in place, as we've seen ﬁrsthand with our customers, we can always
be prepared to eﬀectively adapt no matter what comes next. Though in this case, it
just so happens that I actually know what's coming next and it's our demo with Erika
Trautman, director of Product Management for Google Workspace. Stay tuned to see
what we just talked about come to life.
Hello, everyone. I'm Erika Trautman, product director for Google Workspace. There
has been a ton of innovation in Workspace this past year. And in the next 15 minutes,
I get to share with you all the progress we've made, helping teams of all sizes to
connect, create, and collaborate.
This demo has two parts. In the ﬁrst, I'll be showing you Workspace in action through
a little story that we've created. And then I'll hand it oﬀ to my colleague, Matt Izatt,
who will show you all the ways developers can build on the workspace platform.
And as a reminder, before we get started, this is truly a live session, so you never
know what's going to happen. If you haven't already, click the button that says Join
the Interactive Experience on the next website, and then we'll see you in the live
room where you can interact with chats, and do fun stuﬀ like take polls, which we're
going to try out right now. How many employees have you or your companyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

Page 43 of 64onboarded virtually this year? Let us know in the poll below, under 10, 11 to 25, 26 to
50, or more than 50.
I know that for me, recruiting and getting people in the door, that got harder during
the start of the pandemic, taking that brand new person that you work so hard to
ﬁnd, bringing them up to speed, making them feel like they're part of the team and
really enabling them to do great work those critical ﬁrst few weeks on the job. And of
course, it is so overwhelming to be that new hire. You're learning not just the role,
but the tools, the processes, the people, and the culture maybe remotely. So I want
to show you how workspace is making this easier.
Please meet our hero Pablo. He's in exactly this position. He's about to receive an
oﬀer letter from his dream employer Symbol manufacturing, which by the way, is not
a real company in case you are wondering, so don't go look it up. His hiring
manager Allison is going to help onboard him at the company. Allison is really, really
excited to get Pablo onboard, and there are a ton of steps in the process that she's
going to help him through.
So we'll show you how she uses Workspace to help streamline that experience for
both of them even when it requires using third party software or custom tool the
Symbol team built within Workspace. The point here, as Javier mentioned, is that
workspace is a platform that brings together the right tools in the right way, at the
right time, whether those tools are built by Google or someone else.
Okay, before we get back to Pablo’s and Allison's story, let's see what you have been
experiencing here in the poll. Wow, it looks like 48% of you say that you've
onboarded more than 50 people this year. That is a lot. So I think you are going to
be able to relate to Allison.
When you were recruiting and onboarding, what was the ﬁrst thing that you did? I
think probably you sent them an oﬀer letter and ﬁngers crossed, hope they signed it.
Allison uses the DocuSign integration in Google Docs to do just that. So here you
see, Pablo is going to check his personal Gmail on his mobile phone, and he just
scrolled past it, there's an oﬀer letter in there. He's going to click on that and open
up DocuSign right there within the email.
He clicks this. It's a nice cover letter Allison has sent him, clicks to open the
document itself. Okay, great, start date is right. They spelled his name right, salaries
what they talked about. I think he's going to accept. He signs the oﬀer letter with his
ﬁnger right there on his phone without leaving Gmail. Come on, Pablo, sign, sign.
And he signs and click Submit, and Allison, she's so relieved.
In other systems, Pablo might have had to stop what he was doing, open another tab
to review and sign the agreement, go back to Gmail, hopefully remember where he
left oﬀ. It's just unnecessarily disruptive if you're signing a single contract. But if
you're someone who reviews and signs contracts all the time, it's incredibly onerous.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 44 of 64So deep integrations with leading third party apps like DocuSign save you valuable
time and keep you focused on your core job.
Audience, if you have any favorite Google Workspace integrations, we would love it
if you would share those in the comments, because it's a great way to help everyone
who's out there, discover -- everyone who's there to discover the best of what's out
there.
All right, back at Symbol, when Pablo returned his oﬀer letter, that kicked oﬀ the
onboarding process. So let's see what happens next. Pablo is now at home on his
personal email and he sees an email from Allison come in at the top there. He opens
it, notices, this is not a typical email. This is an AppSheet dynamic email, which allows
him to interact with the forum without ever leaving his inbox. So what he's doing
here is selecting his laptop, accessory type, desk type, T shirt size, really important.
He enters his address, click Submit, and just like that, Symbol can now send him his
stuﬀ. This is especially important because Pablo is going to work remotely initially.
Just like with the DocuSign example, the dynamic email lets him complete his tasks
where he is in Gmail, saving him the time and hassle of toggling back and forth
between tabs and apps, just to ﬁll out a form. And by the way, if throughout any of
this, you have questions regarding dynamic emails or AppSheet, please comment
below so that we can address them in the Q&A.
Let's fast-forward to Pablo’s ﬁrst day on the job. He's received his equipment. He's
excited to work. He's in calendar, notices. We've got a one-on-one with Allison
coming up. He's going to click on that Calendar Invites and join the meeting with
Allison. Allison welcomes him to Symbol, oﬀers to give them a short overview of
calendar and meet. So here she's showing him how to set up his working location
and working hours, so that his colleagues who are global know when he's available
and when he's oﬀ.
Features like these, only available in Google Workspace, really improve employee
well-being and overall job satisfaction. They help employees better coordinate how
and when to work together, ensuring both productivity and time to recharge even
though our oﬃces might be in our bedrooms or our kitchens. Honestly, Pablo is
going to spend a lot of time in meetings. So Allison shows him all the great new
features that have been added to Meet over the past year.
The interface is new and easier to use. Here, she's showing him how to get into some
of the advanced features. He's deﬁnitely going to want to turn on noise cancellation,
which is great for ﬁltering out dogs barking or neighborhood construction. And if
you're having trouble hearing someone, you can just click on the Closed Caption
button to follow along in live captions, even in a diﬀerent language than what's
being spoken, which blows my mind. AI-powered translated captions in meetings
are launching soon, and only Google Workspace oﬀers this built-in for everyone.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 45 of 64There's also a host of new features which she's showing in here to boost
engagement. So chat polls, these magical little breakout rooms that she's going to
show that transport you to smaller groups where you can brainstorm, whiteboards,
integrations with Google Docs.
At this point, the one-on-one wraps up and Allison suggests he goes into Gmail and
start exploring the Spaces he's been added to. We've recently launched Spaces,
which are the evolution of Rooms in Google Chat, and they're the central place for
team collaboration in Google Workspace. Pablo looks at the team Space and noticed
his team has written him a bunch of welcome messages, which is really great. He
responds.
And now, he's going to browse the spaces that are available to him, and he
discovers one particularly relevant to his work, quality inspector managers North
America. Awesome, that's him. In this space, he can connect with his colleagues,
discuss ideas and collaborate on projects easily. Spaces are unique and that they're
tightly integrated with the entire Google Workspace product set. So Calendar, Drive,
Docs, Sheets, and Slides, Meet and Tasks, bring all the tools you need to engage in
topic-based discussions, share knowledge and ideas, move projects forward and
build communities and team culture.
Pablo notices there's a little bubble with Allison's image, which means she said him a
direct message, turns out this is public ﬁrst project and Allison shared a document
with him, which we can see in the preview here. Pablo opens the document and
notices his coworkers already pre-populated some of the core information, so
facilities, number of workers per facility on the ﬂoor and types of tasks that they
perform.
Pablo’s job is to optimize the process that managers use to create tickets and send
them to their quality inspectors on the frontline. Okay, to do this, at his prior
company, Pablo would have needed to secure IT assistance at a minimum, and more
probably a contractor and probably a budget to go build an app. So not fast, not
easy. Instead, Pablo is going to use AppSheet. He connects his sheets to AppSheet,
and after about an hour of customization, he's created a quality inspection app that
his team can use.
So he opens it up to ﬁle his ﬁrst ticket to one of his quality inspectors. Now what? All
right, over on the manufacturing ﬂoor, we meet Adu [ph], a quality inspector
reporting to Pablo, and he's just received a pop-up notiﬁcation on his phone with the
inspection ticket Pablo assigned to him. So he pulls up the AppSheet app that Pablo
created and performs the inspection. He's going to take a picture of the completed
job.
Let's get -- let's see if he get -- we can get him over there into the AppSheet app. He
noticed that he's got it, yes, there we go. All right, he's now in the app and you're
going to take a picture of the job once it's completed. He's going to annotate that
and submit it as closed, and that then will notify Pablo on Pablo’s side of the app.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

Page 46 of 64A - Matthew IzattSo hopefully, you saw how easy it was to make collaboration more eﬃcient between
an oﬃce and frontline worker. He used a really simple but powerful AppSheet app to
eliminate the whole back and forth between emails and chats, and then maybe
switching to an external ticketing system, and then more emails and more app --
more chatting.
At this point, if any of you can think of useful applications for AppSheet in your
organization, please share those with us in the form below. So think about all of
those repetitive tasks that make you crazy day to day, those are the kinds of things
that AppSheets can automate for you.
All right, back to Pablo, let's see if we're okay, still on AppSheet here for just a quick
second. We're going to get back to Pablo’s day to day in his ﬁrst week on the job any
moment here. Let’s see, I'm looking here, you guys have some really interesting --
scrolling through here, Asana, people like the Asana integration. I saw people use
HelloSign. That stuﬀ is all fantastic.
All right, can we -- are we back to Pablo? We're back to Pablo. Back to Pablo, it's the
end of his ﬁrst week on the job. He pulls up calendar in the sidebar while in Gmail,
and he noticed that he should be joining the team meeting, so he clicks to join. On
the call, Allison introduces Pablo to everyone and asked him to share his reﬂections
on his ﬁrst week. And he is really proud of the app that he built in AppSheet,
especially since this is a tool the entire team can adapt.
He shows how easy it is to create requests, assign one to an inspector, follow the
status. He also pulls up the request that he sent to Adu that was already completed.
And if Pablo was joining from a conference room, because hopefully someday he
will, he could use Companion Mode, a feature that's only available in Google Meet
to seamlessly join and share from his laptop while using in-room audio and video.
And with some congratulatory emojis from his colleagues, Allison closes oﬀ the
meeting, and the weekend can begin.
I think it's fair to say that Pablo helped us with quite a lot of demos in his ﬁrst week
on the job. So thank you, Pablo. And I hope that you can see how at every turn,
Google Workspace helps people connect and collaborate to get more done with an
intuitive and integrated set of tools.
With that, I'd like to introduce my colleague, Matt Izatt, who's going to take us under
the hood and talk about how you can build on the Workspace platform.
Thanks, Erika. Hi, everyone. I'm Matthew Izatt and I lead product for the Google
Workspace platform. Under the hood is a powerful engine. Let's talk about how you
can take advantage and build on the Workspace platform. As Javier mentioned,
more than 4.8 billion apps have installed in Workspace to date. This stunning
number illustrates Workspace is more than a hub for work. It's a powerful enabler of
workﬂows.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 47 of 64The opportunity to build on the Workspace platform is massive. Nearly half the
world's population is already using Workspace. That's a huge audience, whether you
want to grow an existing business app or build an entirely new business on the
platform. To help you build experiences to reach these 3 billion users, we've
delivered a range of tools so you can innovate, from no-code options like
AppSheets, as Erika just covered, to powerful scripting with Apps Scripts, to a
complete sets of easy-to-use APIs.
And we’ve been listening to your feedback. Developers want to use their own
preferred language and tools when building integrations like Workspace add-ons or
shout outs, or even using our large collection of REST APIs. So we’ve opened up the
platform to support development with any tools, any language, on any public cloud.
Of course, if you're using Google Cloud, why wouldn’t you take advantage of Cloud
Run, Cloud Data Store, and Cloud AI to power your app? So there’s a big
opportunity to build on the Workspace platform with the tools and languages of
your choice.
Now, let’s take a look at how the process works across the three core stages of our
development; the design, develop, and publish phases of your app.
Starting with the design phase, we’ve created the card builder tool. This tool allows
you to lay out the visual design and user experience of your app. There are range of
templates. And you can also drag and drop components of the app around like a no-
code platform. But for more advance developers, you also have the ability to see the
code in the editor, and make updates there as well.
As we move on to the develop phase, you now have a range of language and
tooling to choose from, whether using options from Google like Apps Script or your
own preferred language and tooling.
While Apps Script is a great option for developers, we have invested in and
extended the Google Workspace platform to embrace a wider range of industry
standard tools. So developers can use their own tech stack and use their existing
code when building for Workspace.
When your integration is complete, congratulations, you're ready to publish it for
public to use in the Workspace Marketplace, where it will be available for billions of
users.
It’s worth nothing that there are more than 5,300 publicly available apps in the
Marketplace today. This number really highlights the diversity of use cases and
remarkable opportunity for developers in building for Workspace.
And of course, if you're developing a custom app for using your own organization,
you have the ability to publish that app privately, so it remains exclusively for the useFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 48 of 64of your organization.
So there you have it, a quick tour of how you design, develop, and publish new
integrations for Workspace.
Now, let’s hear from you. What Workspace platform technologies are you curious to
learn more about throughout the conference? Is it developer tools and languages
like Apps Script or AppSheet? Or maybe it’s product integration through add-ons or
shout outs? Or perhaps data APIs or data access through Workspace APIs?
But that’s enough about the technology platform. Why don’t we take a look at a few
real world examples of integrations developed for Workspace? And let’s start with
the Copper CRM add-on for Gmail.
(Inaudible) identiﬁed a problem. Workspace users needed a simple, but powerful
CRM solution that is built to work with apps in Workspace. So naturally, they build a
solution.
Here, you can see it in action. As a sales rep receives an email from a customer, the
Copper add-on detects the email. After installation, the Copper add-on will detect
the email and pull up the customer information automatically.
With the customer’s information right next to their email, simply we click through the
installation. We eventually get to CMB [ph]. There we are. As you can see, the
Copper add-on has detected the email and pull up the information automatically of
the user. And with the customer’s information right next to their email, the sales rep
has all the insight they need from Copper, and can craft the best response for the
customer, all without leaving Gmail.
Copper is a perfect example of business that has grown alongside Workspace. And
today, 100% -- yes, that’s correct, all of their business comes from Workspace
customers. These are customers who value the best in class CRM solution with deep,
native integration to critical Workspace apps such as Gmail, Drive, and Calendar.
The opportunity to build for the Workspace platform spans multiple surface areas.
So let’s take a look at how this looks in giant [ph] spaces with the brand new Jira bot
from Atlassian.
Here, you can see a customer service rep jumping into the customer success chat
space to report an issue with the customer. After a short discussion in the space, the
rep creates an issue in Jira via the Jira bot. Every time there’s a status update on the
case, the Jira bot will update the team members in the chat. This saves the entire
team valuable time they might have spent going back and forth to Jira and checking
updates. It also helps the team focus on collaborating together to help the customer
instead of navigating their tools.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

All right. Let’s move on to question number two. And this one is going to be for
Erika. And it comes from Michael Etsefron [ph], who asks, is it hard to collaborate if
members are using diﬀerent platforms to join? For example, he’s running oﬀ of
Google’s toolset, but has a partner who’s using a diﬀerent platform?
Yes, this is a really important question, Michael [ph]. Thank you for that. I think the
reality is that we live in a world where there’s diﬀerent sets of products that you or
your partners, or your customers are going to be using. And it’s fundamental to our
way of viewing the world that Workspace should not be a walled garden. It should
integrate. It should connect and make those tasks easier for you.
So on the Drive doc sheet slides side, we invest really deeply in making
interoperability with Microsoft in particular, totally seamless and very easy to use. So
for example, you can open up Microsoft documents in the Google Editor and have
the full interactive experience. Those changes will be saved back to your Microsoft
document including comments. All of those changes are updated in real time.
But there’s also a really important third party compatibility component, which I would
love for my colleague, Matt, to discuss.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

A - Kady DundasYes, it’s fundamental to us that whether using tools which interoperates with the
Workspace Suite, or things will complement the types of functionality that we oﬀer,
that these all work together.
I think one example that we recently announced, our new partnership with Miro,
which is a company that does virtual whiteboarding or collaborative canvassing. And
you can imagine that as you're working with that toolset, not only are you building
things on your virtual canvass, but you're scheduling meetings, you're holding
meetings, with which you want to collaborate in real time while changing things
within that tool.
And so what we are doing is making it really easy for you to schedule a meeting in
Calendar, join a meeting in Meet, and at the same time be working in your Miro
whiteboard. So yes, we believe very strongly that all these things should work better
together; other Workspace and partners that are really great experience for our
customers and users.
That’s great. Thank you. All right, our next question comes from Ben Bing [ph], who’s
with Chandra Ausry [ph] and asks, must we have or use Gmail or company email for
using the rest of Google Cloud and Workspace?
And I think Erika, this is probably one for you.
Sure. Yes, happy to take that.
We have tailored oﬀerings that don’t require you to migrate emails. So Workspace
Essentials is perfect for that. It includes the Workspace product set but without email,
so it integrates easily. And we also have deep interoperability with Outlook and
Calendar.
Got it. Great. Javier, we’re going to move to you next.

And the question comes from Hannah [ph]. And Hannah [ph] says that her team
loves new features, like being able to jump right into a meet from a doc, and is
wondering, will integrations like that be extended to other apps inside Workspace?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

Yes. In fact, we’re very excited to continue to advance the opportunity of bringing --
to start actually from the real time collaborative experience that Google Docs
pioneered, now actually 15 years ago. I think yesterday was our 15th birthday. One
more and we can drive.
And be able to allow users to go from working in real time with others in the
document to easily getting into a live video feed where you can hear and see each
other. And sort of that progression I guess is really important part of ensuring
seamless collaboration, and it applies, we see to both our own editors, as well as
Matt mentioned, third parties over time.
Yes, got it.
{BIO 16235492 <GO>}
Yes.
Makes sense. But we’re going to stay with you, Javier with this next question, which
comes from Carter [ph], who says, my company uses a lot of point solutions like
Zoom and Slack, in addition to having Microsoft and Google licenses. So what would
you say is the argument for consolidating?
{BIO 16235492 <GO>}
Well look, one of the strongest aspects of Google Workspace is the element of
choice, the choice that users make billions of users have made to select individual
products for key roles in their lives, at work, et cetera. And so we’re guided as we
reﬁne these products, by that sense of aﬃnity that people have to the approach that
we bring.
That approach is best expressed and nurtured I think through deeper and better
integration between our products to create something that’s ultimately net new, and
at the same time, we recognize that there are other companies around us and this
vibrant ecosystem of ours that oﬀer diﬀerent points of view, and diﬀerent aspects of
what we also provide. And we believe that there’s ample opportunity for users to
make an informed choice and really recognize -- it comes down to familiarity with the
product, the sense of security that you get from an integrated solution, and
ultimately the cost.
So it’s a choice everyone makes, and over time, we feel really good about the
continued growth of our ecosystem.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

A - Javier SolteroThat’s great. That’s great. Thank you.
Erika, we’re coming back to you with a question from Myles [ph], who asks, how do
you plan to win over diehard fans of Excel and other Microsoft creation tools?
All right, a good challenging questions from Myles [ph].
Well, as Javier said, we introduced Docs and Sheets about 15 years ago. And that
fundamentally re-thought what a ﬁle should be. Our belief is that these experiences
need to leverage the best that the internet has to oﬀer; so, interactivity, connectivity,
and data. And they shouldn’t just be a physical -- a digital representation of a
physical piece of paper that lives on your hard drive. And that’s in stark contrast to
the mental model that legacy solutions have evolved from.
Over the years, we’ve invested a ton in user experience and making this incredibly
easy to adopt. And the great thing is that all of this ease of use which billions of
people take advantage of is [ph] has Google Security in meshed and underpinning
the whole experience.
I would call a couple of features that I hope people are aware of. But if they're not,
they should be. So connected sheets for example, if you weren’t aware, allows Sheet
users to analyze billions of rows of data. Yes, billions, in a single sheet. So that really
pushes the envelope for what a productivity tool can do.
And our innovation around smart canvass, which really supercharges interactivity,
intelligence, and connection to rich data in the form of these modular building
blocks that transcend the ﬁle boundaries. So we bring in smart chips that bring rich
information about people, events, ﬁles, templates, we have tables, and task list. All of
that really further enhances what these ﬁles should be.
So what I would say is for any of the Microsoft, diehard Microsoft fans, we would love
to give you a tour, and I bet we could change your mind.
Got it. Great, thanks, Erika.
All right Javier, we’re coming to you next with a question from Juliet [ph], who
comments that there have been a lot of security breaches lately in the news. And
what are we doing from a Workspace perspective to protect customers from these
sorts of attacks?
{BIO 16235492 <GO>}
Well, it’s a great question. And thank you for the question.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 55 of 64A - Kady Dundas
A - Javier Soltero
A - Kady Dundas
A - Javier SolteroA lot of these attacks originate from the architecture and habits that went along with
legacy products, right; the sharing models, the approach for storing content, the
reliance on heavy, powerful clients that store a lot of information locally on them but
don’t necessarily provide the best degree of security.
Google Workspace was born on a diﬀerent era and has -- it had since the very
beginning a diﬀerent point of view about the design and the approach to security.
And it comes, I guess, as part of us being cloud only, right? Like, we grew up and
we’re architected for the distributed world in which we live in now. And it is the
reason behind why our products are so eﬀective.
So we’ve continued to invest around that to make it even clearer how along with
enhancements and innovative capabilities from Google Cloud security, like the
encore, et cetera, we establish a completely diﬀerent model for securing content
while ensuring the absolute best and most eﬀective level of collaboration within a
company, and beyond a company; so externally with other third parties, et cetera,
and partners.
Absolutely. So it’s really architected to be safe in this world.
{BIO 16235492 <GO>}
Yes, yes. And actually, look, we mentioned this idea of habits, right? Like, these -- the
notion of attachments, right, the model that people grew up with when productivity
tools, digital productivity tools were ﬁrst introduced. Is the main vector through
which a lot of these ransomware and other terrible things tend to start, right?
Somebody, either opens an email, like a phishing attempt, or a malicious attachment,
something that gets spread through various diﬀerent tools that people are used to
using.
And companies are really desperate, say, how do we actually put a stop to this? And
by the way, can we do that in a way that actually works us towards a sense of
transformation in our company? So it’s not just about securing your communication
and collaboration, but ultimately taking that full opportunity to make it more eﬀective
at the same time. So it’s pretty exciting.
That is exciting.
And you have been working in this space for so long. You mentioned the legacy
tools. And from Acompli, to work at diﬀerent companies, you’ve been so focused on
the productivity market. What have you learned across those diﬀerent experiences
and diﬀerent products that is most important and the knowledge that you use today?

Page 56 of 64A - Kady Dundas
A - Matthew IzattWell, listen, I think the most honest answer to that question, and it may surprise some
of you, is you can't please everybody, right? You're building products that play these
very crucial roles in people’s personal lives, and at school, and at work. And part of
their power is that they are horizontal in nature. They allow people their canvasses
for creation, articulation of ideas, et cetera.
And so you have to be very careful and deliberate about the process you use to
evolve those products. And so as I mentioned earlier, we began our journey as
Google in the collaboration space in a very particular point in time where it allowed
us to have a diﬀerent point of view, a more modern approach, and an eye towards
simplicity that didn’t undermine the sophistication and power of the products that
we were doing. That’s what we are really strongest at.
And so as a result, the task of evolving those opinions in products like Docs or
Sheets, or Gmail, or Meet, any one of these products, they are the representation of
a point of view that Google is bringing, that customers are actually informing and
helping us reﬁne over time. But it ultimately requires that we really understand what
it is that we believe the right result is for our customers. And that may mean in some
cases that these products are uniquely powerful for key scenarios, and are not
necessarily just like something that can be used for -- they're not multi-tools, right?
So it’s a really exciting and challenging journey for us.
Absolutely. And having that strong point of view, it’s a great opportunity to get
feedback from all the customers who are listening now. Please share your feedback
in the chat. We want to hear from you.
All right, we have another question. It’s coming in from John [ph], and it’s going to
be for Matt. And John [ph] asks, what are you doing to encourage developers and
ISVs to build for Workspace?
Yes, thanks for asking the question. I know we talked a lot about customers and
users. But at the heart of the successful platform is developers. And so what makes
the developer want to build on the platform?
Let’s start with our open philosophy. Google as a company for a long time has
believed in the openness of data, the openness of access to platform, and that
extends to Workspace. We built an extensive set of APIs and frameworks, and they're
completely open. You can go build something today right now.
Secondly is reach. If you are building something on a platform, you want an
audience, right? You want to build a business on a platform, you want to have
success, your customers have success. And we have -- or Workspace certainly has a
lot of reach. We’re talking about 3 billion users and millions of paying businesses
and paying customers. This is fundamental for why you want to be on the Workspace
platform.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

a lot of eﬀort into making sure they are easy to use and easy to build on. I say easy
from a developer point of view. It shouldn’t take you months and months of trying to
deduce how something works from coding [ph] and documentation, rather it should
be something that you could build up a prototype in an afternoon. And we believe
we have made it that way for you.
And ﬁnally, you’ve seen a lot of logos on our slides today, at our discussion point
today. These are really proof points; Atlassian, Miro, DocuSign -- of the success our
partners are having, and in fact that we believe in being better together.
Absolutely. Thanks, Matt.
Okay, Javier, we’re coming back to you with a question from Laura [ph].
{BIO 16235492 <GO>}
Hello Laura [ph].
Yes. Laura [ph] is asking with COVID still keeping a lot of companies remote, what is
Google and Google Workspace team doing to oﬀset the diﬃculties of distributed
work?
{BIO 16235492 <GO>}
A lot, is the honest, simplest answer. Now look, I think there is a -- it’s a two-part
answer. From one side, as an organization, we have to listen to people. We have to
get feedback from employees. We’ve learned a lot from each other and about the
diﬀerent situations that our employees have to face on a daily basis.
It’s informed our point of view, as I mentioned earlier this idea of having an opinion.
We know that just because work doesn’t take place in a speciﬁc named location any
more, that there aren't like a whole host of new problems and opportunities that you
have to address. Not just with products by the way, but also with policies that a
company adopts, like recovery days, and home oﬃce type end, et cetera.
Now from a product perspective, we have this incredible opportunity to channel
those learnings, along with the input that we get from our customers from around
the world, and even our users to say how are we helping and how can we be more
helpful, I guess, in such a broad uniform sense of the word, by helping people not
just use these products, but be successful with them.
And again, this involves a whole lot of listening, which is why I'm great to have -- it’s
the dynamic experience here with Cloud Next, and also all these great conversations
with users and customers that we’ve been having every -- so, it’s a never-ending task.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12

Hello everyone. My name is Melonie Parker and I am Google’s Chief Diversity Oﬃcer.
I’d also like to introduce Malaney [ph] who’s with us today. She’s going to be
providing ASL interpretation.
Is it great to be back for my third Google Cloud Next. This time, we’re going to look
at nurturing and developing pathways to careers in tech. Today, I’d like to talk about
how building a more diverse inclusive culture is not just a competitive advantage for
us at Google, but it’s a responsibility as well.
And as we get started, I want to let you know that the chat is open so you can
engage with each other during this session. I want you to share your thoughts, shareFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 59 of 64where you're tuning in from, and we’ll have a few of our folks on hand to join the
conversation.
We’ll also get into what we’re doing to widen pathways to tech careers at Google
and across our industry. But ﬁrst, I am so proud to say that Google is committed to
making diversity, equity, and inclusion a part of everything we do, from how we build
our products, to how we build our workforce.
I work hand in hand with our CEO, Sundar Pichai, and as part of our executive
leadership team, to bring our global DEI strategy to life.
I also lead a passionate group of people whose work touches over 140,000
employees, stretches across nearly 60 countries, and helps millions of users who use
our products and our platforms to run their households, their businesses, and their
lives.
And personally, I travel down a very unlikely path to land this position. I'm a black
woman who grew up in a small town in North Carolina. My brother and I are proud
alumni of HBCUs. And we were the ﬁrst generation in our family to bring home a
college degree, which I earned at Historically Black University, Hampton University.
And unlike many of my peers, I didn’t have anyone at home to explain the unwritten
rules of corporate America or to help me navigate my career. Instead, I cobbled
together a community of mentors, managers, and inspirational voices who helped
me ﬁnd my path.
And that’s an idea that I want to focus on today. Access, opportunity, and networking
are critically important building blocks for a successful tech career. And that’s
especially true for folks like me who come from non-traditional backgrounds.
Too many people from underrepresented communities ﬁnd themselves confronting
systemic inequalities, such as a lack of access to STEM education, or access to high
speed internet that disrupt the pathway to tech careers. And for many who do
navigate the pathway, we’ve seen how the wake of inequality can foster a sense of
imposter syndrome once on the inside. It’s that sinking feeling of doubt in our
abilities and a feeling like a fraud, or that we don’t belong, and that for some, it will
linger for an entire career.
Overcoming inequality and creating access to opportunity, including for our
underrepresented talent, this is a top priority at Google. And we’re taking decisive
actions that create opportunities and steadily grow a workforce that reﬂects the
world around us, to launch programs that support our communities globally, and to
build products that better serve all of our users.
In other words, to build for everyone. We need to weave diverse perspectives in to
every step of our design, engineering, and testing processes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 60 of 64And innovative ideas can come from everyone; from Googlers at the grassroots
level, to engaged leaders, and to established diversity councils across the company.
As an example, the Google Meet team worked on a light enhancement feature to
better represent all skin tones in an inclusive way during our video calls. And
through feedback from a diverse group of testers, the team was able to determine
the right algorithm that better work for all individuals across the skin tone spectrum.
And this ensured that all video calls on Meet work well for everyone. And it was
thanks to the collaborative work and questioning how do make products equitable
for all.
And another example, Google has internal teams to foster equity through
technology, empowering our black plus community to innovate in the digital space
by supporting their educational journey, and helping them land roles in the tech
industry.
And we’ve also built external programs like Cloud Career Jumpstart. It’s a 12-week
learning course for underrepresented students with Computer Science, or
Information Systems related majors, or the relevant experience that oﬀers free access
to Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer Training to prepare for the certiﬁcation
exam.
We just published our diversity annual report. And I am excited to share that 2020
was our best year yet for hiring our black plus and Latinx plus Googlers in the U.S. It
was also our best year ever for hiring women in tech in the U.S. and globally.
In addition to hiring, we’re also redoubling the focus on retaining Googlers from all
underrepresented groups. And then full transparency, this is an area where we can
and we must do better. Google depends on the best, brightest, and most diverse
talent to not only help us solve today’s challenges, but also to co-create solutions to
tomorrow’s problems. So we are building a lasting model of inclusion and belonging
that helps all employees feel seen, connected, supported, and I hope proud to be in
service.
Belonging is key to re-recruiting our workforce and acknowledging that not
everyone experiences our culture the same way. Despite our best eﬀorts, some team
members are still feeling left out. There is work to do around building the culture
that we’ve all been working so hard to co-create. Clearly, there’s some other missing
element. And as diﬀerent as we are, we all have the same underlying need to feel
value, to feel like our contributions matter, to feel like we belong here.
But being included isn't necessarily feeling like you belong. Being invited to the
table is not the same as being welcome at the table and being valued like you
belong.
Personally, I’ve been inspired by the work of John Powell. John is an expert in the
areas of civil rights and civil liberties. And he’s a professor at Berkeley and he leadsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 61 of 64the Institute of Othering and Belonging. And he looks at our primal need as team is
to belong, and what fosters belonging and what prevents it.
And if you think about it, one of our primal fears is to be ostracized by a group.
Aside from food and shelter, we need to belong. And we’ve evolved to ensure that
we could maintain access to the resources that the group has. Many behaviors are
dictated by this need to be accepted by others.
But we’re also guided by the fear of losing that very acceptance. And we’ve evolved
to protect ourselves and our loved ones by determining who’s in and who’s out. And
that comes down to identifying who’s the least risk, those that we perceive most like
us and relegating those who aren't to the out crowd.
And John calls that primal sorting of people into ins and outs; the cool kids versus
the non-cool kids, as othering. And we don’t necessarily do this consciously. But it is
the behavior that stems from our unconscious bias, the subtle ways that we send
messages, even virtually, of who’s cool, and who’s not, who’s valued, who’s not. And
that’s why I believe that our work, it’s not truly possible until we foster this sense of
belonging.
And as evolved humans, we have control over this. There are ways to check in with
ourselves, noticing are we turning inward, focusing on only who and what we know,
versus turning outward to connect with and explicitly work with other groups, and to
seek ways to build common ground. And that would foster belonging and empathy.
And this means that we need to co-create the workplace experience with our
internal communities, and redeﬁne what it means to be a Googler, by
acknowledging where we can do better, and by ensuring everyone feels like they
belong, is positioned to do their best work, and can conﬁdently bring their authentic
whole selves to work each day. And for underrepresented talent, this can make the
diﬀerence between surviving and thriving in their career.
And for those of us who are accustomed to muting parts of who we are, authenticity
empowers us to do our very best work.
Last summer, at the start of the global racial justice movement, I realized that I could
no longer cope switch, or check parts of myself at the door in an act of self-
preservation to lead our deep work in racial equity, and address the systemic and
structural barriers. I needed to reconcile the most vulnerable parts of my own
identity as a black woman with the black woman who happens to lead diversity at
Google.
And I know that this is the type of workplace environment that we strive to build. And
with our collective, consistent eﬀorts, that is what we’ll do. We know that Google is
most helpful when our products and our services reﬂect the needs of the people
who are using them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 62 of 64To best serve our diverse global community of users, we need a more representative
workforce. And while we’re making progress, we know equalities persist around
access, opportunity, and networking for underrepresented talent. But through
investments in creating pathways to STEM and with help from allies, we can broaden
the talent pipeline, improve product design, and fulﬁll our mission of making DEI
part of everything that we do.
What’s this look like? There’s a real cognitive shift happening both inside and outside
of Google around diversity, equity, and inclusion, and how we can best build for
everyone. Externally, we’re creating pathways to careers in tech as early as
elementary and high school. We’re expanding recruitment beyond the usual
campuses like Stanford, Berkeley, Harvard, Yale, and doubling down on higher
education institutions like Hispanic serving institutions, and Historically Black
colleges and universities, serving underrepresented talent.
Why? Because we know that 25% of black graduates with STEM degrees for
example, they come from HBCUs, just like the one I attended. So this year, we began
deepening and sustaining at relationships with HBCUs.
In June, we announced a historic, unrestricted $50 million grant that allows the
presidents of these esteemed institutions to allocate resources in a manner that they
see ﬁt.
We’re also broadening career pathways to include a major growth with Google
career readiness investment that supports our Hispanic-serving institutions around
the U.S., a signiﬁcant economic opportunity grant for workforce development, and
digital skills training to thousands of Hispanics, and a career readiness program for
Native American indigenous serving institutions. And that’s just the slice of the work
that we’re doing externally.
And while I mentioned that 2020 was Google’s biggest years in terms of hiring black
and Latinx talent in the U.S., we know that there’s much more work to do inside of
Google to retain and grow our talent. So broadly speaking, we’ve developed racial
equity education for all Googlers and incorporated it into our new hire orientation.
We’ve doubled the size of our retention and progression team. Now, we’re on a path
to triple this team by 2022. And this enables us to provide one to one support like
coaching, networking, and internal mobility opportunities to help underrepresented
Googlers grow and thrive. And we’ve rolled out an innovative onboarding program
for our new black Googlers so that they feel more supported right from the start.
Our employees want to know that they can grow and thrive with us, and that’s one
reason why we’re working to increase leadership representation among women,
black, and Latinx Googlers.
We’ve introduced pathways to sponsorship, for women in technical leadership roles.
It’s designed to accelerate their careers. We leverage partnerships with more thanFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 63 of 64two dozen community and professional organizations. And these partners oﬀer
professional development, as well as networking opportunities for
underrepresented Googlers.
We also oﬀer skills building initiatives like the Cloud Technical Residency program.
And with great intention, we’ve begun building a culture of belonging for all
Googlers as I’ve described earlier.
We’ve been very open about our successes and our challenges. And I invite you to
explore this further at diversity.google.com.
Now, I know many of you are wondering what can I do? So as you weigh your own
strategies around engagement and retention, consider the role of allies in driving
results. Allies can be leaders, managers, and peers. They support folks in
marginalized groups to which we don’t identify.
Internally, we’ve created a number of pathways for allies that are seeking to support
our underrepresented colleagues. These include an Allyship Pathway, with group
exercises for allies and resources for practicing or encouraging inclusive behaviors.
We also have Google in Residence. Experience Google’s software engineers teach
introductory computer science classes on HBCU campuses.
And we have Faculty in Residence. We have more than 50 faculty members from 30
HBCUs to design project-based industry-informed content, and to implement that
content in their classrooms.
Google has doubled in size in the past few years. We know our DEI commitments
need to keep pace. Operating at this global scale, it heightens our sense of
responsibility around DEI. And to paraphrase my colleague, Amy Jean-Baptiste,
there’s no blueprint to doing this work perfectly.
And while we don’t have all the answers, we’re eager to share what we’ve learned
and also to learn from others. And in the spirit of learning leadership, I hope I’ll be
invited to share more discoveries and progress at Google Cloud Next ’22.
In closing, when our mission is to build for everyone, we have to work with everyone.
So with help from allies and through smart investments and creating pathways to
STEM careers, I am conﬁdent our talent pipeline will ﬂourish. Real, meaningful
change can take years, we know. But there’s no need to wait for change to come.
If you haven’t already, please head over the chat room and join the discussion. There,
you can share some of your successes and your challenges around creating
pathways to tech careers. This kind of dialogue can open minds and truly inspire
change.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-12
