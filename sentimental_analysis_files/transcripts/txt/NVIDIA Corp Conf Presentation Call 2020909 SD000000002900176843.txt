Questions And Answers
{BIO 7312618 <GO>}
Thank you. Colette, I'm going to start with the gaming segment ﬁrst, though it is a bit
smaller than your data center sales at 43% in the July quarter.
That's because we're coming oﬀ a very exciting period, a very exciting launch on
new gaming cards.
So the recent RTX 30 Ampere series launch surprised investors on both performance
uplift of 2x over the Turing and pricing, which is similar to RTX.
Can you talk about why the team is so excited about RTX 30, the new apps like
Reﬂex, Machinima, Broadcast and the upgrade opportunity within your 200 million
installed base of gamers?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes.
So thanks for the question. Thanks for hosting us here at your conference.
We look forward to this every year.
So let's start ﬁrst with late last month from the kitchen of our CEO, we launched our
Ampere architecture for gaming. This is our GeForce RTX 30 series.
So the GeForce RTX 30 series is our biggest ever generational leap that we've
always had in gaming. It's up to 2x the performance of Turing, our last architecture,
and 1.9x power eﬃcient versus our last architecture.
It comes with a complete lineup of both architectural products for gaming, but it also
sets us into the second generation of our NVIDIA RTX. Remember, NVIDIA RTX or ray
tracing was ﬁrst of its kind and setting the stage for the next generation of graphics
of the future that we set out with the overall Turing architecture.
What is also key, which you highlighted, is with the overall 2x increase in the overall
performance, we also have the same overall band of price points with the launch of
our products that we have.
There's also some key features to keep in mind with this.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 18A - Atif MalikWe are on the second generation of the RT cores. This is about 2x the throughput of
the previous generation of ray tracing cores.
We're also on the third generation of our Tensor cores, with 2x the throughput from
the previous generations.
There's also the RTX IO, which is about 100x overall performance increase with the
HDDs and additional storage APIs that we've incorporated. This comes with the
fastest graphics memory, the GDDR6X, so to improve the overall data speeds to
close to one terabyte per system of memory bandwidth.
So there's a lot of great things just overall in the core of what we've provided with
overall GeForce.
But you highlighted a bunch of other things that were very key in terms of our
launch.
Other things that we show are support of both the ecosystem and our work in terms
of the software for the ecosystem, to not only improve the overall development of
games, but also to improve the experience of the gamers as they're overall playing.
One of them was NVIDIA Reﬂex. NVIDIA Reﬂex, as it may sound, is a suite of
technologies that allows you to optimize and measure the system's latency. This is
very key and will be a part of some of our important games that are out there, Apex
Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone and even Fortnite, that reduces the latency by up to
50%.
Omniverse Machinima is also a very key app that is built on the Omniverse 3D
workﬂow collaboration platform. This allows both cinematic production using a path
trace viewer tool and engine design for physical accuracy. A very key thing, as you'll
see, going forward, the importance of the live collaboration inside of games as well
as other workloads.
Additionally, we can talk about what we're seeing in terms of NVIDIA Broadcast.
NVIDIA Broadcast is understanding not only are people wanting to play games
and/or watch games, but there's a very big universe out there that is working on
broadcasting how they are working within the overall game. This is a universal plug-
in that enhances the quality of the microphones and the webcams with RTX
accelerated AI functions.
So a lot of diﬀerent things that we've launched with the overall architecture of
Ampere for gaming, not just focused on the overall cards, but really about the
ecosystem, the overall support through software to enable the best experience.

A - Colette KressGreat. Colette, if I look at the gaming demand so far this year, a little bit above
seasonal due to work or game from home eﬀects.
You guided to a 25% sequential growth for gaming in the October quarter. How do
you feel about the holiday season with the new games and broad ray tracing
oﬀering?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes.
So when you look at our overall guidance that we provided for our Q3, we are
providing guidance that we believe sequentially gaming can grow about 25% from
this last quarter, Q2.
We've been doing quite well over the last several quarters, both inﬂuenced by just
the entertainment area and focus on gaming as COVID-19 has moved people into
their home environment. Home environment for them to not only work, for them to
learn, but also to play.
Where gaming is continuing to rise and likely the new normal of a very important
form of entertainment from the overall home.
Now with the overall launch that we have with our Ampere cards, and we are getting
ready for a very important holiday. The holiday season is important because it's also
a season where we'll see others enter the market with the overall consoles and a
console season for the holiday.
We're expecting a big holiday. A total growth in terms of just the evolution of ray
tracing out there with new games that will probably reach this market at this time.
So we're excited for what the second half has for us, not just inﬂuenced by our new
architecture, but just the season of new games coming to the market for the holiday.
{BIO 7312618 <GO>}
Great. Colette, on the console point, how has your PC gaming business fared during
prior new console cycles?
We saw Nintendo raising its forecast with the supply chain by 20%.
Obviously you're exposed there. And how committed are you to the console
business with Nintendo?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 18A - Atif Malik
A - Colette KressSo let me ﬁrst start with how the market has evolved over generations with the
overall consoles. The ecosystem has also changed there. A key part of the driver of
the gaming market is just the games. Gamers want to play and overall watch games.
But what is key now is the games are now written to be played across as many
platforms as possible.
So the new console ramps that we are expecting raise the bar for overall production
of new games. What is very key is that value of games is being inserted with overall
ray tracing and getting ready for the season in front of us. Most games right now,
therefore, are cross-platform, including many of the most popular franchise. These
new console ramps historically have been actually very good for the overall PC
gaming universe as well.
RTX support by the new console means it will also have this feature, but great ray
tracing content and RTX on NVIDIA is important. The RTX 30 series is a generational
leap from where we were just two years ago.
We're the only architecture in market today supporting ray tracing, and we now have
two years of improving that overall piece.
So we're excited in terms of what that brings together.
You also asked in terms of our NVIDIA work with Nintendo and Nintendo Switch.
We couldn't be more pleased with that partnership, that partnership of a win-win
between both companies and what we have put into the market. They have probably
one of the most successful overall consoles in U.S. overall history.
We're committed to continue to help them as we move forward.
{BIO 7312618 <GO>}
Great. Colette, how does NVIDIA manage the smooth handover to Ampere from
Turing especially given the huge performance to price advantage?
Any color, any comments you can provide on the initial orders for RTX 30 series
cards?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes.
So with the launching of our new gaming architecture, it's always a real fun time.
As you've actually noticed with each architecture that we have launched, we've done
something diﬀerently. The reviews and the commentary on our Ampere architectureFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 18A - Atif Malik
A - Colette Kress
A - Atif Malikgaming cards have been extraordinary, likely the best launch ever.
We do not have any online orders or preorders at this time.
So we'll take this opportunity to update everybody at the end of the quarter.
{BIO 7312618 <GO>}
Great. And just moving on to the gross margin side of the business, you mentioned
feeling good about gaining gross margins and growing them generation to
generation. While the use of Samsung 8-nanometer was pretty much in line with our
expectations for Ampere gaming, with TSMC more on the Ampere data center side,
some investors expected TSMC for both. Is sourcing from dual fabs more of a
function of supply tightness, pricing or geopolitical risk or everything?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes.
So our decision to use more than one fab provider probably occurred many years
ago.
We worked to understand the teams and the processes of both of those fabs, and
two of the best fabs, to understand their overall operations. TSMC and Samsung
have both been great partners in our success today.
Our decision on which fab to use takes into account a complex set of factors, mostly
driven on what is best for the overall architecture or what is best for the overall
market platform we are serving, whether or not that is gaming, whether or not it's
pro viz or whether or not it's overall data center. Samsung's 8 node has been a
special node driven just for overall NVIDIA and really the best overall node that we
felt taking to market with Samsung on our overall gaming architecture.
So we're pleased with both of our providers.
But for this one, we are using Samsung to bring it.
{BIO 7312618 <GO>}
Great.
You have gained share in the gaming market per the latest Mercury report. NVIDIA is
a generation ahead in ray tracing.
One common question I get asked is about growing competition with Big Navi from
AMD and then Intel next year. Any kind of thoughts here?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 18A - Colette Kress
A - Atif Malik{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes.
So let's ﬁrst start with how we had focused on diﬀerentiating ourselves in the market,
starting even with our prior architectures.
We focused on the most innovative platform, but also matched with unparalleled
overall software for the ecosystems and the gamer experience, and that has
absolutely served us well.
So really, we are diﬀerent in terms of how we bring both architectures and our
platform to market.
Prior to RTX 30, our overall Turing GPUs with ray tracing and AI technologies were
the best GPUs on the market and generations ahead of any of the overall
competition's features and/or performance.
We've been now with overall ray tracing in market for two years. Not only does that
mean that our cards have ray tracing, that means that we've been working with the
ecosystem to support overall ray tracing in many of the games that have come out.
We have a whole host of games that have both been announced and/or in market.
Two of the top games that are in market are supported on our overall platform using
overall ray tracing, that being Minecraft and now our overall announcement of
overall Fortnite.
So our overall GPUs not only incorporate the use of ray tracing, but it also
incorporates the use of AI into those GPUs. GPUs that can do DLSS 2.0. It improves
the overall performance of that ray tracing by incorporating overall AI to make it
even better.
So this is one of our largest generational leaps in performance.
We're up 2x of our performance versus Turing, the second generation of the RTX
core, the third generation of the Tensor core.
We feel very good about our competitive position at this time as well as going
forward.
{BIO 7312618 <GO>}
Great. Let's switch gears to the data center business, now 45% or the largest
segment of your company. July quarter was the ﬁrst full quarter of Ampere ramp.
Mellanox was up huge at 30% sequentially, and you expect compute to be the major
driver of growth in the October quarter. Where are you in terms of A100 upgrade
cycle within hyperscale vertical?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 18A - Colette Kress{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes.
So to ground everybody in terms of what we guided for our data center after just a
great overall Q2 being the First Quarter incorporating Mellanox, we couldn't be
more pleased on how that is going.
As we move to Q3, yes, we're expecting our data center to grow in the low to mid-
single digits sequentially.
On a year-over-year basis, that's about 150% growth. Historically, our data center
business stems from both growth in our overall hyperscales, in our enterprises, in our
industries.
So keep in mind, with the overall impact on the global economy, we still expect the
ramp of the overall Ampere family to grow as we move into Q3.
So let's talk about where we are within that overall Ampere architecture. And you are
correct, it is still at the very beginning of its launch.
We began our launch with A100 for the data center focused on the overall
hyperscales.
We focused in terms of the A100, which is actually a full system for them, a full
system for their overall modern data centers as they continue to build piece by piece
rather than a full complete overall compute. This overall system enabled them to
quickly qualify and quickly, as you saw, bring up in terms of cloud instances to
support the enterprises as well.
We were able to see overall Google reach in terms of its cloud instances.
You've also now seen Microsoft Azure also up with its overall cloud instances.
But also during the quarter, we announced our work in terms of the server
manufacturers around the world, now bringing A100 out to the normal server
manufacturers out there.
We're expecting 50 diﬀerent systems to be available between Q3 and Q4, probably
about 20 of those systems available in Q2.
So we're still in the early parts of this upgrade cycle for sure.
We're just in the initial quarters, and this is an overall upgrade that will be with us for
several years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09

Great. Colette, a question I get asked is, the cloud ramps that you're seeing at AWS,
GCP, Azure, are they oﬀsetting the inventory digestion commentary that we hear
from the CPU makers or the storage guys or the GPU model behaves very diﬀerently
versus these other components?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes.
We want to step back here a bit and understand that NVIDIA really is about compute
adoption, but compute adoption towards acceleration.
So it is diﬀerent from the normal of overall compute that we've seen for the decades
of the past, and we're focused on acceleration as we move forward.
We're new into that product cycle as we've discussed with the overall A100 ramp,
and those are very interested in using A100 as we've seen so many changes in the
world of AI and acceleration even since the time that we launched the overall V100,
our prior architecture.
We're seeing in terms of a 3,000x increase in the size of the overall models as well
as the overall complexity of those models. A100 is quite well positioned in that
manner to deal with any type of size model, complexity and really work in terms of
some of the most important workloads in AI that have evolved over the last couple
of years. Those areas in terms of conversational AI, natural language processing and
building some of those recommendator engines which are so key for those that are
online and needing those overall quick responses back.
So we have great visibility into Q3 with our overall hyperscales. What we've seen is
we've seen overall mixed results in terms of the vertical industries just given the
overall uncertainty in the market.
On-premises can be challenging because of the overall COVID, but we are seeing
the industries move towards the cloud.
So we expect a strong Q3 and really focusing on that acceleration, that AI form of
compute more than just overall general purpose compute.
{BIO 7312618 <GO>}
And when do you see the demand stabilizing on the enterprise on-premise vertical,
Colette?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 18A - Atif Malik
A - Colette KressSo what we have right now is, given the ramp of overall A100 and as we discussed,
starting ﬁrst with the overall hyperscales and creating those cloud instances that
many of our enterprises work, that's a good bridge to begin a quick adoption of the
overall enterprises as well as we move forward. Right now and it changes quarter-to-
quarter, what we're seeing is the hyperscales are just over 50% of our overall data
center revenue.
What we're seeing is the vertical industries are just over 40%, and supercomputing
can be less than overall 5%.
So those are important to understand what the mix is and the importance of each of
these.
Some of our vertical industries are doing quite well and growing quite well and
some of them will probably take some time for them to move to the new architecture
given a lot of the challenges that we have with the overall economy.
{BIO 7312618 <GO>}
Okay.
On the Mellanox side, Mellanox exceeding expectations so far, what keeps you
excited?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So we're thrilled that Mellanox is now with us here at NVIDIA. The Mellanox team, I
would look at as a perfect match within NVIDIA to join our strategy and our focus in
terms of the future of the data center.
Our years of partnership, I think is really key in terms of how that allowed our First
Quarter at NVIDIA to work so smoothly.
We are now in the process of beginning our work on the future of the modern data
center rather than just getting to know each other.
So we're oﬀ to a great start.
We couldn't be more pleased in terms of the work that they have here in front of us.
That modern data center is really about accelerated using the GPU-enabled
capabilities, disaggregated using Mellanox-enabled capabilities as well as overall
software-deﬁned to really take all the pieces in terms of the data center and
accelerate each one of them piece by piece and not just a focus on the time that is
overall computing or the GPU is enabling that accelerated computing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09

A - Atif MalikSo we're excited to see all the great things working together with Mellanox, but
you're correct. It's oﬀ to a great start, and we're excited to have them on board.
{BIO 7312618 <GO>}
Okay. Colette, this is a tough one.
But again investors kind of always struggle with how to model the growth of the data
center business. The team had talked about a $50 billion TAM by 2023 at its Investor
Day last year, split into a 40, 40, 20, hyperscale, enterprise and scientiﬁc computing
segments. Jensen has talked about cloud being $100 billion market growing at 40%
compounded growth rate. How do you see the long-term data center market growth
for NVIDIA?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
If we step back and look at where we are in the overall ramp of overall AI across the
world, AI is still nascent, and it's still advancing exponentially each and every month
or essentially each and every year. The model sizes we've talked about, even over
three years, have increased 3,000x on the training side before -- and since we've
launched overall V100. It has allowed us to open up to new markets as we continue
to fuel giant new models that can be trained, focused on natural language
processing, probably one of the most diﬃcult pieces of work to understand voice
and translate that voice and return back in normal conversation.
Additionally, we have proven the ability to use a programmable GPU, its overall
software capabilities to take on a very important market such as inferencing.
Inferencing is a huge market that will take place, not only in the data center, but also
on the edge and also in terms of autonomous types of edge devices as we move
forward.
So we're still in those early stages of that. With the inclusion of Mellanox, we now
have that ability to do more than just accelerating overall compute, but we have an
ability to accelerate almost all of the data center with now a focus of the overall
networking.
We've likely added tens of billions to our TAM with the inclusion of acceleration and
opportunities that we now have with overall Mellanox.
So in the early stages, oﬀ to a great start.
But yes, there is a large TAM and a large opportunity for our data center business as
a whole going forward.
{BIO 7312618 <GO>}
Okay.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 12 of 18A - Colette Kress
A - Atif MalikThis is a tricky one, too. Jensen mentioned on the last earnings call that NVIDIA
works closely with ARM, and he respects the energy eﬃciency of the ARM
architecture. Just conceptually, are there advantages or disadvantages, if any, on
combining a CPU with a GPU in future compute architectures?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So ﬁrst, I'll start oﬀ.
Yes. We work with all CPUs.
We are agnostic to each, any of the overall CPUs that are available. For example,
within our DGXs and our new SuperPODs include the AMD CPU as well.
We also work closely with ARM. With each of the workloads, it is a choice of the best
overall CPU architecture and is considered when we put some of those workloads
together.
Some geographies don't want to be dependent on the x86 overall processors.
So in this case, ARM is the most popular instruction set in the world and essentially
fuels billions of devices that are out there. ARM is also very power eﬃcient and is
considered for something in the data center to improve that overall data center TCO.
ARM is the only CPU right now without accelerated compute support.
So NVIDIA had started that work in terms of working with ARM to bring CUDA to
their instruction set.
We work with a variety of software -- excuse me, a variety of hardware, software
companies in the ARM ecosystem.
We believe that CUDA and GPU acceleration for ARM-based servers, such as
hyperscales, edge computing and HPC applications, can be with us in the overall
future.
So that's how we think about all the diﬀerent future compute architectures, but our
focus is making sure that we are agnostic to all the CPUs that are out there or
essentially any of the players that are in the data center in terms of assuring that
NVIDIA's overall GPU workloads can work eﬀectively and well to accelerate
everything in the data center.
{BIO 7312618 <GO>}
Okay. Then switching to auto. Ampere architecture powers next-generation auto
platform called Orin, delivering more than 6x the performance of Xavier and 4xFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09

A - Atif Malikbetter power eﬃciency. How does the improved power management proﬁle on
Ampere compare with competition?
Will this signiﬁcantly help to close the gap on Level two and up?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes.
So we're very excited in the last six months what we have brought to market for
many of the auto manufacturers, the Tier 1s and many of the overall start-ups.
As you know, we have been focused on an end-to-end platform, enable the cars to
take what they have in terms of production of AV from a Level 2, a Level 2+, all the
way up to a fully autonomous, and also taking care of what we may want to do in
terms of overall robotaxis.
Now an important piece of that is making sure that they have that end-to-end system
that enables the ability to advance to Level 3, Level 4, even with the overall same
hardware. The energy eﬃciency is important. But generally, all of our overall GPUs
and all of our overall platforms continue to be the best in terms of performance and
energy eﬃciency together in terms of what we're bringing into market.
This last quarter was an important quarter of us to announce one of the most
transformational overall deals in the automotive industry.
Our work in terms of with Mercedes is very key and a very important thing that a lot
of eyes are on. What it did was take a company, such as Mercedes, and such a rock-
solid company that's been available for more than 100 years, and working with us to
develop the full software stack that will go into their AV solution. Using our hardware,
that the hardware at the onset can continue to upgrade with software and enable
many diﬀerent levels of overall AV over the life of the ownership of the overall car.
The great piece of that, which is so great for us as well is the ability to share that
revenue with Mellanox, share that software revenue back to overall NVIDIA.
We're not only working inside of the car with our Orin pieces and many other parts
of our overall system, but keep in mind that we are working with Mercedes back in
their data center to both support leading up to overall production as well as the ﬂeet
that will be out there on the road and the data on continuing to work with that data
over the time.
So we're really thoughtful in terms of thinking through a supermodel that can be
leveraged across the overall industry, but our work with Mercedes is deﬁnitely
transformational.

A - Colette KressGreat. Then moving to the ﬁnancial model. Gross margins in second half because of
the gaming mix are coming down. Do you see it trending back up to 66% as data
center mix normalizes, let's say in ﬁrst half of next year?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes.
So in our Q2 results, our Q2 results last quarter, we hit record levels at 66% overall
non-GAAP gross margin. Remember, the mix of our products still remains our largest
driver for our overall gross margins.
Last quarter, with the inclusion of Mellanox, our data center revenue reached record
levels and helped drive our overall gross margin expansion. With our Q3 guidance
for non-GAAP gross margins, they're just slightly below that record level in Q2. New
products that we are introducing have slightly lower margins earlier in the ramp, but
we expect those margins to tend to increase as both yields mature and as we
optimize a lot of those overall component costs.
So when you think about that overall Ampere architecture as a whole, keep in mind,
we have a very strong mix expected of gaming as we move into Q3 from Q2. Within
that gaming mix, we also expect all of our platforms to grow, including our consoles.
Our consoles do not have as high a gross margin as the company average.
So in total, we expect to continue to focus on our overall gross margins and focus in
terms of launching this Ampere architecture across both data center and gaming.
We expect over the long term to have an ability to move them up over time.
{BIO 7312618 <GO>}
Okay.
Then on the OpEx side, hiring and retaining an AI developer, software talent in
Silicon Valley is a tough job because you're competing against Internet and software
companies. How do you incentivize your employees?
And how should we think about the OpEx growth relative to the sales next year?

A - Colette KressWe do have more overall software developers than we actually have hardware
developers. The great thing is our software development is done in many places
around the world and now is actually done at home as we still have almost all of our
sites closed as we are all working from home.
There's no place on the planet that you can go and work like an NVIDIA place.
NVIDIA has the ability to produce software for so many diﬀerent overall workloads
and some of the most important workloads of the future. When we think about
overall ray tracing for gaming, when you think about everything from virtual reality or
augmented reality, enterprise types of graphics, even before we think about the
workloads that we are doing in terms of in the data center and the focus on AI and
autonomous vehicles. There are some great pieces that we can entice a lot of that
talent, but I think what is more important is the talent enjoys NVIDIA.
We have probably one of the best retention that we do in terms of our talent here.
People come to work in NVIDIA and do their life's work, their life's work in terms of
focus on that GPU overall architecture and thinking about the use of acceleration in
so many of these diﬀerent platforms going forward.
So right now, we feel very good in terms of both our ability to retain and attract
talent to overall NVIDIA.
As we turn the corner into next year, as we've just talked about, we've got many very
important workloads, very big markets in front of us that will continue to need our
focus and continue to see our investment.
So we don't necessarily look at OpEx as a percentage of sales.
We look at it that says, where is the best use of overall OpEx to assure that we can
meet these large opportunities in front of us.
So we'll provide more once we turn the corner at the end of this year to focus on
what we see as OpEx going forward into ﬁscal year '22.

Okay. Colette, TSMC is building a fab in U.S. next year.
We hear U.S. semiconductor industry lobbying for $37 billion, with $17 billion in
research and a chip factory. There are geopolitical tensions with China. What does it
all mean for NVIDIA?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So the idea of bringing a high-end fab here into the U.S., we couldn't be more
excited about it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09

A - Colette KressWe work with two of the best overall fab providers on the planet today. Having one
of those closer into the U.S. would be great for us.
We deal right now with a worldwide workforce working with those fabs, but having
something closer to home here in Santa Clara would also be great for us as well to
think about it.
So we couldn't be more supportive of something in that space.
We are working also with the semiconductor industry because I think we need to
work together as a group.
We are just one piece of this, and we do support the needs of that overall
semiconductor industry.
{BIO 7312618 <GO>}
Okay.
We have about three to four minutes left. I'm going to switch to audience questions.
Colette, could you comment further on opportunities for data center for new
verticals?
And in particular, for enterprises, could you make some examples?
What is missing for penetration to increase further adoption in enterprises?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes.
So we've had a great rollout in the last two years focused on building out many of
the workloads for the enterprises. What has enabled us to be quite successful in this
piece is the focus in terms of the software that will need to be available and the
overall production of development resources to enable these workloads as we move
forward.
Now we have focused on very key areas.
One, we focused on manufacturing.
We focused on metropolises and building out the overall smart cities.
You've seen us focus in terms of on Clara.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09

Page 17 of 18So when you think about our data center platforms, it's not just focused on that
hardware.
We have built so much of the software libraries, components, compilers and working
with many of the diﬀerent frameworks that enable it.
We have enabled in terms with our Tensor cores for depending on the workload and
depending on that precision in order to address the overall workloads that are out
there.
Our focus in terms of e-tail and retailers have been very key as well.
You've seen us focus with large lighthouse retail, such as Walmart, focused on very
large distribution, such as the U.S. Postal Service.
So each and every one of these workloads continues to drive overall acceleration
into the enterprises.
We also know the enterprises are focused on cloud computing as well.
So we hit in both areas, both in terms of edge computing that we can provide to
them, but also what we can provide in those cloud instances.
Let's step back and look at what A100 provides. A100 provides a solution for you to
not have to choose or determine at the onset whether or not you need to do training
or whether or not you need a virtual VM, okay?
You can do both.
You can do inferencing and training on the same platform. This is great not only for
the hyperscales as they built out their data centers, but it is also a very useful
technique for the enterprises as they think about the reuse and redistributing that
overall compute for the latest types of workloads that we're doing.
So our work is essentially workload by workload or industry-speciﬁc and really stems
with the application and the software.
One more piece that is important is our work in terms of the data scientists that are
out there or the data analytics. This is a very important piece of almost every
enterprise, and it's not necessarily industry-speciﬁc. The enterprises are out there
spending time working with their data scientists to understand how to leverage their
data to make overall decisions. It's a relatively ineﬃcient process. They spend a lot of
time loading data. They spend a lot of time reanalyzing data, rerunning overall
queries to get the information that they were looking for.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09

A - Colette KressWe have now been able to stitch ourselves together with Spark, Spark 3.0, which is a
very key component in terms of the work that they do. Accelerating that entire
process, from end to end in terms of the data load, the working with the data and
feeding back out that data, can improve something that is integral to all of the
overall enterprises that are out there.
So more to come, but this is what all of our software engineers continue to do every
day is more and more workloads that address the industries and the enterprises
around the world.
{BIO 7312618 <GO>}
Great.
We're almost at the end of time.
Colette, thank you for being part of the Citi conference. Really appreciate it.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you, so much for hosting us.
We'll see you next year as well.
