All right. Good morning, and welcome to J.P. Morgan's 41st Annual Healthcare
Conference here in San Francisco. My name is Harlan Sur. I'm the Semiconductor
Analyst for the ﬁrm. And for the fourth time in ﬁve years, we have the team from
NVIDIA presenting. And in fact, in the 41-year history of the healthcare conference,
NVIDIA has been the only semiconductor company to present here. So very honored
to have them again here this year.
For those of you that don't know NVIDIA, leader in accelerated computing
semiconductor systems, hardware and software platforms, in areas like artiﬁcial
intelligence and deep learning, powering some of the world's most powerful
supercomputers and driving compute innovation for cloud and hyperscalers as well
as large vertical markets like healthcare and life sciences.
Here with us today is Kimberly Powell, Vice President of Healthcare at NVIDIA. She's
responsible for the company's worldwide healthcare business, including hardware
and software platforms for accelerated computing, AI, visualization, the power of the
ecosystems, of imaging, genomics, life sciences, drug discovery and healthcare
analytics. So Kimberly, thank you for joining us today, and let me go ahead and turn
it over to you.
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
Thank you, Harlan. Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. Nice and dry.
So an honor, really, and I thank you, Harlan and J.P. Morgan, for inviting us back. This
is absolutely a diﬀerent kind of feeling year, and I'm excited to really share it with
you.
So let's just do the ﬁrst housekeeping. Let me start with a reminder that the
presentation in QA contains forward-looking statements, and investors areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-12

our risks and uncertainties facing our business.
Super. So you might know NVIDIA as an amazing chip company. And in fact, we are.
But we're much, much more than that. We are an accelerated computing platform
company. Some scientists, some industries actually describe us as a time machine.
We launched our GPUs into general-purpose programmable processors with our
programming model called CUDA. We now have well over 33 million CUDA
developers. And then for the last 15 years, we've been developing a full stack of
computing approach. So the ability to program the chips, but also be able to
introduce acceleration libraries, applications and purpose-built computing
platforms, whether that's large-scale datacenters for artiﬁcial intelligence or
embedded supercomputers for the medical devices industry.
And so for each ﬁeld of science and industry, and applications, we create a full stack,
everything from gaming to design, earth and life sciences and self-driving cars and
robotics. And this allows us to really serve $100 trillion worth of industry. But we're
here to talk about healthcare.
So for healthcare, we created a platform called NVIDIA Clara. It's after Clara Barton.
She was the inventor of the American Red Cross, not after Santa Clara, where our
headquarters is, and it's an AI computing platform for healthcare. We recognize that
healthcare is becoming the absolute largest data-generating industry. And we have
global challenges increasing the cost of healthcare delivery and access to
healthcare.
So we build computing platforms to serve these grand challenges, leveraging world-
class chips and systems. We build platforms that span embedded edge, all the way
through to cloud applications and frameworks that span from healthcare delivery to
disease and drug discovery. And I'll hopefully show you some of that today.
Our computing platform is why we adopted. We're relied on by all of the top
medical imaging companies to turn sensor information into rich images. We're
quickly becoming the de facto standard for surgical robotics platforms, for real-time
sensor processing. We're helping the medical and cancer centers be able to be
really data-driven in their clinical treatment decision-making. And we're increasing
the accuracy and throughput of sequencing so that we can reduce the overall cost of
genomics and hopefully bring it more into the standard of care. And we're turbo
charging the drug discovery process using artiﬁcial intelligence to really illuminate
biological meaning and explore literally the inﬁnite possibilities of small molecules
and antibodies.
So in healthcare delivery, imaging is the essential tool. It's used at every stage of the
patient journey, which is why it was one of the application areas we chose to focus
on when I started at NVIDIA 15 years ago. As sensors evolve, so do the computing
platforms and the applications in the healthcare delivery need to evolve. So from 2DFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 15sensors that allow us to do annual screening into advanced 3D and 4D to do
quantitative image analysis and to capture things like function in the new Photon CT
scanners that have recently been released.
And now we're entering into what I call the ﬁfth dimension where we can, in real
time, with real-time sensing, we can -- these devices can really actually take action.
They can do things like self-navigate. They can do things like adapt while you're in
the middle of a radiation treatment. So very, very exciting times.
And so much like the self-driving car industry, I love to use that parallel because we
can all sort of understand it, the healthcare industry is becoming software deﬁned
and is able to deliver great, great value through software. And in order to do so, you
need two computing platforms. You need an AI development platform and AI
deployment platform. And you need to connect these two so that the data that you
were experiencing on the edge is very dynamic. And it's that data that you can
collect at the edge to bring back in to improve these applications and redeploy
them. This is the as-the-service architecture, and NVIDIA is building this end-to-end
computing platform to serve it.
So here's an example. NVIDIA Clara provides the imaging industry, radiology,
pathology, all the surgical data, the AI development platform, it's called MONAI.
MONAI is an open source AI framework that we codeveloped with the industry, the
academic medical centers and experts. We open source it, and then we have an AI
deployment platform called Holoscan. So using MONAI as the AI framework for
imaging, we've had over 800 million downloads of this framework. It's absolutely
accelerated. And it's a driving force in the exponential growth in the AI research. You
can see that through the publications here.
And then to help close the gap between research and clinical deployment, we
announced last year, NVIDIA Holoscan is meant to be a commercial oﬀ-the-shelf
more general purpose computing platform for these applications to live, so that not
every medical device needs to reinvent their computing platform every time a new
sensor technology comes to market.
So a scalable real-time AI sensing platform and it can scale, as I said, from
embedded to cloud. We have developer kits already out there in market, and we
announced design wins with several robotic surgery companies already.
The innovators in the industry are using NVIDIA platform to deliver new applications
across radiology into therapy. So as you can see, just as we described, Carestream
uses artiﬁcial intelligence to really have a complete smart AI X-ray room. It's at the
room level all the way down to the device level to streamline workﬂows. You have
Varian and Elekta where they can now use AI to do adaptive therapy, real-time
adaptive therapy for their patients. I love the intuitive ion because it allows you to
navigate into the lung and biopsy areas, otherwise no humans could travel. So these
devices are absolutely opening up tremendous new capabilities, and we're excited
to see the medical device market continue to go through this revolution.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-12

Page 4 of 15But I want to go quickly next to a modality that is just super, super exciting. And I
think we all saw a 2022 that changed the landscape of genomics tremendously. So
genomics is a modality that is delivering great value to healthcare as well as research
and drug discovery. It is the largest data generator in healthcare and growing
rapidly.
We're witnessing the continued decline in cost, enabling large-scale genomics
programs to transpire. However, we need to be sensitive to the fact that a lot of
times, when you advertise the cost of sequencing, it's just the cost of sequencing
and not the downstream analysis, which is ultimately the insights that we need to
care for our patients and to deliver insights into discovery.
And so this is why we are partnering across the genomics industry from new
sequencers to bio informatics platforms to cloud services and large pharma. So 2022
was an absolute breakout year for NVIDIA accelerated genomics. We partnered with
Oxford Nanopore and Stanford and many others to achieve a Guinness record in
clinical sequencing. We made NVIDIA Clara Parabricks free for research and
partnered with the Broad Institute and put it in the Terra platform, so it's -- and it's
also available in every public cloud.
And just this week, our partners at BioNeMo announced our work in accelerating 96
optical genome mapping workﬂows for high-throughput on-prem and cloud
deployments, where they're having tremendous outcomes helping patients with this
new structural variant capabilities.
So AI is becoming vital to all areas of genomics analysis, in fact. Primary analysis,
which takes the signal or image and turns it into the genomic base calls, is all done
now through artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms because it helped realize a step
function and accuracy as well as performance. And the higher the throughput of the
instrument, the lower the cost of sequencing. So AI is also bringing that speed.
And so just a few months ago, Seattle Children's and the University of Washington
were able to deliver a genetic risk assessment within three hours of a newborn's life
to rule out that a disease that their sibling had. By reducing the cost, increasing the
speed and partnering with the clinical community, we can bring the condition to
move sequencing more into the standard of care, and we're really excited to do that
across the board with all of our sequencing partners.
With more sequencing platforms and modalities entering the market, we are going
to be pushing these 40 exabytes of genomic data out there into the world. And we
already have 500,000 genomes into 1 million genome databases associated with
patient data. And these are becoming readily available. And so we must harness the
latest breakthroughs in artiﬁcial intelligence to drive our biological understanding
and therapeutic discovery.
So we had some incredibly exciting breakthroughs at the end of last year at the
Supercomputing Conference. It's a super neat example of how you can harnessFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 15large genomic data to drive genomic understanding. And we worked with NVIDIA
Argonne National Labs, University of Chicago and achieved this just last -- late last
year and won the Gordon Bell Supercomputing Award.
So you know the latest technology that is taking the world by storm is generative AI
in large language models, most notably, ChatGPT. These models are trained on
extremely large unlabeled data sets, and they can learn context and meaning by
tracking relationships and sequential data. Sounds very much like genomics, if you
ask me.
And so the same can be used on genomic sequencing data, and we did just that, co-
developed a model called Genes LM [ph]. And it's the ﬁrst genomic scale and the
largest biological language model to date. So used 110 million bacteria sequences
from the Patrick database. And then we ﬁne-tuned it with 1.5 million SARS-CoV-2
genomes. And the model was able to not only predict the evolution of the virus, so
potentially be useful for an early warning system, but it was also able to accurately
identify variance of concern. And this is all published, and the paper is in the source
there. So really, really super, super amazing breakthrough here.
And I want to kind of give you a sense to what are these models learning? And how
are we going to be able to really understand how they learn and represent
biologically relevant information? So let me just kind of play this video that the team
made this to sort of give you a description of what's going on.
You can see through clustering that the model is ﬁnding semantic meaning in the
latent space. And ﬁrst, you can see it cluster genomes by their sequence lengths,
and then we're going to move into here. You can see it with this GC content
indicating secondary structure stability. And then we could even zoom in on
particular enzymes, and we can see the structural diﬀerences. And this is something
actually the model was never trained for.
And so these models are actually helping us with interpretability. No longer are the
days of deep learning black boxes. These foundation models are -- give us a new
ability and become the bedrock for us to really be able to read and start to
understand biological meaning. So very, very exciting opportunities here. And this is
-- language models applied to genomics. We are just getting started.
So like generative AI has set oﬀ broad use across all industries, AlphaFold set the
image at moment for AM Biology. And standing on the shoulders of giants and the
breakthrough is coming from deep mine and open AI, biology labs at Meta, Roast
Lab, Baker Lab, Barsele Lab [ph] and thousands more published papers in 2022. So
generative AIM biology is witnessing that same broad applicability across life
sciences and drug discovery.
Like I said, from pandemic early warning systems to target discovery, to protein
structure prediction, to virtual screening, to drug target interactions and protein
engineering, literally touching every phase of the drug discovery process. And soFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 15biology is going from an empirical science, experimentation and exploring the
physical natural world to computer science and AI, and we're -- it's quickly moving
from a science to an engineering.
So just this morning, we're announcing exciting results of a collaboration between
NVIDIA, InstaDeep, who -- congratulations, who just announced they were being
acquired by BioNTech and Technical University Munich. And it's resulted in a state-
of-the-art genomics language model. Genomic language models are still in early
investigation, DMA Bart being one of the early notable ones. But you can imagine
that much of this technology has been applied to natural language processing, but
the genome has four letters in 3 billion -- of 3 billion long sequence. So it presents
new challenges.
And so we use the NVIDIA Cambridge-1 supercomputer. We trained a collection of
large language genomic models. And the highest performing model called
nucleotide transformer. It achieves state-of-the-art on not only one of the
benchmarks, but on 15 out of 18. And that means that this large foundation model is
able to generalize across many, many tasks, which otherwise were built model at a
time quite narrowly.
The paper is really, really informative, and it shows you that multi-species data was
super important to be good at generalizing across these tasks. It was also very
important in showing that you need larger and larger language model sizes. And
that's why NVIDIA is here, so we can enable that to happen.
So the highest performing model ranged from 500 million parameters to 2.5 billion,
and the 2.5 billion parameter model absolutely went out. So this will be published in
a paper in the coming hours as archived chunks through it, and then we will also
make a fraction of these models readily available in the coming weeks.
This is exactly why we created NVIDIA BioNeMo service, announced in September
last year at our GPU Technology Conference, to enable the over $200 billion of R&D
market and drug discovery. How can we give them access to the tools, the
frameworks, the applications at data center scale to accelerate drug discovery?
So BioNeMo is making it easier and more eﬃcient to build and use generative AI in
large language models across every stage of that drug discovery process I just
enumerated. BioNeMo is in early access, and we're working across the entire
ecosystem with the leaders in biology and drug discovery ﬁeld from research to the
tech bios, all the way through to the large pharmaceutical companies.
Today, we are also announcing with our partner, Evozyme, that we've built a
generative AI model for protein engineering called ProT-VAE. It's a protein
transformer variational auto and coder. As you know, proteins are the building
blocks of life. Every cell contains proteins. They're present in our everyday life from
clothes we wear, food we eat, air we breathe. So the ﬁeld of protein engineering
looks to discover new proteins that can help design more eﬀective drugs andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 15remove carbon from the air or make more environmentally friendly clothes. However,
the number of potential proteins far exceeds the number of particles in the universe.
So Evozyme was able to use in a few short weeks, be able to use NVIDIA BioNeMo,
use our pre-trained models, inject their special sauce with the VAE encoder and train
a model and be able to, from sequence, generate proteins that they were able to
experimentally synthesize and validate in the lab. The beauty about this is they use
BioNeMo to ﬁne-tune that model for family of proteins. So you can ﬁne-tune it for a
set of proteins that has the given properties function and characteristics that you
want, and then it can generate a library of those.
And so I want to, again, give you a little ﬂavor for what that looks like. So the -- here's
an example of a protein called human PAH. It's a protein responsible for a precursor
to making pigments, hormones, also neurotransmitters, and it can even cause some
pretty rare disease disorders. So the ProT-VAE model, it was trained on PAH protein
family. And here, we sampled two of the proteins generated and validated.
The ﬁrst protein generated had 51 mutations, which is about 85% similarity to the
original, and it has a 2.5x, a huge 2.5x enhancement in function. This is what exactly
you want when you're developing new therapies.
ProT-VAE also generated another protein with 167 mutations, so only 50% similar.
This is where no human would intellectually go, but it was able to still achieve
enhanced function. And so the protein language of ProT-VAE, it generated proteins
nature's never seen before, but it was able to maintain the function for the desired
properties that they were measuring for. So this is the promise of these large
language models, the ability to explore way outside the space. And so we're going
to extend what is today the common use of directed evolution and extend it into
machine-guided directed evolution. And it's really an accelerator to be able to
discover new proteins.
And so I'll conclude with NVIDIA is building the compute platforms to address the
breadth of healthcare to beneﬁt from extraordinary capabilities enabled by
generative AI and accelerated computing. MONAI for imaging, Parabricks for
genomics, BioNeMo for drug discovery are helping the industry harness the
computation and massive accelerate R&D and the workﬂows that drive healthcare
and life sciences.
And so the time for generative AI and biology is now. An explosion of seminal work
happened in just the last three months of last year. I've exempliﬁed them here with
these models, and they are elucidating biological meeting. This is going to help us
understand disease, and it will accelerate our ability to discover new therapies. And
so we can build representations of large and complex data sets now and make
meaningful predictions.
So with that, I hope I leave you with a very bright and sunny future of what 2023
holds to really harness this technology, and I look forward to answering yourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-12

Questions And Answers
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
(Question And Answer)
Great presentation. Are there any questions out there? I'll just ask, did you wait for
the mic? Got one back there.
NVIDIA's revenues seem to have peaked in April of last year and have declined --
quarterly declined since. Can you explain that? And why you think it's temporary?
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
I cannot. I am not in our Investor Relations team, so I will politely decline that answer.
Thanks.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Questions? I've got one right over here in the middle.
Yes. Can you just talk about the competitive landscape, your customers? What other
alternatives they have? How much has done internally? How much they need to go
outside for AI solutions?
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
Yes. I think the competitive landscape in artiﬁcial intelligence is we are in a unique
position at NVIDIA. We're the only AI company that can also work with every other AI
company. Our platform is well adopted in every single public cloud. It's adopted by
every single computer maker on the planet, and it ranges in sizes from embedded
computers, all the way through to cloud platforms.
And so if you look at that sort of future description of what we can oﬀer the market,
it's a ubiquitous computing platform. And so it allows us to give the application
developers, the industries the ability to transform business models and run these
exciting new application workloads completely at scale.
And as you know, we dedicated the company to artiﬁcial intelligence going back
some 10 years ago -- yes, at least 10 years ago. And the description language IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 15Q - Harlan Sur
A - Kimberly Powell
Q - Harlan Surdescribed called CUDA has been around even longer, 15 years. And so the ability to
reinvent sort of that software ecosystem is very, very tricky.
And that's why I really describe NVIDIA not as a chip company, but we are an
accelerated data center company. And so to compete at that level is very, very
diﬃcult. And the software investment that we've made and our ecosystem partners
have made is really what diﬀerentiates us and allows us to remain -- allows us to
innovate continuously at the speed of light, because we're a full stack company.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Questions? I've got a question. So -- and maybe this will answer the gentleman's ﬁrst
question. Obviously, the consumer part of your business was weaker last year
because of the weaker macroeconomic trends, some of the lockdowns in China. The
data center business, which is where your franchise belongs, that's -- I think that grew
40%, 50% last year, and it's still on. It's still going at a very strong sort of double
digits year-over-year clip.
In fact, the data center business for NVIDIA has grown at a 70% CAGR over the past
three years. It's 60% of your total revenues. Underneath that, accelerated compute
spending within healthcare continues to grow at an extremely rapid rate as you sort
of reﬂected in your presentation. Can you just give us a sense, snapshot of the
revenue scale, the growth rate for your healthcare franchise over the past few years?
And how do you see the SAM opportunity for healthcare over the next three to ﬁve
years?
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean healthcare is an extremely important industry, and it's quite broad. And
I hope I was able to let you know that we're focused on some very important large
markets within it, whether that be genomics, medical devices, the biopharma
industry. So we believe that we could be the next $1 billion industry for NVIDIA.
And you can -- as I described, there's these two computing platforms that are
needed for the future of how we're going to innovate, develop software and as a
service. And so one proxy you could use, Harlan, is look at the growth in AI research
papers. It's all being done on that development platform. So in the last two years,
120% growth, and then we're addressing the ability to deploy these applications.
They're maturing now. They're running in the data center.
But now they also want to run at the edge because there's a lot of incredible value
you can provide the industry when you're developing real-time insights at the edge
and then also have a ﬂexible computing platform to continue that analysis and
development back in the data center in the cloud. So that's kind of the proxy that we
use, and I think 120% growth sounds great.

Yes, absolutely. Questions?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-12

Page 10 of 15Q - Analyst
A - Kimberly Powell
Q - Analyst
A - Kimberly PowellHi. Yeah. As a follow-up -- sorry, I lost my voice. As a follow-on from that perspective
around this potentially becoming $1 billion industry for the data center sort of value
proposition that NVIDIA can underpin, which of the traditional healthcare
stakeholders need to enable or buy into the value chain of your end customers? So
do you need reimbursement or regulatory or sort of government buy-in to the
innovative products that get built on the stack for you to realize the $1 billion at your
end?
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
Yeah. I think -- I don't know if that's going to be our rate limiter at the moment. I think
as I sort of alluded to, these large language models that we just described that were
built in just the last three months of last year, they take an entire supercomputer to
train them. So just to be able to explore this new capability in generative AI and
large language models is a data center in itself for said customers.
So the pharmaceutical industry, you can hear it all over the ﬂoor here at J.P. Morgan,
they're building centers of excellence in AI. They're using all of the massive data sets
that they've acquired over the last decades of drug development. There was $40
billion of investment that was pumped into what the term I love, which is tech bios,
technology-ﬁrst biology companies, because they're -- we're able now to generate
so much biological data to really drive this model development.
So I think purely from that realm, we can reach that potential $1 billion opportunity
amongst many of the other opportunities, but the analysis of genomics. But
generative AI and large language models is just a clear easy one to understand.
How much of your healthcare business today comes from genomics versus radiology
and robotic surgery and more conventional healthcare segments?
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
I don't think we -- I don't know if I would be that granular about it. It used to be, call
it, sort of like an 80/20 split where we would be so in the medical devices. I kind of
grew what you described would be very medical device centric. That's where we
started. That's where our heritage lies, going inside of CT scanners, inside the
genomic sequencing instruments, powering the robotic surgery platform.
So all of that was kind of, call it, 80% and 20% was kind of coming from simulation
that's going on in the pharmaceutical industry, the genomic analysis. And we're
deﬁnitely now coming into more of a 50/50, because of some of the dynamics that I
just described of massive amount of computing that is being -- that is happening in
pharmaceuticals. So the balance is there, but they're both growing at the sort of
indicated pace of what you're seeing in the AI research.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-12

Questions?
Thank you for a great presentation, a huge fan of NVIDIA.
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
Thanks.
And we buy a lot of your stuﬀ as an AI start-up. But I see that recently, the bio -- tech
bio market has kind of declined. So some companies have, of course, grown
dramatically, hopefully like us, but some have declined. So how do you see the split
now between big pharma and tech bio going forward in terms of the GPU sales and
also cloud sales? And because many pharmaceutical companies are still kind of in a
little bit of an Intel world, but now, of course, everybody is switching to NVIDIA, but
how do you see that split?
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
Yeah. I don't want to predict the market, Alex. We're kind of -- as a platform
company, we love to raise all boats and support the ecosystem the best way that we
can. You're a fantastic partner at -- and Silico paved the way in showing that
generative AI can be used across the complete drug discovery process coming to
GTC for the last 10 years.
So one, you have to be a believer. I think pharma is still trying to ﬁgure out, are we a
believer in this technology? So they're doing a lot of dipping into it. And they're also
kind of waiting and watching and partnering with the tech bio company.
So I don't want to make a prediction. I think the industry and the number of
therapies and the personalization of medicine, there's room for everybody if they
were up to me. But I don't -- I think that there's a tremendous amount of promise. I
think there is a need to think diﬀerently in this day and age with the tools that weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-12

{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
Yeah. Thank you, yes. ChatGPT is just -- it's an amazing technology, and it's -- you got
to ask yourself, it's just about what do you want to use it for? I kind of think about it
right now, and just because in my own little world, back when we started work on AI
and radiology, everybody jumped to the conclusion that AI and radiology has to
diagnose somebody. No, it doesn't. It has a massive amount of utility throughout the
entire workﬂow and process of radiology.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-12

assay? Did I wanted to write my presentation? No, I did not. But I might want to do it
to learn about how an enzyme. Or yes, you can ask some interesting questions like
that. So I think it will. I think the type of technology will have and should have a utility
in healthcare. I'm not saying that it does today, but I think it will. And its utility will be
diﬀerent than maybe where some people want to leap to. It doesn't have to be that
far of writing up a medical report and discharging a patient.
And then for generative AI, I think there's been -- Alex, who's just here just already
has proof points how you're able to now discover novel targets and therapies that
are in human trials. So that is well underway and being proven. And so if that isn't
promised enough, but then where you have this large body of biologists and
scientists who may not come from the computer science world, what I love about
generative AI in these language models is we can now interrogate them in an
interpretable way. So we can now learn together that the computer science
community and the science community can learn this together and really start to
unlock biological meaning.
We know we don't know enough about the genome. So these models, my hope, is
that they're going to help elucidate a lot of that. And then generative AI, like DALI,
where you can go from one domain to another from text to an image, how could that
not have massive utility in going through the diﬀerent types of data sets in
healthcare, from health records to genetic marker to what they saw in your image to
what your pathology report is looking at?
So with the likes of Genomics England and U.K. Biobank, we're looking at, can we
harness these new big data sets to see if there's a DALI in healthcare that has utility.
So it's not a panacea. It's a utility. It's a tool, right? And the whole point is can we
accelerate? Can we increase our understanding and really move this ﬁeld along and
ﬁnd more therapies for patients who need them? Thanks for the question.

Questions? I'm going to put my semiconductor cap back on because your chips and
your hardware systems are the foundational building blocks, right? And you guys
unlock all the innovation via your vertical markets with the platforms. The team just
rolled out its next-generation compute acceleration platform, the H100. That's based
on the Hopper architecture, 4-nanometer, leading-edge manufacturing technology,
80 billion transistors on a single piece of silicon, one of the largest chip designers in
the world.
Typically, the team focuses a lot of its eﬀorts on cloud and hyperscalers at their early
stages and followed by enterprise and vertical segments like healthcare. Talk to us
about the adoption curve for the team's prior generation A100 platform, and how do
you see the uptake and momentum for the next-generation H100 that the team is
rolling out now?

A - Kimberly PowellYeah. I think it's going to be incredible. So we've already started early access and
early work in the area of genomics, as I said, right? There's an insatiable demand for
compute to deal with the amount of data that's coming oﬀ those instruments. And
the more throughput, the lower the cost. So we already have a tremendous pickup in
that.
What I'll say is, in the past, you had to wait for the technology to come up and
become available. Well, we're moving at speed of life. And throughout the ﬁrst
quarter of Q1, you're going to see H100 popping up in all of the public clouds, tens
of thousands of them. So we're very excited that it's going to be readily available. So
these workloads can automatically take advantage of it.
And with some of the incredible features that it presents from a perspective of these
large language models, it has a transformer core in it for the transformer large
language models, it has in it to really squeeze down the eﬃciency and take these
large language models, which would either be very expensive to inference and be
able to do that very eﬀectively. So I think it's going to be a rapid migration to H100,
and the market is prepared and ready for it.
