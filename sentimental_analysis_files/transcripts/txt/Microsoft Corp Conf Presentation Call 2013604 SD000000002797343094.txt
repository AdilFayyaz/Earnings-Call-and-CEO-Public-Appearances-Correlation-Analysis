Thank you. So much for coming out to our conference in muggy San Francisco.
Delighted to be able to introduce our next Company. Bob Kelly, Corporate Vice
President at Microsoft in the Server and Tools Business and (inaudible) in the IR
Department. Bob's going to be talking about his business for about 15-20 minutes
and then we'll open up for questions and answers. With that, Bob, take the stage.
{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
Thank you, Kash, appreciate that. It's good to see everybody here. As Kash
mentioned, my name is Bob Kelly. I've been at Microsoft for almost 17 years. I have
done everything you can possibly imagine in the Server and Tools business. And it's
a pretty wild time in our segment right now. And what I wanted to do is just set some
framing essentially for you for how to think about the Server and Tools business. It's
one of those, I'm expecting that since you're here you know it's not a little secret. But
it's a little secret to the rest of the world about this business that we have that's
almost $19 billion large. So let's tell you a little bit about what we see going on in the
ecosystem.
But before I do of course, this presentation does in fact contain forward-looking
statements. And so take them as they are.
There are a few things to remember about the Server and Tools business. The ﬁrst is
it's really a big business. It's a $19 billion business for Microsoft with a ﬁve-year CAGR
of 11%. That's pretty stunning and if you look at underneath that, the hardware market
this year, the server hardware market, is going to decline. So growing 11 points in a
market that's actually declining is really pretty shocking. Very, very strong business
for the Company.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 2 of 15Our contribution margin continues to grow year-over-year at nearly 50%. This is a
very, very healthy business and getting healthier every year. There are six separate $1
billion businesses within the Server and Tools business. That is a remarkable
statement. Having started on Server and Tools when Windows Server was shipping
3,000 units a month to a business that's now got six separate $1 billion businesses
across the management, the database, the OS category and more, is a phenomenal
achievement.
And yet we're also continuing to grow our share position. We have grown 4 points
over the last year in Hyper-V market share. That's versus VMware and the market
itself. SQL Server Premium, our high-end SKUs are growing greater than 20% over
the last ﬁve quarters. And Windows Azure, if you will, the new addition to our
portfolio has added over 50 services just over the last year. Remarkable, remarkable
success story and actually one that we think is really just set for its next phase of
growth.
There are some things I want you to understand though as we see them. Because I
think for you to understand how we see them will help you frame up how you want
to look at our success or our failures.
There are really four fundamental transformational trends that are occurring in the
ecosystem. And these trends are all built oﬀ of sort of the underpinning, if you will, of
the virtualization of compute, storage and network. The computer, storage and
network virtualization.
These four trends you see outside the ring, they're very important because it's
actually these trends that are forming the strategic direction that we're taking for the
Server and Tools Business.
The ﬁrst is these new social and app patterns. You see Facebook and Twitter and
Pinterest and LinkedIn. Massive scale. But these new social and application patterns
are really driven oﬀ of a whole new set of verbs like share. They have intelligence
built into them. They auto-ﬁll search. These are really intelligent applications that
have a very new paradigm for how applications are being built. And it's not just
consumer applications, these new kinds of apps are now ﬁnding their way into the
commercial sector as well.
The data explosion. This is a staggering statistic. 90% of the world's data was created
in the last two years. IEC is predicting 44X growth of data over the next ﬁve years.
Now this could either be the most daunting thing that hits customers or a
tremendous opportunity to drive new applications and new scenarios around
insight. And that's how we're viewing it. We think there's actually this really unique
opportunity where data becomes the new platform and the tools around data, the
Oﬃce 365 and the BI category, really become very, very powerful for where the
customers actually derive new value and new scenarios for their own businesses.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 15The consumerization of IT. How many of you are carrying a smart phone or an iPad?
Or maybe even a Surface, dear God. Consumerization of IT is a reality. This is
something that is so true -- every one of us is bringing these devices into the
business and expect our applications to be there. This is a huge burden on IT. They
have to build new systems to secure, to manage and stay compliant with corporate
policy on devices they do not control. By 2015 it's forecasted that there will be more
than 2X the number of smart devices than there are people on the planet. This is the
new reality and business has to deal with that new reality.
And ﬁnally, cloud computing is just exploding like crazy, whether that's Windows
Azure or AWS or Google's cloud platform or Salesforce or Rackspace, just
tremendous capacity being built. When you have that much capacity with these
other trends, you have a really unique opportunity to create new value and to go
drive transformational change, both within the industry and within the customer.
Now, we are responding to this aggressively. And we call this cloud OS the modern
platform for the world's apps. Fundamentally what's happening to this new world is
going to require a new way of managing systems. A new way of deploying services.
A new way of what today we think of as resource management that an operating
system does, now at global scale. Now a system that's distributed across millions of
servers in order to deliver against the needs of those transformational trends.
So this modern platform for the world's apps fundamentally transforms the data
center. And I need you to think of the data center not just as the four walls that some
customer owns. But instead the walls are now logical and they're now wherever their
applications are. And so this new cloud OS has to take into account that the data
center's being redeﬁned.
It enables and empowers people centric IT. It turns out actually it's not just the
devices that are important, it's actually the user experience. The user has now
become the center of IT, not the other way around. For so long it's been that central
IT made the decisions about what users did. In this new world, the users are making
the decisions and IT has to deal with it. IT has to manage, secure and comply.
This new platform will unlock insights on any data, small, big, whatever kind of data
you want to have. The key is insights. It's not about the data per se, it's really about
what can we derive from the new patterns that are emerging and a new ability to
actually see into shocking amounts of data that otherwise three years ago we would
all thrown away and discarded. Now you can actually keep that data and actually do
really interesting things to ﬁnd out more about your users, about your business and
therefore take better action.
And ﬁnally, this modern platform also enables a whole new class of business
applications. This cloud OS is really a whole new construct. It's no longer thinking
about things as a singular machine, it's now this vast distributed fabric that enables a
whole new class of applications, a whole new case of user scenarios and in fact a
new way of thinking about IT.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 15So what makes the cloud OS unique? Microsoft's approach to this, with this cloud
OS, is to have one consistent platform that spans the customer's data center, our
own data center and third party service providers. One consistent platform that
allows the customer to deploy applications or solutions or infrastructure where they
want to. But expect a certain level of consistency. This cloud OS enables ﬂexible
development.
What that really means is we will support not just dot net in a world-class way, we'll
support running Linux on our fabric, we'll support PHP and Java. In fact, we do today
at scale. Flexible development means also that the developer, the customer can
build an application and decide where to deploy it later. That's the way the customer
wants to build applications. They want to build them and deploy them wherever they
see ﬁt based on what their business needs are.
But this cloud OS also needs to have a uniﬁed management approach. Our uniﬁed
management approach means a single pane of glass through which the Company
can look at all of their assets, no matter where they're deployed, on their premises,
on our premises or in third party. That is a really important part, because at the end
of the day what today they think of as their data center, tomorrow is now just a
logical boundary and they need to be able to manage all those assets through that
one single pane of glass.
As part of that, they need a common identity fabric, meaning you need to be able to
log into a set of assets that are deployed anywhere on the planet and be able to
federate across multiple platforms. You need integrated virtualization across this
platform, one that has the common layer for virtualizing any part of the stack on my
premises, your premises or third party service providers and ﬁnding this complete
data platform. So this cloud OS absolutely is unique because it actually enables this
set of capabilities against the premises where customers want to deploy their
applications and their solutions.
Now it's not just us talking about this, we have tremendous momentum. Tremendous
momentum. What you're going to see on this slide is a lot of ampersands. What that
really means is our approach is fundamentally an and approach, not an or approach.
It's not the private cloud or the public cloud. It's not Microsoft or the service
providers. We have fundamentally an and approach.
93% of the Fortune 1000 use Active Directory as a primary log in and our Windows
Azure active directory has 265 billion authentications against it. It is the same
software, with 3 million entities, corporations, businesses using Azure Active
Directory.
46% of the databases deployed in the world are using SQL Server. And 300,000
SQL Azure databases in Windows Azure. Similarly on the 76% of enterprise apps are
using Windows Server and we have over 100,000 websites hosted in Windows
Azure. All of these are in. Our core strategy is to deliver a fabric that's cloud OS that
allows the customer to deploy their solution where they see ﬁt. And that's reallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 15Q - Kash Rangancritical because the customers tell us every single day that IT cannot get in the way of
them running their business. They must be able to actually do what they see ﬁt,
based on whatever rules or regulations they have in play.
We've had a tremendous year of product momentum, tremendous. Whether it was
Windows Server 2012 or System Center 2012 where we neutralized the playing
ground vis-a-vis VMware and have now a competitive oﬀering to go take a bunch of
share. Or SQL Server 2012, where we really upped the game and show signiﬁcant
revenue growth and share adoption in our database category. Or Windows Intune,
our management server. A SASS oﬀering for managing the PC environment. These
are all tremendously successful products for us and are accelerating our growth in
each of these categories.
And of course over the next 12 months we have signiﬁcant products coming as well.
In addition to those, as I said, 50 new services that we've delivered on Windows
Azure this year, we just yesterday announced a whole new set of updates to
Windows Azure as well at our Tech Ed event down in New Orleans. Windows Server
and System Center Blue, which you've heard on the Windows client side of Windows
Blue, Windows 8.1, there's also a server release coming at that timeframe where we
will bring a bunch of the innovation that we have around Windows Azure into the
server release itself. So that customers can take the advantages that we have of
Windows Azure and deploy it on their premises.
SQL Server 14 has a feature called Always on Backup, meaning that it actually literally
is doing a continuous backup into Windows Azure and the customer therefore has a
disaster recovery solution built in the box. Cloud BI, visual studio, Windows Intune,
all of these are key products that we will innovate on and reiterate on over the
course of the next 12 months.
With that, that is a quick view of how to frame the Server and Tools Business through
the lens of this cloud OS. There are lots of diﬀerent categories we play in. The
database category, the OS category, the management category. And we're
incredibly successful. But as the world moves to these new demands it's imperative -
- our customers tell us it's imperative that we have a fabric that enables them to
deploy solutions anywhere they see ﬁt.
So with that, I'm going to pause and we'll sit down and take some Q&A. Thank you.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Thanks so much, Bob. So I'll ask a couple of questions and feel free to jump in with
your questions as well.
We've heard a lot about as the work that Azure -- or you guys have been doing with
Azure and Amazon Web Services has been talking about their infrastructureFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 15A - Bob Kelly
Q - Kash Rangan
A - Bob Kelly(inaudible) strategy as well. How do you see Azure playing alongside AWS? Is it
going to be a head-on conversation or are you guys in diﬀerent segments of the
market? How do you see your unique strengths and points of diﬀerentiation versus
Amazon Web Services?
{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
I see a couple of diﬀerent things. One is the ﬁrst and foremost there are lots of
buzzwords around cloud. Infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, software
as a service. They're all diﬀerent ways of thinking about the core capabilities, if you
will, of the platform.
In real terms, infrastructure as a service is just sort of the current application model
but delivered as a rented VM from the cloud. Platform as a service is a set of
managed APIs. What Windows Azure does is it delivers both. We have a full set of
platform as a service capabilities and a full set of infrastructure as a service capability,
meaning that customers can actually deploy both the existing application model and
the new application model into Windows Azure. So that's what it is.
We feel very good about what we've built. But the reason why we think we're actually
going to be successful versus Amazon is really because at the end of the day we
think we're targeting the enterprise customer ﬁrst and Amazon is targeting the
startup ﬁrst. Those are two diﬀerent starting points. I'm not trying to denigrate their
business at all, they've done a successful job of really capturing momentum around
the startup ecosystem. But the presence we have in the enterprise space, if Amazon
owns the consumer credit card, Microsoft owns the enterprise credit card. And if we
can establish this beach hold where customers can actually extend their data center
into Windows Azure using IAS or pads, we think we have a really, really strong
position and diﬀerentiated oﬀer versus AWS.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Got it. We hear a lot of private clouds, public clouds. You guys have a public clouds
oﬀering. You also have a product load oﬀering which you enable product data
centers to. Where do you see your customers spending most amount of investment
dollars? Are they going towards public clouds or private clouds or what's
interestingly called hybrid clouds? Which (inaudible) there?
{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
Well obviously based on our strategy we think that the end state is some notion of
hybrid, between our cloud, their cloud and a third party cloud. And given where we
are in the life cycle, if you will, or the adoption of public cloud technologies, which is
relatively early in its life cycle, the vast majority at least of the spend against Server
and Tools, of the $19 billion, is on software that customers are deploying on their own
premises. But we have very, very, very early signs of very strong momentum.
Last year I stood up here, I told you that we had 100,000 customers on Windows
Azure. Today we have 200,000. We're adding 1,000 customers a day. We have
30,000 customers who have adopted our infrastructure as a service oﬀering thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-04

Q - Kash Rangan
A - Bob Kellywent live in April. We really just have seen tremendous momentum. We have 50% of
the Fortune 500 who have at least one application on Windows Azure.
So we have very strong momentum. Additionally, if you look at all the software that
we sell as cloud software for Server and Tools Business, either delivered through
Azure or delivered through the service provider, that's over $1 billion in the trailing 12
months.
So we've seen really solid momentum. We have tremendous capability in private
cloud and huge revenue and we're starting to see the early signs of software
delivered through Windows Azure and through service providers getting to scale. So
a long way to go. But really good start.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
As you look at the business model and (inaudible) when (inaudible) if you like, is
(inaudible) a business model of Azure, the public (inaudible) oﬀering versus the
private is more ratable (inaudible) acquisition versus the license. I know that in your
core Server and Tools Business the majority of the business is structured as a
programming contract that's ratably recognized. But when you look a the
incremental value of an Azure deal versus a regular Server and Tools deal, are you
breakeven from a revenue dollar perspective, margin dollar perspective? What is it
that you've gained? What is it that you give up? The puts and takes of that?
{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
This is one of those questions where you know I'm not rally going to answer it.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
I'm going to answer a diﬀerent question. Put it in context. Today the Server and Tools
Business, which is $20 billion revenue, is in a category of enterprise software of
about $100 billion. That $100 billion participates in a total $2 trillion IT business. We
think what's happening here is actually the entire $2 trillion is being dusted up.
Entire $2 trillion is up for grabs. And there are going to be major winners and major
losers in this transition. Okay? So we actually don't look at it as a cannibalistic or a
substitution risk. We look at it as really signiﬁcant potential for revenue and margin
dollar growth.
Second thing to remember, every analyst I've ever looked at says about 70% of every
enterprise IT dollar is going to maintaining existing systems and only 30% to new
capabilities. So if you could unlock the ability to deliver the backlog of apps, there's
huge opportunity there as well. That's what we're seeing. We actually see that this
cloud thing is additive to our business, not subtractive. And because we have such a
strong position on premises, with multi-year contracts, we're able to monetize that
transition to the hybrid world very eﬃciently and very eﬀectively.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-04

Page 8 of 15Q - Kash Rangan
A - Bob Kelly
Q - Kash Rangan
A - Bob KellySo with the macro we're playing in a way bigger pool and we believe fundamentally
that it's additive to what we're getting today. And we can transition at the rate the
customer wants to. So for us it feels a win-win.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
And if you look at the large enterprise, we've got 7,000 of those using Azure. What
are some of the applications and workloads they're running on Azure?
{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
We're seeing everything, right? Obviously you see everything from Cheeseburger or
(Zingali) consumer facing applications. Then you go into the core enterprise and you
see applications like a company called EasyJet. EasyJet is a company in Europe that
does basically seasonal ﬂights. That's kind of the core business model. The way they
used to have to do it before was in spring they'd ship a bunch of servers and people
to a site in an airport, stand up systems, collect the fees, collect the tickets and then
collapse it all and go.
Well now what they do is they actually have a handheld, a scanner. They use
Windows Azure as a giant service bus in the cloud that's integrated with their
mainframe. And so now they have this cloud fabric that allows them to completely
transform their business using existing assets.
Or you've got companies like Milliman, who are doing Monte Carlo simulation where
they actually need tremendous compute capacity. But only on demand. So they can
stand up thousands of compute nodes, run a simulation, pass oﬀ the answer and
deﬂate all those. Very, very diﬀerent application patterns. But both very real.
We also see Boeing has built a consumer facing experience for immersive -- they
wanted to show oﬀ the Dreamliner. So they wanted a consumer facing experience
for how to sort of see what the thing it like. And they built this really rich client fed
application. So everything and all the above. And we'll see more and more and more
of the core, if you will, transaction capabilities of applications on prem moving to the
cloud as well.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Got it. The (inaudible) talk about and the industry itself has been talking about the
management of an automation oﬃcer on top of the virtual machine installed. How
big is your VM install base and how do you view the management opportunity? How
is Microsoft going to monetize that?
{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
If you look at IDC's data, IDC has Hyper-V share just north of 30% and VMware share
just about 55%, if my number's correct. We. And as I said, we've grown a point a
quarter over the course of the last four quarters. Aggressive growth and we will get
to a point where in essence in the enterprise space it'll be two platforms. Customers
will have a Hyper-V based world and an ESX based world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-04

Page 9 of 15Q - Kash Rangan

Q - Kash Rangan
A - Bob KellyThe money is not in the hyper visor. The money is in the automation and in the
management. Our systems and our portfolio, one of our $1 billion categories, is a
very important piece of the way that we monetize. But more importantly it's also a
very important piece of the strategy for this cloud OS.
The cloud OS, again has this construct of deploy the application wherever you see
ﬁt, whatever suits your need best. System Center is the single pane of glass that
allows you to manage, monitor, provision, update all of those applications wherever
they sit. So our strategy is really fundamentally about unlocking the power of that
cloud OS.
A ﬁnal thing I'll say is for those customers who do want to migrate oﬀ of a competing
stack, System Center can manage ESX and can manage and provision that
infrastructure as a customer decides to move over.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Are you seeing customers do that?
{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
We've seen a tremendous interest, let me say it that way because there's still -- we
released 2012 last October-November. Tremendous interest from customers of
moving oﬀ of or deploying next to ESX over the course of the next 12 to 18 months.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Are you more bullish on the database industry or your vertical gain share in the
database industry?
{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
Absolutely the latter. The thing that's happening across the ecosystem is -- or I
should have said both as an option. Well both is an option. But I think you have to
say more. I think our -- look, if we -- our revenue is growing 20X %. If you look at the
industry for the database category, it's growing 6%, 7%, 8%, somewhere in that
range. So we're growing anywhere from 2 to 3X in that market. That's a good start,
okay?
The competitors have a stronger position than we do in that category from a revenue
standpoint. And so we have worked -- but very, very strong product, very strong
momentum.
Additionally, as you look into the public cloud space, this is unlimited opportunity for
us. And as applications kind of migrate to that new world of delivering databases of
service, the whole notion of tier 1 apps gets disrupted. And the iceberg that Oracle
holds in the enterprise will start to melt. And it will melt because the market's moving
to the public cloud as a way to consume and deliver that service, not because we
were chipping away at it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-04

Before I turn it over to the audience, what are your thoughts on the open source
initiatives, open stack, closed stack? What do you feel from your customers as to
whether they want Microsoft participating?
{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
I'd say it's a complicated answer. The ﬁrst is honestly I don't think open stack has a
chance of having any success in the public cloud. And the reason I say that is the
economics of the public cloud are such that you have to be at extraordinary scale in
order to derive and deliver those economics. It's just ﬂat out true. And the only
players that are going to be doing that at scale are the Microsofts, the Amazons, the
Googles, maybe the Salesforces. But they're very, very few and far between. Because
it's such a huge capital outlay. It is such a huge commitment.
So for someone to take -- for OpenStack to be successful in the public cloud, one of
the bigs would have to take OpenStack and completely weld that thing to their oﬀer.
That's the only way it will ever get to scale and real usage in the public cloud.
Now if you look at the private cloud, I think actually OpenStack does have a likely
shot at gaining some traction. And for somewhat good reasons. I mean the
ecosystem historically has never wanted a one-horse raced. It prefers a two-horse
race and if you could have a three-horse race, that'd be great. So I think that there
will be enough momentum around an OpenStack like (Plaeda) from HP or from
others for private cloud.
So very diﬀerent dynamics. I like our chances in both worlds. But I ﬁrmly believe that
the public cloud space is one that just won't have any momentum.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
And (inaudible) to the private cloud, are customers pausing because they're
evaluating OpenStack? Would their assessment of the maturity of OpenStack, vis-a-
vis your guys' product (inaudible)?

If someone could ﬁnd me a customer who's deployed OpenStack at scale, I'd like to

{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
Yes, I know there are some. I know there are. I have not had the chance to talk to
them because they're just hard to ﬁnd. There's an awful lot of interest in OpenStack.
There's not an awful lot of deployment. That's the big diﬀerence. And quite frankly,
as it moves forward if it needs to have Hyper-V or System Center integration. And
customers demand it, we'll do it. We're not afraid of that by any stretch of the
imagination. I just don't see enough momentum behind it yet, I see a lot of noise.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Got it, okay. At this point, are there any questions from the audience?
You're ﬁrst to China with the Azure platform versus AWF. Can you talk a little bit
about the partner that you chose and your expected uptake?
{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
One of my core responsibilities is actually China and speciﬁcally for delivering a
Windows Azure oﬀering into China. The company that we've chosen to work with
over there is 21Vianet. Essentially there are really four players you could work with
over there. The telcos and 21V. And so in real terms, it was imperative that we work
with a local company that's part and parcel of what it will take to actually operate in
China to comply with local regulations, et cetera. And it was also imperative for us
that we do so in a way that is actually beneﬁcial to the ecosystem at large. And 21V is
the number one non-telco hoster at data center operator in China. So we chose
them for very speciﬁc reasons.
There is just unending upside for us in China. Unending upside. As all of you know,
we have a massive piracy challenge across Microsoft software, particularly in China.
Steve has said in times past that it cost the Company billions of dollars a year. That's
a lot of proﬁt. That could be utilized in lots of good ways. So it's much harder to steal
a service than it is to steal packaged software.
So services are going to be absolutely key to our success in China. We're very, very
excited about the early momentum. We have Coca-Cola, (inaudible), Redbox, a
whole bunch of really great customers who have adopted us in China and hopefully
later this year we'll be in general availability there.
Talk about the growth that you're seeing in Azure an the revenue growing and the
opportunity for Microsoft. But when I think about it from a customer perspective,
what is the ROI that customers are getting from going over to Azure and how does it
compare to other platforms out there?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-04

ROI's a funny because at the end of the day they have to have something to
compare it against. And really that's not how customers tell us that they're looking at
Azure. What they're looking at Azure for is actually agility, not cost reduction. And
actually it's because fundamentally they can't deliver what they need to deliver in the
current construct. Even with server virtualization, it still takes too long to provision the
environment, to provision the application architecture, et cetera.
If you had an instant on capability, then you can get to the application much faster.
But that's actually the ﬁrst thing we're seeing is actually agility, not like TCR or ROI.
So very few of the customer (inaudible) look like that. Whereas all the on premise
world looks like that. Tell me about the ROI, et cetera. So public cloud, at least from
our experience, doesn't look like that just yet.
Given your relations -- I mean given your install base at how important you are on
premise today, isn't that a little bit of a conﬂict of interest if you're, I guess, trying to
free-up maintenance dollars? Essentially those maintenance dollars could have paid
the guys that were -- buy your products or have them buying the products for
decades. Isn't it a little bit of conﬂict of interest that you might have to manage or
may not be best positioned to manage when you're trying to grow this essentially
disruptive or really disruptive technology?
{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
Again, it's not the kind of conversation we typically have with the customer. It really
does turn out, everyone here is familiar with what Andreessen said, right? Software is
going to eat the world. If you look at the $2 trillion of IT spend, the vast majority of it
is in non-hardware or software things. It's in maintenance, it's in people costs. And all
these things are actually -- software can automate. That's really the play. So it's not so
much that we have a conﬂict of interest, it's really much more about the fact that
where you talked about software automation, sometimes you do get people saying
what does it mean for my job? Right? Do I have that problem?
But every time that this has occurred, more jobs have been created, not fewer. And
what happens is you shift where people do their work. Why should people be doing
the sort of plugging together of things if you could automate that? That's always
been the sort of value of software in an IT.
So most of our conversations are more about what scenario can I unlock? Not if I use
public cloud, do I have to lay oﬀ my IT staﬀ? We rarely hear anything like that.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
I had a question on your growth rate in the business is far and above the server unit
growth rate. Can you just help us break the gap between that growth rate and the
server unit growth rate? What is that?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-04

So there are a few things. I'm glad you asked this question because it's another
important way to think about what's going on with Microsoft and how we're thinking
about our play. Over the course of the last 18 months, we have fundamentally
changed the way that we license our database and our OS/management products.
The database was always licensed by the per PC or per box. We ﬂip it to per core.
On the OS, we went from per box to per CPU. Why?
With virtualization and core density, there was just so much more power out of each
of these boxes. And so customers weren't having to buy as many boxes and
therefore we weren't monetizing it eﬃciently. So by ﬂipping the core and CPU, we
actually are able to more eﬃciently monetize fewer boxes and we now have a
common unit of monetization across the private cloud and the public cloud. Those
are two very important parts of how we're going to market and how we actually drive
more value. So even in a shrinking hardware market, we're monetizing more
eﬃciently.
The second big thing that we've done is --
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
More for the timing when you made the transition?
{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
Well over the 12 and -- 18 months. Depends on which release we're talking about.
SQL's about 18 months, (inaudible) Windows is about 10 months ago, okay?
The second big thing that is happening is we're seeing a tremendous shift to our
premium SKUs. Through a combination of the density and the desire for customers
to soak their boxes longer. And our licensing packaging around our premium SKUs
is shifting our dollar per unit dramatically up.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
I'm assuming the rough map, you had about 200,000 customers for Azure, about $1
billion run rate. It's not a big amount of money per customer works at about 5,000
boxes. So I'm sure there's a pretty big distribution of customers that spend a lot
more money, a lot less money. Where are we in the adoption cycle relative to a
customer's IT budget and where is Azure slotted in? And how would a customer
think about spending more money there for new projects?
{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
I'll answer the second question ﬁrst. It's absolutely for new projects. That's absolutely
where we see the dollar slowing. Everyone's carrying these devices around, every
app has to get mobilized, if you will. There's a whole new set of scenarios that are
coming because of these apps. There's data and BI and just huge scenarios that are
being unlocked. And customers are saying new apps. That's the ﬁrst thing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-04

trillion. Even if you take AWS at $2 billion and you take us at whatever number you
want to take us at, there's still a rounding error on overall category. So we are very
early in this cycle, it'll play out over a long period of time. It's material but not
material. It's going to take time for us to see this burn itself out.

I'm surprised nobody asked about Rackspace. This is another infrastructure of the
service company. What do you, (inaudible) is the lead analyst on this stock. Do you
ever see Rackspace as a contender in the enterprise?
{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
Well ﬁrst of all, I love Rackspace. I mean they're a great company. I really do. And the
reason I think they're a great company is because they have a very unique value
prop, which is maniacal support. And there are lots of customers who will pay for
maniacal support full stop. They don't have the technical capability, if you will, of a
software driven company like us. But that's not the point. They have a very loyal
customer base. Will they have penetration in the enterprise? Of course they will. Will
they have the app scale advantages we have? No. They don't have the cost structure
to do it, nor quite frankly do I think they have the appetite to do it.
So I think they're a real player, I like them. At the end of the day, I wouldn't trade my
position for theirs.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Got it. With that, that was very insightful. Thank you very much. Good to see the
product of Azure and thank you as a customer coming out (multiple speakers).
{BIO 16032998 <GO>}
Thanks, everybody. Appreciate it.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Thank you for your time and presence as well. Have a great day.
