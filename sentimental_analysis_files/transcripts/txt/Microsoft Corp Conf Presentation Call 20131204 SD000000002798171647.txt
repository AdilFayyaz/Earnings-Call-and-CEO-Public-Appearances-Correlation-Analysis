Presentation
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
All right. Good morning, everyone. Very excited to have Ali Baba here but we are
going to transition onto the next keynote. Anyway, very excited to have Microsoft
joining us; Terry Myerson, Executive Vice President of Operating Systems. So the way
I'd break that down is you are the platform dev guy. So last time I checked platform
was kind of important in Microsoft.
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
I think it's important to everything.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Everything, exactly. Before we get started, I just have brief remarks there. Before we
get started, Microsoft would like to inform you that this presentation does contain
forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements
about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and
assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially
diﬀer because of factors discussed in Microsoft's press release and the comments
made in the presentation as well as risk factors listed in the Microsoft SEC ﬁlings.
Microsoft does not undertake any view to update any forward-looking statements.
And with that said, I'm going to turn it over to Terry, who has a couple of sort of just
brief remarks to level set things and then we will get into Q&A and then we will open
up to the audience later. Terry?
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
Thanks, Phil. Let me start by complimenting you on your bowtie. It's very nice.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04

Thanks. I went all in today.
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
I thought I would start by talking about one question that is probably on many
people's minds and that is who will be our next CEO? This is probably -- there's one
thing that I can oﬃcially share on that front and that it will not be me. So hopefully we
can relax a little more in the next period of time.
So the group I lead at Microsoft is our Operating Systems Group, which includes a
family of products starting with our Windows embedded products, which has
enabled so many of our enterprise customers to get their industrial products onto
the Internet, connected, remotely manage them. And so forth through our Windows
phones, through our Windows tablets and PCs to the platforms and services which
power our Xbox product as well.
So it's a pretty exciting set of products to work on. It is somewhat humbling to work
on as well given all the diﬀerent users and the people that depend on these
products around the world. I get a lot of questions about so many of our products
are used in enterprise settings. We certainly get tremendous questions about the
consumer usage of these products as well and I think heading into the holidays,
there's quite a bit of cautious optimism that things -- this is going to be a good
holiday for us.
I just looked this morning at Amazon's website, reviews of some of the new tablets,
the Dell Venue Pro is running at 4.5 stars, which is pretty exciting for me to see
because I think just that sort of customer feedback and the customer response to the
product are kind of the most important thing and empowers us and gives us --
inspires us to do great work.
Our most recent IDC reports show us outselling the iPhone in one-third of the
markets they track, which is pretty exciting and of course the new Xbox One, we are
selling them as fast as we can make them and so trying to make more.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
I think you guys sold a few yesterday -- the holiday. That's great.
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
You know, we've just recently brought these products together into one group. We
are kind of -- we are very focused on shipping things for this year but our investment
thesis going forward is really rooted in the fact that we want to have one platform
that powers all of our devices so that developers can really target the aggregate
scale of Microsoft with their investments, the one thing that we have incredible scaleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04

Q - Phil Winslowwith these devices today in terms of getting our developers today target one device
at a time and we see incredible opportunity to make Microsoft the most compelling
place to develop our applications if we can bring both the innovations and the
audience together across all of our devices.
At the same time, each of our device form factors does require a unique tailored
experience I think to really delight the customer. Xbox has got this magical
experience on a 4-foot screen that I wouldn't want in my pocket on a 4-inch screen
and likewise I wouldn't want to scale up Windows Phone into a 4-foot screen. So
tailoring the experiences to each form factor is another key part of our investment
thesis.
The third one is bringing our cloud services together so that all of our devices can
take advantage of the cloud services, which have historically been unique per
device. We've had Windows LIVE. We've had Xbox LIVE. And now want all of our
devices to be able to take advantage of those.
So it is a very exciting time. Device categories are growing and expanding fast and in
many ways what we focus is on delighting customers because with each happy
customer we get, the future feels bright.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
With that said, obviously you now lead all the OS groups as you mentioned across
the Company. Maybe if you could give us a little more detail on your strategy of
actually bringing out that common development platform across all these diﬀerent
devices, like how are we going to actualize that?
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
Today Microsoft has many platforms. We have many platforms and many devices that
are out there. The number of devices that connect to Windows updates every day --
I'm not sure every day but within a month I think it's close to 1 billion devices every
month that are connecting with Windows Update. We have all of our PCs, we have
PCs which run on the desktop mode, we have PCs which run the tile mode. We have
phones. We have these embedded devices, we have servers and each of these
devices has unique ways for developers to target them.
And that is both a strength because it enables developers to do very targeted
applications for these devices but it also doesn't create the opportunity of the
aggregate scale of all those devices. So enabling developers to write a game which
can run on both Xbox and Windows is a very interesting opportunity enabling
productivity apps to run on the workplace but also on the phone and tablets, this is
just an opportunity we see we can bring to developers and focus on.

Q - Phil WinslowSo what are the beneﬁts to the end user as well in addition to the Company itself
from this common development platform?
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
Well on each of these device categories there's always the killer apps and then
there's the tail apps and they synergistically work together. On the PC, Oﬃce is the
killer app which drives productivity and it is this magical combination of Oﬃce and
Windows put together that makes these devices the core productivity experience for
people.
On Xbox, I don't know which alien shooting game is the killer app but each of those
-- there's these magical apps that put together with the Xbox platform drive the
consumer demand for the device. But our goal is to enable those magical
applications across all of our device categories and again, we are coming back to
sort of end-user apps but it's just as important are these embedded enterprise apps
and industrial apps that are just common across all Windows devices around the
world but we want to bring those across all categories.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Now you've been the head of this new group since July so I guess two questions.
Like what are some of the early kinds of progress in the strategy? But also too, what
are the hurdles or challenges that you foresee that you are going to need to
overcome over the next couple of years in this role?
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
Progress is always -- visible signs of progress will come from shipping products and
having delighted customers with those products and that is not something that takes
many years but it certainly takes many months. The products we just shipped this
holiday really were planned by individuals completing Xbox One, conﬂicting
Windows 8.1. These are challenging and exciting things -- I think we've just -- very
important products that deliver to the market and talked about the results from
those. But the fruits of the one Microsoft changes that Steve made really will be seen
in 2014 and 2015 and beyond.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Let's go back to a comment you made about devices. You talked about some of the
new Dell laptops, Asus, the two in ones.
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
That was a tablet, actually.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Sorry, tablets but then the Asus, the transformer book, these new devices, how is
Microsoft helping I guess your OEM partners bring some of these new devices to
market and sort of with the functionality but at the appropriate price points?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04

Every OEM conversation has this sort of bipolar nature to it. Every OEM has his
interest in participating and leading in terms of the premium category so they want
to -- they have -- each OEM, each partner has their view to the diﬀerentiation they are
providing and they want to invest in and they want to deliver that diﬀerentiation on
the Windows platform so they can participate in the premium category and capture
the margins in the premium category. And at the same time, each of these partners
is interested in the scale that comes from sort of the lower price -- opening price
point devices. And we engage with our partners on both of those dimensions.
What is the diﬀerentiation they would like to bring and invest in so the premium
device margin can be captured? Then what is the both the technology and the
distribution and business investments we can make to capture the opening price
point as well?
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Let's stick with the device theme here and John (inaudible), this is for you if you are
out there. So let's talk about ARM versus Intel. He's my semiconductor analyst. ARM
versus Intel -- I just want to talk about support in terms of your backwards
compatibility of the operating system and the applications and how you kind of
manage the backwards compatibility but also wanting to bring on new partners like
ARM, expand the device ecosystem there with Windows RT. How do you balance
that?
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
The core -- the familiarity with Windows and the compatibility Windows not just of
applications but also of drivers is the core of our business today. And it's interesting,
we talk a lot about applications but device drivers are a whole nother element to
this. As an example of this, I was with the customer weeks ago and there was a
discussion of printers that they purchased years ago and they've got to be
compatible with their devices and so there's this whole ecosystem built up around
compatibility with Windows that's incredibly valuable to our customers. And that
compatibility is x86.
It is a market which Intel and AMD serve. They are great partners and they are both
investing in very exciting innovations and we are partnering with them or
participating in the whole spectrum from the new innovation for premium products
all the way down through opening price points.
At the same time, the ARM ecosystem has its own set of rich innovations that we
need to participate in and the devices they are focused on. And so we've got a great
partnership with QUALCOMM and that's yielding some very exciting progress.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
All right. So we are talking about sort of the overall platform strategy Windows. One
more question about Windows before moving on to Windows Phone. But if we thinkFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04

Q - Phil Winslow
A - Terry Myersonabout 8.1, obviously a big interim release, maybe talk about how we should expect
sort of the cadence of we'll just call it big boy Windows versus Windows Phone. The
cadence of the versus -- we used to think about, okay, big launch, a couple years
later, big launch. This was kind of this intermarry 8.1. Is something changing with the
release of 8 and how you deliver to the platform?
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
With Windows we have a consumer set of devices.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Does this apply to all device categories?
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
There is a consumer set of devices and then there's what I will call an enterprise set
devices and one thing that we will continue to do and I think really -- the world has
shown that there really is two diﬀerent customers really have divergent needs. The
consumer really is ready for things to be upgraded on their own, things to be require
-- you are able to require a certain set of experiences and do things to consumer
devices that IT pros are not as -- they want to have -- this is part of the infrastructure
of running their business. So they value us giving them the policies and the controls
to do that.
With the consumer versions of our products and the enterprise versions of our
products or the professional versions of our products, we will be focusing on serving
each of those customers and delighting them and there may be diﬀerent cadences
or diﬀerent ways in which we talk to those two customers. And so it is 8.1 -- there's 8.1
Pro and they both came at the same time. That's not clear to me that's the right way
to serve the consumer market. It may be the right way to continue serving the
enterprise market.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
So let's transition to Windows Phone. Actually one of your partners, Nokia, Q3 had
good momentum in Windows Phone. It seems like some of that is picking up. Where
are we on Windows Phone and what do we need to see in Windows Phone to take
that next step to bring the market share higher?
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
Windows Phone has got a product that -- it's kind of like so many of -- it's done quite
well in what I will call the opening segments, actually. It's getting to delivering a
high-quality experience in opening segment really is a tremendous software project
and a very important -- it is important hardware (inaudible) to get done as well. But at
the place where excellent hardware engineering -- sorry, excellent software
engineering where someone can really focus on tuning the experience on a tight
electrical bond is a place where we've been able to diﬀerentiate, take share in
double digits and outsell the iPhone in many markets.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04

Q - Phil WinslowIn the premium categories, it's a place where we've delivered some great innovation.
I am very proud of the Lumia 1020 work, the work that we've done on the camera
with Nokia there and we are exploring innovations like that with other partners now.
But I think really our success with Windows Phone is going to be proportional to our
success with Windows. As Windows grows and becomes more vibrant and more
important in people's lives than the PC, then they will want a Windows Phone with it.
So to me the most important thing for Windows Phone success is Windows success.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Let's talk about -- there is a little company you guys are buying called Nokia. And so
from a sort of platform perspective, you being the development guy, how does
actually owning the hardware OEM change I guess the development process or the
cadence that you can deliver a product?
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
For the operating systems group, we are focused on being a platform provider to all
of our ecosystem partners and so whether it be Dell, HP, you mentioned Asus, Acer,
Lenovo, these are all important partners that we will work with and in the highest
integrity way to deliver their innovation to our platform and to delight customers
together with their devices. So that's the most important thing from an operating
systems group perspective.
From a Microsoft perspective, having the Company's ability to innovate in hardware I
think is exciting for us to be able to create new device categories ourselves, to be
able to deliver -- in some ways Microsoft being able to deliver a premium experience
that is a pure expression of what Microsoft thinks a device should be does allow us
to also at the same time enable our OEM partners to diﬀerentiate and let their
devices be what they would want them to be. And so I think it's very exciting for
Microsoft. In the same way as having Microsoft store, having Microsoft devices gives
us the conﬁdence to let other partners go free and do their own thing.
And so I think it's just very exciting for Microsoft and then as a platform group, we
love all of our partners.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Let's switch gears to the Xbox now. I wonder if you could talk about the Xbox One
launch and sort of how you are approaching this versus 360 especially sort of just
with the context of sort of this total platform perspective?

The living room is an important -- it's a key part of all of our lives and the PC is a part
of our life from 9 to 5. Xbox in our living rooms and our homes is part of our lives I
guess from 5 to 9. And we do more with our families in that living room than play
games and shoot aliens. And so having the ability to innovate and delight customers
in that living room is just an important opportunity for us.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Then I guess how do you tie this into sort of the Xbox into that total platform strategy
across all devices? Where does Xbox ﬁt into this? Sometimes I get the question it's
like why do you even need Xbox? Is it part of the platform ecosystem?
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
I don't think there's any part of our -- what we do, we are one person both at home
and at work. We do work at home. Who we are as a person doesn't stop when we go
to work and so being able to provide a platform that people enjoy using throughout
their lives is just critical.
The entertainment assets we have developed through Xbox will diﬀerentiate our
PCs, phones. And tablets. The cloud services we built up through Oﬃce 365 and
Windows LIVE will help diﬀerentiate things we do in the living room. So it really does
all work together synergistically.
We do have these core Xbox audience of young men that is diﬀerent than perhaps
sort of the core audience or the Windows PC right now and we do have these two
brands, Xbox and Windows. And so sometimes those two diﬀerent assets can make
the conversation more complex but fundamentally the notion that people want a
device that can serve both their life and a work and play mode, I think it applies to
every device category and it applies to more than just Xbox. Xbox is a device and a
brand but that sort of under appreciates what that product is and what it means to
Microsoft.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
All right, let's go back to Windows now that we touched phone and Xbox. But one of
the things that people look at often is just the size of the application ecosystem tied
to a platform for the success. How many in the app stores that are -- how do we think
about where you guys stand right now with Windows 8 in particular and then also
Windows Phone? Then what are the goals of the milestones you want to see to say
okay, look, this is being accepted by the application developer community. It is a
vibrant ecosystem.
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
Windows 8 runs over 1 million Windows desktop applications today and so we start
with a notion of people are buying these Windows PCs. They are happy with these

think we have not done the work to aggregate the scale of Microsoft well. That's to
me the biggest opportunity with this new operating system is to bring all of our
devices together so that users can target all of them and there's tremendous
opportunity there for us to do good work to enable our developers to do good work
and it's just a big focus.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
I'm going to ask one more question and then I'm going to open it up to the
audience and then I've got a few more here if there are no questions from the
audience. But one of the things that resonated from what you are saying here is that
enterprise and consumer, that's a question I get a lot about Microsoft is can any
company sort of eﬀectively do both in one platform? So how do you respond to
that?
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
Well I think the answer is yes.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Hopefully. And why is the next question.
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
As I just think about -- it's what the customer demands. If you look at what the
customer is asking for from their products or what I want my products, I want --
there's going to be a set of devices in my life. I'm going to have a phone, I'm going
to have a tablet, I'm going to have a PC. And going to have a TV. I'm going to have
other devices and I'm going to use these devices as one person. I'm going to use
those devices during my day at work and I'm going to use those devices when I'm at
home.
And so we get focused on what -- we listen to customers. We respond to customers -
- what they want. We focus on the diﬀerentiation we can bring the customers on
each of those devices and this is what customers are looking for, what they need.
And so this is what we are going to do.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
On it. I will pause for a moment. I think there's a question up here in the front but
also just raise your hand. So one in the front and then if we could also get a
microphone in the back there ready for the second question.
Terry. Good morning. Thanks, Phil. A couple of two questions. One has to do with the
number of new devices that you were talking with the Dell device, two in ones,
tablets coming. What is exactly the consumer value proposition? There are a lot of
price points coming out. There are a lot of devices coming out. I walked into BestFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04

Page 10 of 14A - Terry Myerson
Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantBuy, walked through and said wow, there's a lot. But I didn't really -- it was more
confusion than it was clarity.
So what exactly is the consumer value proposition of these new devices and how are
you communicating that? Because if it's all hinged upon Windows, as a consumer,
there's not a lot on Windows that I really want to do on a smaller device that's a
mobile device. So I just wanted to ask that to get I guess overall the context.
So basically it is what's the value proposition on these new devices and why should
Windows 8 or Windows mobile -- sorry, why should Windows mobile really be
predicated on success with Windows because I feel like they are diﬀerent
experiences.
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
Well there's a couple questions in there. Who are our customers? Our customers,
who are the people that feel aﬃnity to the Windows brand? Who are the people that
feel trust and (inaudible)? There's 1 billion people or more that feel trust and aﬃnity
with the Windows brand. Windows helps them in their lives to be more productive.
That is the anchor. We're not talking about embedded industrial devices now, we're
talking about a consumer. So you start there and say those are the people that we
start with in terms of oﬀering them new device categories.
I think we talked about Xbox a few minutes ago. One of the things -- one of the
reasons I'm so excited about the Xbox platform being part of Microsoft is it does
bring tremendous entertainment assets, has allowed tremendous entertainment
assets to be developed within the Company and so I think we not only do some
good work to leverage all those entertainment assets across more screens but it will
be a critical part of our strategy in terms of diﬀerentiating us across all device
categories.
So it's not so much that a Windows laptop will be used at the same time with every
Windows Phone. It's a notion that you do start as you move into new adjacent
markets or new adjacent devices categories, you are going to look at and say who
are your current customers today and how can we extend our delight of those
customers or extend our business with those customers?
And phones is a diﬀerent market than tablets. But I do think that the individual that
uses a laptop is also interested in a phone. The individual that uses a tablet is also
interested in a PC. So that's the thesis about it all working together as one device
family.
What is that as a consumer, just what is exactly is that value proposition that's going
to push me -- again what I have in Windows and what I have with my PC is what I've
had for a while, I've had it in a work environment. It was my introduction to
computing. But it seems like the market is going past that. How do you get the
thought -- how do you get the consumers back into Windows? What's the valueFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 14A - Terry Myerson
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Terry Myersonproposition you are trying to create in the cloud for the consumer that's going to
draw them?
When you made the comment that Windows should be the driver for Windows
mobile that confused me because it's a little bit backwards looking from how I see it
but maybe I don't understand the vision.
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
I think I start with the customer base of Windows is that we are Microsoft. We are not
-- we have built oﬀ of what the great technology assets and customer base that we
have today to delight the customers we have more in new ways and serve them in
more parts of their lives. That is the core of the strategy of what we do.
A question on -- I guess there are some people that believe that Windows, the
operating system business, Windows in particular is bloated and operating expense
should be cut drastically and that the days of selling and operating system in the
mobile phone space or the tablet space are just over because that's been obviated
by your competitors. So how do you respond to that, number one?
Number two, that could be a particularly large source of cost savings for Microsoft.
Number two, given the new structure of the organization, how possible is it to
actually just take down the investment in consumer operating systems and we are
building operating systems for consumers that you plan to actually sell for a license?
Thanks.
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
So we invest in the operating -- I think you have to separate the investments we
make in terms of the experience we want to deliver for both consumer and
enterprises from the -- separate out the ﬁnancials. There is a level of -- there's
innovations we can deliver and customer delight we can deliver when we are
investing in the whole stack from the operating system through the applications to
the cloud. And so everything we do pivots oﬀ of delighting the customer, satisfying
the customers, delivering new value propositions to the customer.
So we can maximize that customer impact when we are working with a customer at
all layers of the stack. You start with that notion. If all you are doing is investing in one
layer, the stack, you are constrained with what you can do for the customer.
Now in terms of how we allocate our R&D resources or partition them across
diﬀerent layers of the stack, that's an allocation decision that Steve has made over
time and certainly bringing things together in the way they are now gives us a new --
a diﬀerent form of transparency on how we are allocating resources. So it's always a
discussion we are having about how to deliver the highest return from our
investments. But from an innovation or customer delight perspective, I thinkFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04

A - Terry Myersoneveryone involved can point to -- take our enterprise customers, the ability to invest
in security and management at the steepest layers of the stack does diﬀerentiate us
today with many, many customers. Does monetization change over time when we
delight the customer in that way? I don't know.
But you've got to start with the innovation thesis. You've got to start with how you
satisfy and diﬀerentiation, how you diﬀerentiate to the customer and the operating
system that Microsoft delivers today is fundamental to all of that diﬀerentiation we
deliver, whether it is at a productivity desktop in the enterprise or a game console in
the living room.
I know we are running out of time so just one quick question was Apple recently
introduced its operating system and all of its updates are going to be free. How does
that change your pricing strategy with Microsoft in the future?
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
As I understand Apple's announcement, they announced that upgrades to an
already purchased Apple product of the operating system would be free. Windows
8.1 is a free upgrade to Windows 8. And so --.
Well I did not say Windows will be free. We're going to keep the SOA intact here.
(multiple speakers) I said Windows 8.1 is a free upgrade to Windows 8. (multiple
speakers) And it's just something that not to be too repetitive but satisfying our
customers -- delighting our customers and aggregating the scale of our platform is a
big focus.

your ﬁnancial incentives are?

A - Terry MyersonSo just broadly I mean the question -- it's really interesting to delight customers with
the Xbox and things like that. But are you -- how do you think about revenue and
proﬁt? There's been a lot of questions about that and it would be great if you guys
could be dominant in Windows Phone but the reality is it's a fraction of what the
opportunity is in business operating systems. So how do you think about again kind
of devoting your resources relative to what the proﬀer pools are?
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
Well there's three dimensions of what we focused on. They really -- there is customer
satisfaction, scale and the ﬁnancial mix, the ﬁnancial return. They really do -- the
three of these things do work synergistically together over the long-term. The more
customer satisfaction we drive, that does help drive scale. Scale helps drive
longitivity of the platform and our opportunity to get value from our customer.
So we really focus on all three and in this audience, it seems completely reasonable
to me that the folks who want to be on the ﬁnancial return but certainly in terms of
leading the operating systems from Microsoft, all three have to be top of mind at all
times -- customer satisfaction, scale. And ﬁnancial return.
And in the enterprise space, we get value diﬀerently than in the consumer space and
there's diﬀerent macro trends going on in each but -- and customer satisfaction is
looked at diﬀerently in each. But focus on all three of those dimensions. My team, my
leadership team, our discussions with the Microsoft leadership team, we really do
look at customer satisfaction, scale. And the ﬁnancial return.

We use the safe word mistletoe on your pay plan. You won't have to answer that.
Actually one last question for me as we just have a couple minutes left here. But
obviously you have been tremendously successful with Windows 7; 75% of
enterprises are now -- the last time you reported on Windows 7. You've got the end
of life of XP coming up in just a few months. One of the questions I get is how does
the success of Windows 7 and enterprise impact the eventual adoption or not of
Windows 8 in enterprise?
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
The large enterprise deployments take place in waves and the Windows 7
deployments that are completing now started a little while ago and we are having
frankly some great discussions right now about enterprises moving to Windows 8 or
8.1 and adopting the beneﬁts of Windows 8.1. Years from now we will be sitting on
the stage hopefully talking about the deployments, the great deployments of
Windows 8 point something, 8.1, 8.2. I don't know. I am not announcing a product
release.
But through enterprise deployments or this gets back to the enterprise versus the
consumer question, consumers are in this place where they expect the software toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-04

these deployments as mission-critical infrastructure that they want to manage the
rate of churn of and that is a way of doing business that we embrace and support for
enterprise customers.

Perfect. We are at the mark. So I appreciate your time, Terry, coming down. Like I said
before, its executives like yourself that make this conference special. So thank you for
coming down.
