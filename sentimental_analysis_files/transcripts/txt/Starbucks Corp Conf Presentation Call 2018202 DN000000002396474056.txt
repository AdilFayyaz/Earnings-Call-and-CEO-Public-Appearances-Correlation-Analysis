{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Good morning. Welcome to BI & CohnReznick webinar on the restaurant Industry
through the year 2020. So I am Mike Halen, I am an analyst here at BI. Just quickly we
will go through some administrative notes. We're going to record this and send it out
for playback, also send out transcripts of the meeting. You can access the replay via
the link that you used to sign up. At the bottom of the slide window, you can change
the volume and maximize your screen to see the slides a little bit better. Feel free to
ask questions by submitting one to the right of the slides. We're going to try to
address as many as we can near the end of the presentation. And a copy of the
slides will be distributed via email.
So quickly; BI, we cover hundreds of industries and sectors doing sell-side like
research for Bloomberg. Our stuﬀ can be accessed via the terminal on BI . And I'm
going to kick it over to our moderator, Cindy.
Thanks, Michael. So today, as mentioned, we're going to be talking about the state
of the restaurant industry over the next few years; so what's going on now and where
we see the trends going over the next couple of years. We've had a lot of dynamic
changes in the industry, obviously, over the past year. So we're going to kind of focus
on a couple of areas. One, we're going to talk kind of from a macro, how the
economy is looking at in the markets. And then we're going to kind of go into tax
reform. Obviously that's just something very new on the docket here and has been a
real game changer, strategically how people are thinking and where we're going to
go. And then of course with all of that, we're going to lead into the consumer trends
and technology and how the market and how the new trends are really going to lay
out over the next couple years.
So, with that, I have some wonderful -- as you see there on the slide, some wonderful
speakers with us that are going to help us navigate through that. I have Gary Levy,
who is CohnReznick's next Managing Partner of our Consumer, Hospitality &
Manufacturing Practice. I have Michael Halen, who is the Senior Restaurant &
Packaged Food Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence; and Sarah Lockyer, Senior Vice
President at Restaurant Business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-01

Michael HalenSo, with that, I think let's just go right on to the content. Let's talk about the state of
the restaurant here. Let's get to that ﬁrst slide. We always like seeing graph. So this is
an interesting one. Michael, let's have you kind of kick it oﬀ. I mean, what is driving
the same-store sales growth? Is it price, traﬃc, where are we headed here? What
does this all mean?
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yeah, as you can see, sales have decelerated since January of 2016. We've seen
things pick-up a little bit here in the last few months based on MillerPulse data, it's a
third-party data provider that we use. But price increases are being mostly oﬀset by
traﬃc declines. So restaurants aren't exactly knocking the cover oﬀ the ball right now
in terms of growing sales. I mean, there's some -- a bunch of diﬀerent things going
on right now. Independents are taking share on providing local ingredients, which
they can do better than national chains can. Ethnic cuisine is also attracting
customers that cannot get the same type of food at a Chili's or an Applebee's.
There's also been a widening gap between the cost of eating at home versus away
from home. So what we're seeing is people are brown-bagging their lunch maybe a
little bit more frequently or cutting back on their visits on restaurants. And then
ﬁnally, income growth has pretty much been ﬂat now for the last decade, but
healthcare, student loan and rent costs are all increasing.
We do have this little boost here over the last couple months. We tend to think it's
transitory, part of it's due to very easy comps and a lot of it's been fueled by casual
dining chains. So in our view that turnaround really isn't sustainable, because they
haven't ﬁgured out a way to attract millennials to their stores.
Another big reason why we've seen kind of weakness over the last couple years is
oversupply. So this is just a chart of the top 100 chains. So we're not even talking
about independents here, we're not talking about emerging fast casual brands.
We're just talking about the top 100 chains and a lot of them including -- a lot of
them -- this includes a lot of casual dining chains that are actually ﬂat to shrinking
units here in the United States and it's still up 13% since the recession. So there's a lot
of restaurants out there, a lot of these new restaurants are taking sales away from
existing ones. Another issue (multiple speakers)
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
Sorry. It's Gary. Just wanted to weigh in. You also have a lot of restaurants that have
private equity money behind them and obviously they are being fueled for growth
and adding more stores pretty quickly, and that's not even in the data or in the slide,
so signiﬁcantly more restaurants coming online.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yeah and landlord -- and retail struggling. So landlords want restaurants and they
bring foot traﬃc into their developments. So all of this is weighing in. And we talk
about the big change in trends and this chart really exempliﬁes that. There's a huge
demographic shift going on. Millennials now are the largest generation in the UnitedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-01

Page 3 of 18Cindy McLoughlin
Michael HalenStates. Baby boomers are retiring at a very rapid clip. They're moving to more ﬁxed
budgets and they are spending less money out at restaurants, speciﬁcally casual
dining restaurants.
So what's interesting is they've done a little bit better over the last quarter. Think
about Darden especially, maybe Chili's, they're kind of trying to get back to -- reach
back out to their casual dining, baby boomer casual dining customers with nostalgia,
menu items like Applebee's riblets and chicken ﬁngers that attracted these same
customers maybe 20 years ago. So we've been calling it kind of a bird in the hand
strategy where they kind of start pushing so hard for the millennials that they've
been unable to attract anyway. We think this is smart near-term, but casual dining
restaurants still have to ﬁnd a way to get the younger generations in their stores to
survive long-term.
Another shift that we're going to start to see is that the millennials who throughout --
their coming of the age have been visiting restaurants at a much higher clip than
some of the other generations out there. Well, they are starting to settle down, get
married, have kids, buy homes, so this gives them less money to spend out at
restaurants as well.
And then on the cost side, we are still seeing minimum wage increases, so 18 more
states in 2018 raising their minimum wages and three of them, California, Florida and
New York are three of the top four states in terms of restaurant spending. So another
headwind for these restaurants.
And, yet, we are seeing these valuations still are just crazy on every front. It's like
sustainability of this. I mean, are you seeing the earnings really being able to support
those kind of valuations or where do we sit with that?
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yeah. So earnings are being boosted by levering up and refranchising, especially in
quick service restaurants and these chains are using the proceeds to repurchase
shares. So you're seeing in EPS, maybe not as much in net income, but the EPS
growth is deﬁnitely there. I mean, but there's a couple of other things also going on.
Stocks have been on ﬁre despite these headwinds, A, due to tax reform and the
hopes around it; B, it's the best house on a crummy street. It's really hard if you're an
investor to tell your -- if you're a hedge fund manager or a mutual fund manger to
tell your investors that you're buying department stores and retailers right now.
People don't want to hear it, because of the Amazon threat. It's a lot -- people feel
like they can sleep easier at night owning restaurants versus retailers. So that's part
of it, a lot of money is just moving from retail into restaurants.
And I'd say the last one is that M&A has really boosted valuation. And with that, as
we see it, it's likely to remain high, especially in the ﬁrst half, tax cuts and cheap
money are going to continue to motivate buyers and sellers after a pretty big yearFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-01

Michael Halenfor deals last year. And as you mentioned Garry, private equity funds are searching
for smaller, emerging growth chains now more than they ever have. And so part of
this is due to the evolving customer demographics, behavior and taste. So they want
fast casual. They don't want casual dining. They want the ability to pick up and go
whenever they want. They don't want table service. So this shift -- with this shift we've
seen a lot of money ﬂow to these emerging fast casual brands and also the strategic
buyers are back -- some of them --
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
Sorry to interrupt. I was just going to say, you're deﬁnitely seeing it with PE activity
being, new PE funds coming into the space and strategics to getting very active. I
had seen several PE funds taken to private, and then -- go ahead, I am sorry.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yeah. No, that's great. So the strategic buyers and I guess, some of them never learn.
I mean, it's not easy to house multiple brands under one roof. And over the last 20
years, they haven't gone really that well, but there's pressure on the top line. So,
some of these chains, speciﬁcally restaurant brands Darden and Yum, they're looking
to acquire pretty sizable change chains with signiﬁcant growth prospects here in the
US, and also internationally. We've seen all of these raising a couple of billion dollars
to buy additional restaurant chains. And then on the low end, you've also seen
chains like Cheesecake Factory make investments in smaller growth concepts just to
look for another growth engine for them.
With the tax reform and everything and all the sort of access to capital on every front
now, and obviously also coming out of the tax changes, I mean, this is giving these
companies that capital to invest in other units or doing strategic acquisitions as well.
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
And I was just going to add that, it's typical. Historically in the last part of the decade
strategics get active and start doing transactions, that's usually historically what has
happened and you are absolutely seeing that.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
So, just I'm going to tie up this part with a little reference to tax reform. And despite
the PR spin that you're really seeing, most of the tax reform cash is really going to be
going back to buybacks. There'll be some spending intact and investments in labor,
because they need to stay competitive. But listen, like I said earlier, chains have been
levering up. Now that with leverage ratios that are near the high-end of their
comfortable range, they can't borrow for buybacks anymore. Most of these chains
now, especially in quick-service are 95% plus franchise. So they can't re-franchise to
bring up to -- to drum up more cash for buyback. So the boost to free cash ﬂow,
most of it is going to go to fund stock buybacks.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-01
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 18Cindy McLoughlin
Gary LevyAs I mentioned, companies like Starbucks and Brinker mentioned, they're going to
make some investments in labor, because the labor market is tight for restaurants.
But remember, last time, Starbucks raised wages, they actually cut employee hours.
So this just goes back to the point I made about chains being in PR mode and trying
to say the right things with the tax reform backdrop. But investment dollars will be
allocated to technology. I mean, the companies that are doing this well, Domino's,
Panera, Starbucks to name few are picking their pants oﬀ their competition. So these
chains know that these investments have to be made, and the ones that do it well are
going to be the ones that take share.
Okay. So now let's sort of shift a little bit to what tax stuﬀ means. You're going to see
a lot of these public companies, when they are reporting their earnings, and as
they're starting to ﬁle now, a lot of these really large sort of wacky non-cash
adjustments on the tax side and all of this [ph] is a fallout obviously, because of the
eﬀective rates in going forward and how they're having to adjust for their deferred
taxes. So you kind of have to muddle through some of those things, those
adjustments as you're seeing it. But you've seen kind of a lot of that out there in the
press on the larger companies, and how that's really impacting them. But let's shift
through all of that and kind of move forward into sort of the main ideas and main
things that are out there, and how it's going aﬀect hospitality companies speciﬁcally.
So, Gary, why don't we go forward here and talk a little bit about some of the
positives and the negatives and sort of highlight that and step through this.
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
Alright. Thank you, Cindy, and thanks, Mike. Good job laying the foundation. Let me
say this in the very back [ph] the disclaimer about some of the things we are going to
talk about, because the code has not been written yet, it's been laid out. But it
actually now pending to be -- taken out to paper by the lawmakers and the actual
code disseminated throughout. So maybe it's a good idea of what it means, but the
ﬁnal rules aren't out there yet, so -- and I'm sure there will be some adjustments as
we go.
The Tax Cut and Jobs Act or as I call it, the Trump Tax Plan, it's really a -- if you are a
believer in the Laﬀer Curve and sell-side economics and that being working, then
this is a plan you're going to like. That is yet to be proven, but that's certainly
something to keep an eye on. There is some pretty good positive things about this.
They are right there into some negative things. And you need to be proactively
thinking about how these pieces of the code work, because in one area you may say
this is a great thing, I'm going to do this. But one of the bad things in the code may
kick into play and eliminate what you're trying to accomplish. So you really have to
take your time, be proactive, and bluntly do the modeling. Think about where you
are taking the company, and what your goals are.
There's going to be a transaction and an exit, when do you want to do that. We've
been meeting with a lot of companies and lot of PE funds to help them look at thisFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-01
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 18and decide, hey, what's the right entity, what portion of this tax code should we
seriously be thinking about implementing or trying to navigate around. So the
positives are pretty simple. There is lower tax rate both for C corps and for
individuals, we'll talk about that a little bit more. The C corp changes are permanent,
the individual rates kind of sunset over diﬀerent periods of time, something to think
about. And the positive thing is, this pass through tax deduction, that's for ﬂow
through entities like S Corps and LLCs that qualify. There's a nice deduction there
that is going to be very beneﬁcial to restaurant owners.
They've opted the depreciation rules and increased bonus in Section 179 that
signiﬁcantly encourages investment in the industry as you build restaurants. They've
also kept the tax credits that are pretty important in the industry. The FICA tax credit
and The Work Opportunity Tax Credit known as the WOTC. Every year, there's always
banter about eliminating the FICA tax credit. I was pretty sure it was going to go
away this time around, but they've kept it. That's a really good one. And the WOTC
credit is something a lot of restaurant companies have been using, and more
recently, more and more are looking at it, because it helps alleviate the rise in
minimum wage, as well as it gives access to a larger labor pool. And if you're not
doing that, I think that's something you should be looking into. Those credits can be
very signiﬁcant, those dollars add up. We've been helping a lot of companies look at
that and ﬁnding the best way to implement it.
And lastly, there's some favorable international tax regulations. I'm going to touch on
that. We could do a two hour webinar just on that alone. Bottom line, that's really to
make the US more competitive on the world stage and help repatriate some dollars
into the US. The negatives, the limitation on state income tax deductions and
limitation on new mortgage interest. Well, if you live in a state that has high income
taxes, this may not be so beneﬁcial to you and certainly if you have high property
taxes, it's not going to be beneﬁcial for you. And I just don't see how that does not
hurt the housing, the valuation of houses in certain parts of the country. There are
some limitations on business losses, those are confusing. They're going to have
some, I think, wide-sweeping eﬀects on some strategies people employee in
growing their businesses. And lastly, interest expense limitations that also come into
play that I think will change how deals are structured and how capital is raised going
forward.
So, here are the -- just a quick overview of the tax rates. You see the C corp rate is
21%, the AMP is eliminated, and like I said, this is a permanent change, so that goes
on forever. And you look at it and go, wow , what a low ﬂat rate I got for C corps, I'm
going to convert everything to a C corp. A lot of companies are looking at doing
that. I would say, hey, take a breath, because there are beneﬁts which I'll talk about in
a little bit, so ﬂow-throughs. And you see down here, the lower -- the new tax rates
on the left are the old rates, on the right are the new rates. And what you can see if
you look at the bold areas, not only the rates go down, but the brackets also got
expanded. So if you look at the bottom, the 39.6 rate is now 37%. And so that's a 2.9
percentage drop in rate, that's terriﬁc. But then if you look at the bracket, the income
brackets have also gotten higher. So that 2.9 -- sorry, that 2.6% is actually higher, and
you have to think about it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-01
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 18Cindy McLoughlinThe other thing to think about here, and people to lose sight oﬀ, a lot of people are
in the alternative minimum tax on an individual level. So they don't get the beneﬁt of
that state income tax deduction, that got eliminated. So it really doesn't matter so
much to people in the AMP [ph] and they get the beneﬁt of the lower tax rate. So the
tax cut will result in a windfall for them, obviously encourage investment. If you're not
in the AMP and you live in one of these states, well, then you may be in an adverse
situation, but you have to look at it. That's gone.
So one of the other beneﬁcial things is this pass-through deduction. It's basically a
20% deduction on what -- it's called QBI, qualiﬁed business income. There are some
limitations within the calculation you have to run, but what it really means is you have
K1 income that's from a qualiﬁed business, you're entitled to take 20% as a
deduction right on your return. Simple example that's up there is you have the
restaurant, it's $500,000 of QBI or I'll just simplify it as K1 income. It's got some
wages of 1.5 million and qualiﬁed property of 3.0. You run through all that math, but
the short story is, on the 500,000, 20% or in this case $100,000 would be
deductible.
Things that would oﬀset it would be wages of the business, but typically restaurant
wages are signiﬁcantly high as a percentage of sales and the real estate portion of it.
But I'd say most restaurants are going to be falling into that 20% of the K1 income,
that is signiﬁcant. That all of a sudden makes 37% tax rate for ﬂow-throughs versus
the 21% for C corps, that closes that gap a lot more and a lot faster.
But other things to be aware of in this, not all industries qualiﬁed for it, restaurants
do, but accountants, lawyers, celebrities, professionals don't qualify for that 20%
deduction rate. So what that really means is, Cindy and I are in the wrong business,
but to some reason, engineers and architects are absolutely able to qualify.
The other thing and this isn't clear, remember, I said the code has not been written
yet, it's not 100% clear. But a lot of restaurant companies do licensing deals or
management deals. It typically is, if it's with a celebrity chef or high-branded
restaurant company, they don't own the restaurant, the hotel does, the real estate
developer does, and it's basically a management deal. It's not clear if that type of
income structured that way would qualify for this 20% QBI deduction. The code
hasn't been written. The conservative approach is, no it won't, the more aggressive
approach might say it is. And no one has the answer to that. We spent some time in
the oﬃce kind of debating that, because we represent a lot of high-proﬁle celebrity
chefs and clients that have that situation. And so we have to look at it and maybe
think about how you structure the deal better to take advantage of the QBI.
And Gary, just one thing. I will -- sorry, Gary, just another point on the management
company or the management side that you're saying is that also applies, if you think
of many of these private equity and how they are structured, a lot of the fund
structures have management companies set up in there, so that may be a structure
or may be a setup that won't be -- because those would not generally beneﬁt fromFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-01
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 18Gary Levythis, because of the limitation, those management companies within a fund. So that
may be something elsewhere to eﬀect in another avenue where you'll see that eﬀect
on the PE side too. So just another thing similar to, like you said, in the license deals,
how that will eﬀect those entities.
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
Yeah, I think that has to be brought into play. I'm not sure if the management fee
piece that gets paid it would be eliminated by that. I think that's okay. At least, that's
what I was led to believe, but haven't conﬁrmed -- haven't read the code in so much
detail to say the answer to that one.
International, let me just touch on this quickly. So people are aware of it. Again, it is
pretty complicated. This slide has tons and tons of words on it. And I don't profess to
be an international tax expert, people around me did really know the stuﬀ and
actually gave me this slide. But simply put, there's a couple of things in here. One is
the repatriation of foreign income and cash back into the US at a much lower rate,
it's 15.5% and a real beneﬁt of that is you can pay that tax over eight years, right, so
that's a really nice windfall for companies to bring that into the much lower tax rate
and pay it over eight years. The actual ﬁrst payment is due April 15 of this year and
the calculation isn't that easy. So I'm sure a lot of companies are going to be
struggling with that calculation, but it's certainly going to be a windfall.
The other one is that we've changed ROE, modiﬁed our tax systems to now be more
in territorial systems, and that basically may provide foreign entities such as US
entities with foreign operations, brought in subs [ph] to bring income back and to
potentially avoid tax. And the last piece is, going forward, in similar situations, we're
going to be at a much lower competitive tax rate depending on how we're -- where
business is being done on the global stage. So the international changes to the code
are signiﬁcant part of this tax plan, and it's really to make the US more competitive in
tax rate with what's going on in the world.
So that was the good news. Some of the bad news, and again, remember I said
before, you got to think about how things -- how this tax cut plays out with all the
pieces, don't just look at it at one section and say this is great, because you could get
bitten from other side, if you're not. So the limitation on business losses, this is new.
It used to be, if you had a business and then had a big loss and you were at risk for
the money in that business, and active, even if passive possibly, but predominantly
active, you can take that loss fully on your personal return and move on. And almost
in some cases have the ability to wipe out taxes that you would owe for the entire
year. Well, now they said -- the new rule says, we're going to limit the ability for you
to take a loss on your personal return. If you're married, it's $500,000; if you're
single, it's $250,000. That's a big change.
The example here is, say, you have a couple, married, their wages are 1.2 million, one
spouse is a breadwinner, the other one runs a business that loses a lot of money, so
there is an $800,000 ﬂow-through on the loss. Under the old rules, they'd be paying
tax on $400,000. Under the new rules, they can only use 500,000 and they'd beFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-01
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 18Cindy McLoughlin
Gary Levypaying tax on $700,000, that's a big change. The other side of the coin on this is the
$300,000 that's carried over to next year, you're limited to only using 80% of that.
So you could have a situation where you lose the beneﬁt of that $300,000. I'm sorry,
I just realized that we skipped over a slide. Did we skip over? And I'm sorry to do this
to everybody on the panel, did we skip over the depreciation slide? We did, didn't
we?
Yes.
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
Yeah, we did. So let me just go back to them. Sorry I hit the wrong button. Good
thing is, it's important to bring this up, because the new depreciation rules give
100% bonus to assets placed into serve in the restaurant, that will encourage
investment, the opening of more stores. Even according to Mike, we have too many,
that will encourage investment, absolutely a good thing to have. We have a situation
where you have an existing restaurant, it's got $1 million in proﬁt, will now use that
money and go build the new store, you can get $1 million tax deduction to eliminate
any tax eﬀect that would have. That's terriﬁc and very encouraged. And Section 179
that includes to $1 million from $500,000, all good things for the industry.
But you just have to be aware on bonus depreciation that the states typically do not
recognize bonus. They decoupled from it. And what they make you do is add back
the depreciation on the state returns as active income, and you could have a
situation where you have passive investors who have now active income ﬂowing
through to them, because of bonus and passive loss from the ongoing from the
business, and they could have an adverse situation where they own money to the
states, and a loss they could not use. You need to be aware of that. Absolutely need
to be aware of that. And then you can take Section 179, states recognize that, so then
take 179.
But the thing to think about is, if you take bonus or 179 to that matter, that lowers
your QBI, your qualiﬁed business income, and lowers that 20% deduction we just
talked about. That might not mean anything, but it's something to think about,
especially if you take bonus, you have that state add back as I talked about, and then
you don't even get the beneﬁt of the QBI on the federal level. A lot of moving parts,
a lot of math that's got to be done to see what's in the best interest.
All right, so let me skip on. And as I said, these will sunset, and you can see in here
that the rates go down over a period of time. So bonus will eventually go away
unless the law changes. Sorry for skipping ahead what was important. We covered
that, we talked about the limitation on business losses. Same situation, bonus
depreciation here could generate signiﬁcant losses that you may not be able to use,
because once you get to that $0.5 million, you're stuck, and then 80% can only be
used as loss going forward, adversely aﬀecting the beneﬁt of having bonus
depreciation. Think about those things and the ramiﬁcations.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-01
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 10 of 18Next one, business interest expense limitation. This is also brand new, and the
bottom line here is that, this will basically say, you are allowed to deduct interest up
to 30% of what -- they it's a adjusted taxable income, ATI, it's really EBITDA for now,
and 30% of what your EBITDA is. And eventually it goes after four years from now in
2021, it just goes to EBIT. So now depreciation is part of that component. But in the
reality, as so many restaurants are ﬁnanced with debt, people structure deals for the
raises, there maybe a debt component. You do a private equity deal, they will
leverage up the company if a debt is relatively re-accessible, it's inexpensive to get
done. So they're going to use the debt to grow the company.
You could have situations, in the past, it would be like, great, interest is fully
deductible, let me take that. That really helps. Now under this new limitation, the
beneﬁt of interest possibly will not be deductible depending upon the math,
especially when it goes to EBIT, or even as you add stores and you grow. So those
are things that you need to be aware of, and I think will dramatically change how
private equity funds structure their deals and even potentially aﬀect valuation,
because they may not lever or put as much debt on these businesses as they could
in the past. And obviously, that would aﬀect the ability for them to do valuation.
And one thing to note is if your gross receipts are less than $25 million, you don't
really need to worry about this. But if you -- that doesn't just -- if you have multiple
restaurants under separate umbrellas you may have to combine all those sales, and
that might get you over the $25 million hurdle, so that's something to be aware of.
Again like I said, you move piece one way, and that's just another piece on the
puzzle you need to be aware of it.
All right, so just other things you need to be aware of when you need to cover as you
go into this that again aﬀect the industry, (inaudible) employee meals are now only
deductible for 50%, and in 2025 they will not be in deductible at all. Most
restaurants will provide staﬀ meal pre-service, free lunch, breakfast, and there will
staﬀ meal that's made available, that could add up, because there are still lot of
people you're feeding over time. Well now, you can only deduct 50% of it, rather
than deducting the full amount of it. Some restaurant companies, often the
employees they bill it oﬀ the menu at discount that may be an oﬀset to it, but -- and
this could be a pretty signiﬁcant add back or cost to a business, if they don't get a
deduction.
New audit assessment rules, this is also I think going to change. Our people invest,
do deals, I mean, invest in deals and kind of it really works like this. It used to be if --
there was an audit, the audit -- IRS came in and did an audit, when the audit was
done, whatever years were aﬀected, the people or partners in the business in those
years would share the burden of that tax. Well, now, the business is required to pay
the tax. I'm sorry this ﬂow through into these. The business pays the tax. So, let's say,
Mike and I are partners, he dies (inaudible) restaurant, I go away, two years from now
he gets audited, and there's a huge assessment on the business, well, the business
now has to pay for it. And that's from Mike and his new shareholders to deal with,
and I get to walk away walk away scot free from it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-01
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 11 of 18Cindy McLoughlinThat's a big change in the rule, that will also require some change to some operating
agreements about who is -- there's no longer a destination as a tax managed
partner. I think what you'll see more and more is, especially in the transaction model
PE funds, there if we are going do signiﬁcantly more diligence or they going to ask
for some type of indemniﬁcation for it. I just don't see how -- because they are going
to want to cover for that. The repeal of the Domestic Production Activities Credit, it's
known as DPAD, there's also as real ramiﬁcation as to the business. That was basically
if you had a commissary and I think you produce products for your restaurants, but
you also sell to third-parties, you would have the ability to do a calculation to create
a paper tax deduction, and it's pretty signiﬁcant, and this is roughly about 10% of the
company's taxable proﬁt.
And we've had clients that added deduction which worth hundreds if not, in some
cases millions of dollars depending on how things played out. That deduction has
now gone away. That's an adverse eﬀect of the industry and signiﬁcantly will eﬀect, I
am sure, planning for people. Now the good thing is UNICAP rules. They've upped
the ﬂoor on that. UNICAP is a calculation you have to do to capitalize some of the
costs for storing your inventory, like which would include a percentage of your rent,
some of your utilities, percentage of peoples and jobs that have stuﬀ to do with the
industry. That has also been up to $25 million, it used to be $10 million, that's good
for smaller restaurant groups, larger restaurant companies, it doesn't matter.
And then lastly, the hold period for private equity funds investment, carried interest
paid but now the hold period is now three years instead of it being one. I think
what's important about that, and I was talking about PE fund that I do, we do a lot of
work with it. He says, boy, that could put us in a conﬂicting position with some of our
portfolio companies. But you can make an investment in a company, grow it, and 18
months from now the business has grown so great, and people may say, hey, I want
to buy the company at a great valuation. Well, the founder might say, I want to do
that, because, well, that's a lot of money, and I'll take my chips oﬀ the table at a
capital gains rate.
The PE fund won't be in a capital gains rate position, and they may say, no, I don't
want to do it, because that could adversely aﬀect them from a tax position and they
are limited. It's something to think about. I think it's something that's going to come
on up in a bunch of deals and I think it will be debated and discussed. So, I tried to
cover as quickly as I could the high points that aﬀected the tax code. I will say, there's
a lot here to speak to, your own individual advisers. We are actually doing programs
locally that focus just on the tax code for the industry, and we even have done
numerous webinars, and I'm sure there'll be more to come.
So, I think that's all I had -- I did. So, I am going to turn this over to Sarah to take it
from here. Thank you.
Yeah. Gary, just one quick thing before we move on from there. Just a quick question
here. I know that in the past companies would have a change of control events ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-01

Sarah Lockyersome sort and that would trigger certain technical termination, clauses in
partnerships and then require changes in diﬀerent returns that needed to get ﬁled
and various things. And I believe that that's gone away, correct?
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
Are you talking about the technical termination? Yeah, the technical termination --
Yeah, the technical termination, so --
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
Yeah, that is going away, absolutely. Well, that's a good thing. I mean, that's more of
an administrative thing. It's kind of (inaudible) do anyway, pardon my language. So
that was good to get to move on from there.
Right. Okay, good. All right, wonderful. So now that we have this tax reform in
companies that strategically have done right or going to have all those excess
money and cash and things to do things with here, I guess in order to invest properly
and whether it's technology, they really need to be looking forward, looking at
trends and where the consumer is really headed and what they are wanting. So,
Sarah, why don't you give us some road map as to where we should be thinking?
Yeah, absolutely. Gary, that was a great breakdown, and Michael obviously a good
macro view of the industry. It's funny, Michael, when you mentioned that the PR
spend and investing back into the labor force, that's clearly what's happening, and I
think what's gathering a lot of the headlines. But a lot of companies are already
saying pretty clearly that, with these tax savings, we're putting it back into our
business, McDonald's said 6 billion I believe into the US market to re-image its
stores. Brinker as well is re-updating its commitment to re-imaging the stores. And
well that can be a lot of like window dressing, a lot of that is also technology base,
kitchen display systems, kiosks, automation, tablets for wait staﬀ things like that. So
tech is clearly where a lot of this hopeful windfall will be. I'm happy to take that if you
want, but, yeah, you can advance that, that's great.
I hope everyone can see this, it's a little small. What Technomic -- I am at restaurant
business by the way Sarah Lockyer and a partner company of ours is Technomic, a
leading market research ﬁrm, I'm sure many of you are familiar with. And we do
various studies often about where the consumer is at in relation to what they want
from the restaurant industry from a technology standpoint. And I thought this was
extremely interesting and timely. This was done mid-'17. So nothing has changed
since then and we will be redoing this survey in the ﬁrst quarter of this year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-01
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 13 of 18But what I saw that was very interesting about this slide here is that consumers really
do see technology as a value add to their restaurant experience. And in this ranking,
you can see something as simple as free WiFi, it's still very important to them. So a
lot of the forward thinking restaurateurs and chains are always thinking very fast
about mobile payments and mobile ordering and what's next, and voice recognition,
and things like that. But sometimes the basics really do help and making sure you
have fast free WiFi is very important to the consumer.
What I ﬁnd very interesting though is this notion of tracking your order, whether
that's in-store or through delivery, or when you're picking it up. I think consumers
particularly on the younger side are very interested in control and they want to see
exactly where their order is, has it been accepted it, is it being made, when will it be
ready, I'm pulling into the driveway and do I have someone outside ready for me to
pick up my order. So tracking is extremely important as well. You can see there some
paid numbers and some mobile ordering numbers, which I can get into a little bit
more detail on the next slide.
Kitchen automation system is listed here. It seems pretty low from a consumer
standpoint, but I have to be frank, I'm not so sure how many consumers would really
know what that means to them. I think if this question was more getting my Fruitini
on-time with the right ingredients, and everything I ordered that would probably be
at the high end of this list, but nonetheless it is there. So I thought that this is really
interesting kind of hit list of what restaurant chains and restaurant executives can be
looking at to make sure that they are indeed oﬀering some value to their customers
in the way that they perceive to be the most valuable.
So how important is mobile ordering really? Well, mobile ordering, if you're a
millennial, it's extremely important. You can put lot of colors. So it's time to digest it.
But this is oﬀ of about 1,000 consumer surveys and this is a kind of standard Top 2
Box Survey, so very important or important, is mobile ordering option important
when you actually decide to go to a restaurant. That's the key there, not just in
general. I mean, you can see that the millennial age group pretty closely followed by
Gen X, ﬁnds this very important.
Michael had mentioned, casual diners and how they're going back to their roots and
making sure they hit on the nostalgia and get some of the boomers in there, maybe
some of the older Gen Xs in there, but then what's next, how do they really relate to
the millennial. And something like this could be very important. You see 60% of
millennials, so that's 25 to 34 years at casual dining rate, mobile ordering options,
important or very important. So casual diners have to get on board with that,
because I think what that obviously speaks to is convenience and speed and being
able to order ahead and being in the car perhaps with your young family and
picking someone from soccer, getting on your phone, ordering a meal at Chili's and
being able to go pick it up. So I think that the casual dining (inaudible) technology
will be a huge way that they can ideally kind of get themselves out of the negativity
that they've seen over the last couple of years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-01
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 14 of 18When you get to mobile pay, you see that it's not exactly hitting everyone in the
same way. So it's not as important as the ability to order on your phone. I do want to
make a note for some data geeks, little bit like myself. You can see that this switched
from a wonderful breakdown by age group to a breakdown by measurement. I don't
know why that is. If you want to reach out to me and see if can get the matching
slides I would be happy to do that. Technomic does fantastic work and a lot of it is
based on customer reports for clients and things like that. So this could have been
perhaps a request as opposed to a survey set apples-to-apples. So, that's my
apologies. Nonetheless, I do think the trend line remains at payment on your mobile
is important, of course, but it's not quite as strong as we're seeing in the 50s and 60s
of important range when it comes to actually being able to order on your phone.
And it looks like it's pretty standard across the board here in terms of the segment
breakdown.
So royalty and rewards, I would deﬁnitely place under tech. I think if anyone is still
using a punch card, it might be time to upgrade to something either via mobile or
other. You can see that these do indeed matter. Millennials and Gen X in particular
are looking for these loyalty rewards and they are using mobile platform to redeem.
These whatever mobile they want, and they are looking at restaurants that have the
right loyalty programs for them when they are deciding who to visit.
I think the millennial generation right now, most of us sometimes think about the
teenagers. I think that's still in people's head that millennials are these teenagers on
their phones, but they are not anymore, they are parents, they are younger families,
they are dealing with the same economic stresses that many people are, if not more.
And things like loyalty programs, any types of discounts, any couponing, anything
that helps them ﬁnd the right deal and the right value that then gets delivered to
their phone, which is where they live. Is this really a good recipe for getting that
customer through the door and ideally getting them to come back.
So we also -- so that's a lot of mobile, but I also want to talk a little bit about tabletop
ordering, which again back to the casual dining point, what can casual diners do in
particular to do some tabletop ordering options. Chili's has seen some pretty good
results with their partnership with Ziosk. I know that the average check is extremely --
is much higher and I knew that it's something that they look forward to in terms of
the data that you get on the customer and how that can be used on top of the
customer dining experience. But this again here is the importance of how important
you read [ph] providing of tabletop technology when deciding which restaurant to
visit. And you can see a big whopping 42% millennial at the family restaurants and
43% Gen X access casual, which I thought was very interesting. But nonetheless, you
see some pretty high numbers here.
Millennial and Gen X is well over indexing the entire overall percent number.
What's really interesting, I didn't add this here and I probably should have, I don't
think this is pretty obvious I think for those of us who have families, but the Gen X
and millennial use of tabletop ordering is mostly due to content for children. So if
there is content for children on those tabletops, people are very happy and they goFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-01
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 15 of 18Gary Levy
Sarah Lockyerto that restaurants and they sit at that restaurant and most likely order another drink
or order another dessert and that's where you get your check up and that's where
you might lose a little on the time of the table, but you are getting that check, you
are getting that customer to come back the door.
So these tabletop options for casual dining in particular are indeed important. It isn't
a novelty. I think years and years ago when they were ﬁrst starting to roll out
everyone was kind of like, they are just doing it to cut labor and maybe that's part of
it, but it really has become something to customer actually enjoys that isn't just about
the P&L and the labor line.
I went kind of quick, but I also wanted to do a real quick look at -- the theme here
was kind of Restaurants 2020. This might not be two years out, this might be a little
bit more, but there are some four buckets that restaurants, chains to small should
really be looking at and some are really looking at when it comes to where to invest
in technology. Voice recognition software obviously is something that the whole
world is a little bit obsessed with right now with Alexa and everything else. And that
will be important.
People do want to order Domino's from Alexa, they just do. They want to be able to
order their Starbucks order from their car. This stuﬀ will happen. But what I see
actually as some of the bigger beneﬁts to the restaurant business itself is back of
house voice recognition potential. So operations, I believe has the largest potential
here for general managers to be able to control their inventory, to be able to get
very smart, very real time alert to be able to order, what they need quickly via voice
that really drives eﬃciency. It can lower labor costs, it will make your general
managers much happier people, which could help with retention. But the day of
saying, Alexa, I need another case of vinaigrette actually will happen. And I think it
will happen soon and I think it's something that businesses should really be making
sure they're staying at least aware of.
Progressive web apps are something that doesn't get a lot of sexy media attention,
but Panera or Dunkin' or Starbucks, you're really not going to get space on your
customer's phone. I don't know how many restaurants look at their funds right now
and see how may restaurant acts we have, but it's probably not that many.
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
In research, there is about -- people average about three.
There you go. I mean, there is just no space any more, and that's not how people
want to really interact with their phone and with the brands they like. Nonetheless,
you want the option to order ahead to get coupons to be marketed to get deals.
And so a web app is not an actual app you have to download, basically it is a mobile
site, basically a website that's mobile friendly, they call it progressive, because it
works on any browser, any tablet, any phone. The experience is very seamless for theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-01
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 16 of 18Cindy McLoughlincustomer, for the consumer, for the user. But it does allow less money in terms of
app development and it is something that I believe consumers will start doing more
and more. I believe Apple also just released some code type release that's way
above my level. But that makes the building of these progressive web apps and the
usage of them oﬄine a reality very soon. So I think that will be something that a lot of
restaurant chains, at least some are starting to look at.
Facial recognition, isn't just the new iPhone, and it isn't just Amazon Go which just
opened, but you know CaliBurger, it is using facial recognition software at their
kiosks. It's not for payment yet, but it's to connect your loyalty program, and it's to
connect to any formal orders you had. So again, that's something that when you are
looking out to 2020 and beyond to be aware of. And then I think something that we
could spend a whole webinar on it, it would deﬁnitely not be me, it will be all of
great digital players like OLA or HotSchedules, or others. But Big Data is ﬁnally
moving into kind of that real data time world, where it's not just overwhelming data
anymore that no one really knows how to use. The tech companies have become
very smart, they're partnering with each other, they are layering their services on top
of each other and making it really easy for restaurants to oﬀer the things that
consumer wants, and making it easy for the actual business to start understanding
their own customer's needs.
So there is not a lot of excuses anymore to not be playing in that space since you are
not using the data to your beneﬁt as a business.
So it's a quick overview on kind of where tech is headed. I do think that one thing,
and I forget if it was Starbucks or Panera, but technology as a lifestyle or technology
as a way to drive convenience is the way that winning businesses and winning
restaurant businesses really look at technology. It's less about what app you have or
do you oﬀer this or do you provide x, y and z. It's really about understanding what
your customers want. Not every customer is going to want everything under the sun.
So make sure you know who your customer is, who is your bread and butter is and
start delivering the technology that they want.
Technomic did a survey last year where 81% of the people surveyed, I think it was
about a 1,000 consumers, restaurant goers need food service on a daily basis,
breakfast, lunch, dinner or whatever. And that 43% of them said, tech is really
important to make that food service convenient. So that's a big number, and it is an
important part of our restaurants business. I don't think anyone is denying that. But I
think it's time, especially if these cost savings really are happening or these tax
savings are happening to dive in. I will note that I didn't talk about delivery at all
because I honestly don't consider that really tech. I consider that, you got to ﬁgure
that operationally and then get up their party. So happy to talk delivery if all is
needed, but I wanted to kind of get into some of the other nitty-gritty more tech
investments, but hope that was helpful.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-01

Michael HalenYeah. No, I think this was really great. And I think if anybody has any questions, if they
want to send that in, I know we have a couple here on the docket. Let me go ahead
and check that. There is some question speciﬁcally, and I think we covered this, Gary,
just how the new rules on 179 impact speciﬁcally new construction if at all. I think we
kind of covered that. I didn't know if you wanted to highlight anything speciﬁc on
that. Yeah. No, I didn't know. And then we have one just about on kiosks making a
diﬀerence.
Gary, let me grab one question real quick. So there is a question about kiosks
making a diﬀerence for chains. If you want to shoot me a note, I can get used to
(Technical Diﬃculty) data. And Michael, you might have some chain speciﬁc
reference. I know what's happening is, I believe McDonnell has been really happy
with the performance of its kiosks, which is why they are accelerating the re-imaging
and the use of the kiosks across the country. I don't have much more color on that.
Wendy's, when I spoke to them, but this is over a year ago, kind of like, some people
don't know how to use it. I believe they are making a huge diﬀerence. I don't have
anything like actual data behind this.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yeah. In our world, in the public chain world, the companies that have them installed
or in the process of installing them like McDonald's are seeing a signiﬁcant bump.
Management teams are talking to the signiﬁcant sales bump that they're getting in
QSR. On casual dining, we're not seeing a bump. That's come and gone. So a few
years ago Brinker got a boost for about a year, probably helped them by about 200
basis points. But since then, it's almost like a cost of doing business for some of
these casual dining chains or the truck families.
Okay. And I guess shifting just on the chains of like fast casual, do you see any sort of
diﬀerence on their --
I found that data point still interesting, that people are interested in looking at
automation in fast casual, because I guess that some of the examples are maybe
Wow Bao, Chicago, honeygrow. I don't have the details on the performance of that.
So I apologize for that, but I feel like it is really new. I think the only one's we're
hearing from are the big public QSR chains.
All right.
