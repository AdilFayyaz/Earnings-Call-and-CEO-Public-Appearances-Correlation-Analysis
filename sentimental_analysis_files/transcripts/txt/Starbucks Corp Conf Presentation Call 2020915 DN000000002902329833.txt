Presentation
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Hi. It's John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Thank you everyone for joining the Starbucks
session here this morning. Joining with Starbucks is Pat Grismer, the company's
Chief Financial Oﬃcer, who I believe will start us oﬀ with some slides.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Thank you very much, John. I do appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's
session. Before we do get start oﬀ with our ﬁreside chat, I do want to provide a quick
update on our sales recovery in our two lead growth markets, US and China. So I'm
going to ﬁrst share my screen. So if you'll bear with me, that's set up here. (inaudible)
you can see the slides. I will be speaking to these slides that will soon be posted to
our Investor Relations website. So I'll lead with our standard cautionary language as I
will be making some forward-looking statements.
So starting with the US, our sales recovery is sustained with comp sales improving
from minus 14% in July to minus 11% in August, on track to achieve positive comps by
the end of our ﬁscal second quarter in 2021, as we previously out-looked. If noted, at
the bottom of the slide, some two-year comps to normalize for some variability in
prior year lap. The recovery, as you can see, is unfolding fairly steadily. Worth noting
that now more than half of our stores in the US have at least limited seating available
and we've seen that as we've progressively opened our ordering and sales channels
from drive-through to entryway pickup to in-store ordering and seating comps have
improved and they're continuing on that path.
Looking ahead, we expect three key initiatives will fuel our future recovery in the US;
ﬁrst, the deployment of handheld (inaudible) of the drive-thru; second, the roll-out
of curbside pickup where we have convenient parking; and third, today the launch
of Stars for Everyone. We are very pleased with the upward momentum in our US
business, but we still have ways to go to fully recover sales in the US. And the overall
operating environment remains somewhat uncertain. So prudently, we foreseeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

Patrick J. Grismeranother six months of recovery as previously outlook. But we're very pleased with
our progress thus far and we're very optimistic for the future.
So moving then to our second lead growth market, which is our business in China.
You can see that our business there is approaching full sales recovery. We posted ﬂat
comps in August, up from minus 10% in July. Those numbers include a 4-
percentage-point beneﬁt from a temporary VAT exemption. So it's also shown the
numbers without that temporary beneﬁt. We are still on track to achieve positive
comps, excluding the VAT beneﬁt, by the end of our ﬁscal Q1 in 2021, as we
previously outlook. Like the US, we've noted here at the bottom of the slide, two-year
comps, which show a steadier recovery and turned positive in August. Our future
recovery enablers in China include, number one, the accelerated development of
our convenience store format Starbucks Now; number two, increased digital
customer engagement, which has grown through ongoing improvements to our
digital platform, including the recent introduction of Starbucks Rewards multi-tier
redemption; and third, ongoing leverage of our digital partnership with Alibaba,
which includes delivery.
Now there are some headwinds to our full sales recovery in China. And those are
continuing lower levels of traﬃc at travel and transportation hubs as well as city
center locations that are impacted by reduced inbound international travel.
So I'm going to wrap up my opening remarks with some reminders about some
upcoming key dates. We are set to report our fourth quarter and full year earnings
on October 29, at which point we will also provide guidance for ﬁscal 2021. That will
be a 53-week ﬁscal year for Starbucks instead of the normal 52 weeks as happens
every ﬁve or six years. We will highlight the impact of the 53rd week when we do
provide guidance.
Looking further ahead, we will host our Biannual Investor Day on December 9, which
will obviously be conducted virtually. So I am going to now stop sharing my screen
here, which at the end of the slides. And John, at this stage, really happy to take your
questions.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you. So the August comp-oﬀ down 11 in the US. I assume, I can ask you
very speciﬁc question. How many stores of any are still closed? And could you tell
me, again, the percentage of stores that have limited seating? You said it was -- I
think, you said half of the stores have limited seating?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Yes. So, currently about 3% of our company-owned stores in the US remain closed.
Those are concentrated in central business districts in large metropolitan areas. And
yes, more than -- about 50% of our stores that are open do have some form of
seating.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

Patrick J. Grismer{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
And the stores, I guess, there 50% have seating, 57% of your stores have drive-thrus.
So I mean, would it be more likely that a drive-thru store would not have at seating
open? Or is that just really -- is that, a market like California, for example, is just kind
of suggest, of course, where I'm going to get is thus seating mean higher sales
performance?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Yes. In drive-thrus, more often than not, we do have seating available, which is
important, because there are customers who would prefer not to wait in a very long
drive-thru lines. They can come into the store place their order and collect their
order and be on their way or if they like they can sit and say where we have limited
seating available.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
With respect to the drive-thru locations, they're performing really well. They are
already comping positively. The cafes that are concentrated in our central business
districts, they're continuing to comp negative. Those that are open that as I
mentioned before, the large number of those remain closed. But all of that has
reﬂected in the improving sales comps that I have shared.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
And how do you deﬁne CBD urban oﬃce there have been a -- there could be a lot of
kind of cross deﬁnition here. But what percentage of your stores would you deﬁne as
CBD, which for obvious reasons take the longest to recover getting full mobility
that's subway traﬃc other things like that?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Yeah, the best way to think about it, as you mentioned before, about 60% of our
company-owned stores in the US are drive-thru, the remaining 40% are cafes. Of that
40%, about a third are in central business districts, not all of those are closed, but a
fair percentage are, and those represent the 3% of the total company-owned system
that remain closed at the moment. But you know what, I think it's important to
highlight is that through the pandemic we've seen customers changed their
behavior. So as increasing numbers of our customers are working from home, that's
why we have low levels of traﬃc in central business districts, but we are seeing very
signiﬁcant increases in customer traﬃc at our suburban drive-thrus. Customers have
changed their behaviors. They are eager to reestablish their routines and ﬁnd some
measure of normalcy. They're visiting Starbucks closer to home. They are tending toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

John W illiam Ivankoevisit a bit later in the day and they're spending more when they do come. So as
customers have modiﬁed their behavior, we've adapted to accommodate them.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Thank you. So again, this is very quick math. So 60% of your drive-thru stores are
positive -- 60% of your stores are drive-thrus, and that cohort is positive, negative,
more speciﬁcally. That would suggest something like comps are down somewhere
like 25%, maybe more for the non-drive-thru stores. I mean, is that kind of what are
your expectations? At this point, no recovery. And is it -- I'm using word self-help, but
I mean lack of better word. Is there anything that you can do to kind of pull --
basically, pull up that lagging cohort that you feel that is within your control that
bodes to basically the government -- government kind of opening, people just
getting back to work.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Here's how we think about it. There will be a cohort that will for some period of time
the under pressure until the environment normalizes. We don't know when that will
be. We're not waiting for that. And so we are rapidly innovating in order to capture
new demand, new occasions that we didn't have before that tied to how customers
are currently living their lives, which is why we have moved quickly to open up new
channels of distribution at our existing stores, primarily in the suburbs because there
is signiﬁcant latent demand and there is unmet demand. And so as we've seen
customers change their behavior patterns, we've moved swiftly in order to capitalize
on that, recognizing that for a cohort of our stores at may be some time before we
see volumes turn to where they were before. And we're not waiting around for that.
And then also, as we mentioned back in June, some stores in central business
districts that were already lagging in their performance, in the current environment,
just aren't going to deliver a level of performance that will warrant maintaining those
operations. And so many of those stores perform part of the roughly 400 stores that
we said we would accelerate a closure on in the next 12 to 18 months, and that
process has started. So we are rapidly shifting our business in response to shifting
customer behavior in the near term. And for the long term and, of course, another
important part of that is the rapid innovation around our convenient retail store
format, which is the Starbucks Pickup store where we're looking to accelerate the
pace of development in the coming year. And that will be focused in these urban
centers.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean there is a letter that was sent to landlords just basically get in time.
Yeah, Starbucks is obviously big tenant, but you're not getting the walk by traﬃc that
tiny traﬃc -- what have you that that a lot of stores would have contemplated when
you sign these leases. Are you having success in that 40% of non-drive others just
assume that's the case? The 40% of non-drive-thrus or maybe that one-third of CBD
is a 40% of kind of getting signiﬁcant rent reductions. I'm sure when a landlord say,
when you talk -- when Starbucks leads a street, that the value that street goes down. I
mean our landlords kind of recognizing that you are giving you the kind of termsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

John W illiam Ivankoe
Patrick J. Grismerthat basically make a marginal decision one in fact that you will stay because they
appreciate that you add value to everyone around you?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, John, you're absolutely right. We've recognized the strength in the power of
our brand and a prominent position that we have in retail. And so we are seeing
success in those conversations with landlords. But it's not necessarily in the way that
you might expect, or that you've alluded to, i.e., we're not seeing short-term rent
abatement. What we are seeing is more favorable terms for existing locations and
importantly for new locations because remember we're still growing. Even though
we're accelerating closure of stores, we have a very robust new store development
program focused on our drive-thru assets largely in the suburbs, and we're able to
bring to bear the current environment to secure favorable rent terms or lease terms
for those new locations, as well as for, again, existing. So to give you some examples
of the types of concessions we're seeing, we are securing additional parking spots.
That's a very signiﬁcant because in fact we see curbside pickup as an important
enabler, as I mentioned, before of our longer-term recovery. Already we're in about
800 stores with curbside pickup. We will more than double that number in the next
couple of months. We're also securing early termination rights in our new leases,
which is important, because circumstances as we've learned can change, and we
need to have the ﬂexibility to exit as the situation warrants. And then ﬁnally, we are
also writing into our current leases, and new leases, provisions for rent relief in the
event of new disruptions comparable to what we've experienced in the last several
months. We can have that in our leases before. So I think we've been able to
capitalize on the current environment in a way that is very helpful to our current
operations and to our future operations, but not necessarily in the form of rent
abatement per se.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Okay. Yes. Thank you. I wanted to recap -- ﬂipping back and worth my note -- this
conversation is great, by the way. I didn't -- I mean, I don't know were you going to
be able to get such speciﬁc detail. Let's see -- sorry about this. The three initiatives in
the US, handheld point sale curbside -- and sorry for everyone. So let's focus ﬁrst on
the handheld point sale. Is that something that standing in the drive-thru? Is that --
there is an additional percentage of work kind of explain what that is and how much
of -- I mean, of the theoretical throughput enhancer that could have been the force
being whether it is that all whether type of (inaudible) or is like -- just kind of like the
practical solution across your store base?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So all great questions, John. We are currently in the process of reﬁning our model for
handheld POS. So we're currently piloting and reﬁning our model through the
testing that we're doing, so that we can rapidly deploy this. Absolutely, we expect
this to be a game changer for us in drive-thru. Bearing in mind that when Starbucks
was ﬁrst launched as a concept, that was not designed for drive-thru. We added
drive-thrus consumers who are looking for more convenience. But the fact is thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

Patrick J. Grismergiven the proﬁle of our menu with beverages, they're hand-crafted to customers,
individual speciﬁcations, down to how many pumps of syrup they want? How much
ice they want? What kind of milk they want? Is a pivoting to plant-based milk, and
we're able to provide that to them. But given the complexity we build, the wait times
in the drive-thru line can be long. The other thing we've seen is that with how
customers have changed their behavior in this pandemic, as I mentioned before,
we're seeing tremendous demand at our drive-thrus in the suburbs, because people
are working from home, they're taking a break in the morning, maybe in the
afternoon, again, they're bringing the family with them. We have a signiﬁcant
increase in the average order size. And with that, very high-ticket growth. And you
saw that in our third quarter results. We're continuing to see that. We do expect that
that will moderate over time, but that does put pressure on the drive-thru
experience. And so we see handheld POS as an opportunity to collect orders sooner
in the line, so that we can start the production of those handcrafted beverages and
be prepared to fulﬁll those orders more quickly than we are today. And we know
from our experience because we do measure this that when we improved drive-thru
time, we reduce bulking, we reduce line rejection. So we're better able to capture
the demand that is out of the last thing we want to have happened is someone drive
up to Starbucks see a long line and continue on their way. That's another reason why
curbside pickup is so important, because it provides customers another option. I
don't want to give them the drive-thru as place my order via my mobile phone, I can
conveniently pull into a parking spot that is designated for paid oﬀ [ph], and
partners will bring my order out to me. That is working beautifully. That's taking
pressure oﬀ the drive-thru, and it's accommodating more of that customer demand.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Yeah. And ironically, I mean, we think we have drive-thrus is probably where you
could most likely have curbside. So it's like --
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
That's correct.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
And this is the thing is -- and so it really does that -- and so it is going to go 1,600
stores curbside, we're going to 1,600 stores relatively soon. And do you have --
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
It will go to about 2,000, John. Excuse me.

to give the team a lot of credit. They're moving very rapidly, adapting to customer
behaviors, rapidly innovating and deploying our tremendous discipline and urgency.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Okay. And we -- and that's -- 2,000 is a huge accomplishment in such a short amount
of time. How many could have it in your opinion? Have you guys going through this
site-by-site on that?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
I mean, it's early to say. So in the near term, we can see our way to 2,000. A lot of it
has to do with the real estate and where are you actually situated and the viability of
having convenient parking spaces.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Yeah. Deﬁnitely. Okay. I mean -- I think handheld, I mean, again, this is in my opinion,
I wondered have you started like how AAA, for example, you does handheld. I mean
they can -- they don't have just one person doing it. There is somebody that is like
acknowledging you quarter, but you actually pay and it's -- and you can kind of do a
lot of those things and then they kind of -- and I don't know how much your capacity
--geographic capacity went up with (inaudible) P&L, but you can see it how much
faster it is. I don't know if that's -- kind of you benchmark or is it fairly talked about
everyone on the call.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Yeah, John, our team has gone to school on everybody in the category to learn best
practices and rapidly apply them, of course, we have a very complex technology
stack that includes our loyalty program and today we're launching Stars for
Everyone. So we have to be very careful, thoughtful, and deliberate about how we
introduce even more complexity. That stacks to ensure that we execute with
excellence both for our partners as well as our customers.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Do you think Star -- Stars for Everyone an enhancing where do you think that's a
potential game changer?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
It is a game changer. That's how I think about it, because as we have researched
ways of capitalizing on the enormous success of our Starbucks Rewards program,
time and again what is surfaced in our consumer research is that the number one
point of friction what prevents customers who love Starbucks from joining the
program is the requirement to pre-pay on a stored value for. So with Stars forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

Patrick J. GrismerEveryone, we are removing that barrier. And now all come customers who use their
mobile phone to place orders who register as a member of Starbucks Rewards and
register a credit card or a debit card can pay with that credit card or debit card not a
store value card and earn stars. Now as you would expect, the stars earning rate is
lower. So the current program with the stored value card is 2 stars per dollar, with
Stars for Everyone, it's one star per dollar, but it's lower than the levels and it
provides customers with a way of accessing value that we know is quite important.
And we do expect, as we've observed with Starbucks Rewards, previously, that when
customers make the move. And we're able to build that relationship with them and
bring to bear our personalized marketing, their frequency increases and their
average spend increases. And frankly what I think it's going to happen in the case of
Stars for Everyone is that once customers become accustomed to how it facilitates
their overall experience, many will choose to migrate and move to the existing. They
can earn 2x.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Yes. Exactly. When there is like what -- yes, yeah, deﬁnitely. And so that -- it's still is
credit-debit base, it's not the cash is not an option? Or did I misunderstand that?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
I don't know. I believe cash still is an option. So you can -- the way that app has been
designed, at the time you place the order, you can select your tender, which would
include a registered debit or credit card or you can indicate cash and scan at the
register is how I understand it works.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Yeah. Okay. Yes. And again, maybe in that -- some percentage of our customers see
it every day you pay with cash. I mean, have you released -- do you say what that
number is, the percentage of your peers, actually there are some currency?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
I don't know that we've released that before, John.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Okay. Yeah, I know. But it's not a small number. I mean, I think, in eﬀorts and by
deﬁnition -- by deﬁnition you couldn't have a car before because that's where at
least have it on the phone. Okay.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
John, what I would say is that the overriding insight underpinning continued
enhancements to our Starbucks Rewards Loyalty Program, whether in the US or in
China, it's ﬂexibility, because remember last year, we introduced multi-tierFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

John W illiam Ivankoe
Patrick J. Grismerredemption here in the US, we launched that in the start of the summer in China and
that provides customers so much more ﬂexibility in terms of how they can earn and
use their rewards. And that has contributed to increase spend with our rewards
numbers. The other thing I want to highlight, because I know this question came up,
but I think you may have asked the question on our last earnings call is in relation to
our 90-day active rewards members. And just see, over the course of the pandemic,
that number come down. It had been, I think at $18.7 million at the beginning of the
pandemic. And then at the end of our third quarter, it dropped down to I think 16,
just over 16.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Yeah, we have the tables in that room.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Yeah. So at the end of August, it was back about $18 million. So very quickly, as we
reopen for business as we've opened new channels of distribution, we've been able
to rebuild our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards member base and we expect that
upward momentum to continue now with a new catalyst Stars for Everyone.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Yeah. Interesting. And in terms of communicating these changes -- a couple of
things. I mean, Starbucks use some traditional media, I mean, your marketing spend
over the course of 25 years has gone up and you obviously had a lot of beneﬁts from
that going up Starbucks. They used to have even a deal until there is now obviously it
is. What is kind of your attitude towards traditional and digital media or our in-taking,
this is basically an opportunity to kind of rethink all of your marketing spend and
then every dollar we earned if you will?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, I think our marketing team does an extraordinary job of ensuring that our
money has spent as eﬃciently as possible. And of course, it is the strength of our
Starbucks Rewards loyalty program that provides us with the opportunity to be, I
would say, more eﬃcient than a lot of others within our category. That and our brand
stature -- our brand naturally attracts a lot of attention, a lot of promotions of various
channels. When we have new news around new product launches or new program
launches like Stars for Everyone, that attracts a lot of media attention. And that's why
when you look at the construct of our P&L, our marketing spend is about 1% whereas
others in the category are in the mid-single digits. And we see the opportunity to
continue to realize eﬃciencies, not only for our loyalty program-oriented marketing,
which includes the personalized marketing that we do as we build these
relationships with our customers, but also through social media and traditional
media. We've an opportunity to continue to revisit our programs to ensure that those
marketing dollars are spent as eﬃciently as possible. But we are not backing away, in
other words, we're not looking to spend less, we're looking to -- can you just spendFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

the most eﬀective and eﬃcient way possible.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Thank you for that. Before just in that 30 seconds we have before the call, you kind of
pointed out that you're wearing a Pumpkin Spice Lattes sweater. I kind of those
Lattes by Starbucks Florida comp, Miami comp. How important or these products?
Pumpkin Spice something that -- is it the gift that that's continuing to give -- just the
time to launch new products? How important still obviously the Impossible sandwich
that you have. The opening of Starbucks is very much of Moody's product driven
brand many brands that signiﬁcantly cut back their menu oﬀerings. I am not -- I think
you've only added. So just talk about the importance of new products in the place
within that in an environment that still is very changed and when diﬃcult to operate?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Yeah, well, I think, for Starbucks, new product innovation continues to be very
important to how we create excitement for both new and existing customers to drive
visitation. But at the same time, there is no substitute for the return of a fan favorite.
So yes, I am wearing my Pumpkin colored sweater today in honor of the fall. The fact
that this is Pumpkin Spice season and how excited I am about our re-launch at the
end of August of our Pumpkin Spice Lattes. And my own personal favorite the
pumpkin cream cold brew. I think it just goes to show you that in the current
environment, customers are looking for a taste of something familiar -- something
that helps them feel that they return to a sense of normalcy. And that's what
Starbucks as a brand represents for many customers and that's what of a product like
Pumpkin Spice represents for so many of our customers as well. And so we could not
be more delighted with how we're able to leverage these signiﬁcant assets that are
unique to Starbucks in ways that help to continue our recovery and underpin our
optimism around full recovery of the business.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
That's okay.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
I do want to come back quickly to the numbers because I have them now here in
front of me. At the end of 2Q versus Q4, our Starbucks Rewards at the end of our
ﬁscal Q2, we were at $19.4 million, 90-day actives in the US, at the end of Q3 that has
dropped to $16.3 million. And at the end of August, we were at $18.7 million. So, not
quite to the $19.4 million pre-pandemic, but you can see how quickly our Starbucks
Rewards customers have come back and we're seeing healthy numbers of 90-day
actives. And like I said, today's launch of the Stars for Everyone is going to take that
to a new level and we could not be more excited about that.

Patrick J. GrismerIn the markets that had been reopened the longest in Georgia, in North Florida what
have you, Tennessee, for example, are these markets performing signiﬁcantly ahead
of kind of the markets that like Michigan, that's still been relatively. So, I mean, what
kind of new market, yeah, obviously, understand the CBDs, that we can kind of form
outside of that. But is the market that's have been the longest performing the best, I
mean, these are the markets that have been open the longest, the consumers had a
lot more choice and new people are asking "more normally and aren't necessarily in
the dry fuel line with 20 other cars". This is kind of a lot of things. So it's been -- that
would be kind of an interesting dynamic to understand.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Yeah, John. So here's how I would talk about it. We have the ability to dial-up and
dial back our operations. Based on prevailing conditions in every one of the markets
where we operate. And we have seen through this pandemic in cases like California,
Texas and Florida where there were ﬂare-ups in the beginning of middle of the
summer where measures were taken that reduced traﬃc, we dialed back our
operating protocols. But then as conditions improved, we dialed back up. And what I
mean by dialing up and dialing back is what I mentioned by way of these
progressive orders of sales. So from drive-thru to entryway pickup to curbside, to in-
store ordering, sit and stay. And as we make our way across that spectrum,
regardless of the market, we see sales improve because we're able to accommodate
more customers for the type of experience they're looking to have. So it's more a
function of what those prevailing conditions are. They can go up and down. And
importantly, we have a new level of resilience that allows us to dial-up and dial back
our operations as needed. And that choppiness and performance across the markets
is embedded in the numbers that I shared in terms of how we progress from July to
August and as I mentioned the positive momentum continues.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Yeah. Very interesting. You obviously, a labor is the biggest cost that -- at the store
level, you're mentioning, dialing-up and dialing-down for dialing-down baseline on
various factors that you mentioned. It -- has the labor model changed in any way at
Starbucks? Obviously, you've been very focused on when you're drive-thru only
either you could even comment to a store. Obviously, that's a very diﬀerent labor
model that you will be able to come into the store where and it's a diﬀerent labor
model then having a cafe model where people are sitting down. So how do you
anticipate labor model potentially permanently changing? It should be, see, for
example, labor hours been lower on a given level of sales based on some learnings
that you had from COVID. How signiﬁcant could that be to your business?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Not signiﬁcant on the labor side. And that's not to say that we are continuing to ﬁnd
ways to be more eﬃcient. We're continuing to automate tasks where we can. We're
continuing to apply best practices to improve the eﬃciency of our operation. As I
mentioned before, we're looking to unlock capacity of the drive-thru. But through
the pandemic, we've had to add labor in areas like cleaning, and with the roll-out ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

done very smartly in a way that ensures we get a return on that investment. But given
the complexity of our menu that goes with oﬀering on handcrafted beverages that
are customized to the speciﬁcations of each and every customer, we don't have the
ability, like I think some others in our category, who are looking at opportunities to
simplify and rationalize their menu because they can -- we oﬀer personalization,
which drives a lot many complexity that is a source of competitive advantage,
because we're the only one who can do it at scale backed by loyalty program that
keeps people coming back once they found their favorites. So we're not going to
walk away from that. We do expect that we will get back to our pre-COVID eﬃciency
over also -- we will ﬁnd some eﬃciency opportunities. Those would be oﬀset with
new investments around opening up some of these channels, as I mentioned, but
also our commitment to our partnership the long term and continuing to invest in
their development in the near growth and we are planning for investments like that
in ﬁscal 2021.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Do you need to get back to previous '80s even higher 80s to get back to previous
store level proﬁtability?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Yes, we do.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So that's why John, what we said on the Q3 call was that -- and I'll just focus on the
US business for a minute, but of course we have a whole global business.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
And we are ﬂying, we have so much to cover. I know.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So speaking of the US business, we said that we will recover sales anyway return
positive by the end of our ﬁscal second quarter and that margin recovery would lag
by a couple of quarters. That's the reasons I mentioned which is that we're investing
in new areas and new channels to open up sales and we're making new investments
in partners, environmental sustainability, technology, all those things that are
important to our brand that diﬀerentiate us from the competition, we have never
been shy about diluting margin in order to unlock long-term growth and that
continues to be how we think about the business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

Patrick J. Grismer{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Yes. Understood. So let's shift to China, I don't know how you guys were so close
even back in January, February to kind of like predict recoverability and China
comps. I know there is a little bit a lot for this, absolutely genius and through -- you're
getting so close to ﬂat by the end of the ﬁscal year. So that's a very hard target to
come as place to as you did. So obviously congratulations there.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
I'll oﬀer just a bit of insight on that. At the time we put together that projection, it was
based on what we experienced with SARS nearly 20 years ago. So we did have
experience in market with a decent number of stores that gave us some visibility to
how the market might evolve and eventually recover in response to a major
disruption like a pandemic.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
And in your own experience, your China experience with probably could diﬀer that. I
mean, you just said you want you can probably add a view --I think few
understanding of the customer and how they can kind of get back and transfer
(inaudible). So anyway that amazingly well guided. So what's the opportunity from
here? So excluding that China is down 4% in August, the trend is -- I mean, if I broke
that down correctly. I mean -- this is -- the trend is obviously improving signiﬁcantly.
When did these numbers kind of the -- you give come deﬁnitively positive as -- I
want to talk about the state of competition. I mean, obviously, cost is kind of in the
market, locking, I don't know if you want to talk about directly is like this was like to
the biggest threat to you than obviously was it where it was supposed to be. So there
is obviously some things have there. How is the competitive environment changed in
China? And that does this actually open or expand or why you were -- your market
opportunity relative to what you would have thought even 12 months ago based on
what you had achieved?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So let's ﬁrst talk about the Starbucks business in China, and then we'll talk about
competition. We could not be more pleased with how our business has recovered in
China from a comp sales perspective, but then also importantly in terms of how
quickly the team was able to reinvigorate our new store development program. After
new store development on-hold for a period of six weeks or so, they very rapidly
ramped back up, and so we do expect to open more than 500 units this ﬁscal year
which is quite a monumental achievement. And as I mentioned before, the team is
not only opening units with steep, but they're doing it with innovation, with new
formats, including Starbucks Now and other innovative designs that continue to
capture the interest of Chinese customers. And we're using that as a vehicle to not
only drive traﬃc with existing customers, but to welcome new customers to the
brand because as we open new stores, we're not doing it just in existing cities, but
we're entering new cities. And so, we're using our development program as a
platform to broaden the reach of the Starbucks brand in the world's fastest growingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

are and how well the team is executing locally in terms of recovering comp sales and
driving new unit development.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
And could you give us an update, I mean, I know, 80% of transactions are actually
consumed on premise in China. We now double the top up for. Could you manage
what percent of the stores are at full capacity whether it's just the number of seats or
where the number of operating hours and if that 80% is still holding through?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, John, I think the important thing, and I know you're aware of this because
you've studied the market for years. China is a dynamic market. It is by no means a
static market. And so as COVID has impact of the market, customers have changed,
they changed their behaviors. They have sought out experiences that are
contactless. They were already very digitally savvy. They're leaning increasingly into
the digital platforms and we are evolving our oﬀerings to meet their demand. So
contactless is number one. Number two is convenience, which speaks to, again, the
slight pivot in our development program, continuing to open core stores with a
beautiful seeing areas to satisfy that type of occasions, but being there in a diﬀerent
format to satisfy a diﬀerent occasion, sometimes for the same customer, but
oftentimes, a new customer. And so I think it is more about the fact that the market is
dynamic. It is changing in response to COVID, and we are changing as a business in
response to those new customer behaviors and preferences. Digital being, I would
say the most important thing.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Yes. So maybe 80% of transactions were no longer consumer products. I don't think
you didn't give me a number, but I would assume that number is lower than it was
that. What percentage of your stores are kind of at full capacity now? Is that number
approaching 100 in China? I think it was 70, if I remember correctly?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
What I would say, John, is that we are far from full capacity because remember the
business in China is diﬀerent from the US. It isn't concentrated in the morning day
part as it has been in the US. It's more (Multiple Speakers).
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Yeah, I missed to ask a question. But it maybe seating and hours. I mean seating and
hours been return. I think it was at 70% of your stores before we were at previous
seating and previous hours. So not utilization, but that may -- I didn't ask the
question correctly?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

I'm sorry. I think we have about one stores that are -- 1% of our stores that are
currently those that are opened are substantially meaning more than 80% back to
normal seating. So we are operating at that full capacity.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
And it is remarkable. I mean, it's just -- it's like being in a parallel universe to see in
China that could be 80% stores have full seating, and you have -- in the US, to talk
about 15 even the sort of have capacity we're not like they were before. So what can
we learn from China and the US and when -- I mean, I don't know, we get -- it sounds
like you've a very speciﬁc understanding about this virus. When can that be the US in
your opinion? And you know, it can be US consumer follow basically your pattern.
And what is in much were dense country. And it can be ironically enough that maybe
does that there's a lot of confusing things about China has recovered so much and
we're still have kind of not the (inaudible) but you know we still have the need to
improvements as so many other countries have?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Yeah, I think it's fair to say that we won't see customers return entirely to their
routines and so there is a vaccine. We're not waiting for that. And so what we've
recognized is that we have needed to rapidly adapt our operating protocols to make
our partners feel safe and secure to come into work and to make our customers feel
safe and secure to come see us. And they are coming back. So I think what we're
seeing is that people are feeling more comfortable because appropriate cautions
have been taken to ensure the safety and cleanliness of the experience that we oﬀer.
And it just demonstrates how customers are yearning for that taste of normalcy that
comes with the Pumpkin Spice (inaudible) right? And we need to be there in support
of the communities because we're an important -- we see ourselves as being an
important part of that healing process.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
And perhaps -- as unfortunately we're somehow calling out on 40 minutes. Can we
talk about the organization how Starbucks is actually a strong organization, how we
can take advantage of your market share. I mean where the share of investments
have been in technology and infrastructure and people just like -- what you cut what
you've maintained. And how does -- speaking in terms of the organization and some
of the changes that you made on cylo. I think some of the changes that Kevin
underrated by the market in terms of how signiﬁcant that they were. It's kind of how
you perceive Starbucks in '21 and '22 versus you may give the organization that you
joined?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}

been instrumental to the, I would say, the turnaround of the business prior to theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

the strength of our recovery. And so what I would highlight is that so we're in this
transformation over the last two years, again, leading up to COVID. We've become a
much more focused company, a much more disciplined company, a company with a
higher level of organizational agility that has enabled us to innovate more rapidly.
And now with the improvements we've made to our operations to COVID, we are a
more resilient company. And so all of those things were very deliberate over the last
couple of years on top of the speciﬁc business initiatives to drive diﬀerent results was
sort of a transformation of the company. It is now given us new capability. And I think
a new mindset that is demonstrated through how rapidly and smartly we've been
able to recover our business and underpins the optimism we have about the future.
