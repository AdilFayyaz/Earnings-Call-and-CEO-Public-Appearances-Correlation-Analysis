{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Good morning, everybody. I'm Hans Mosesmann. I cover semis for Raymond James.
I'm delighted to have Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Oﬃcer of NVIDIA. And we're going to have a ﬁreside chat. And Colette, thank you.
Now NVIDIA is one of those stories that has transformed over the past several years.
There's still a fair amount of confusion. Maybe for our audience it would be helpful
to give a little bit of the history of NVIDIA and how over the past several years that
transformation has made it into a very, very intriguing story.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
That's great. So NVIDIA, NVIDIA is the leader in visual computing 20 years and
continuing our leadership position in there. But our focus has overall changed in the
last ﬁve years.
Our focus for the ﬁrst probably 15 years was focused on the overall PC platform and
providing the best graphics across all diﬀerent types of PCs. But we saw an
opportunity to better leverage our overall technology across four key specialized
markets and focus not on an overall chip or component of an underlying PC or other
type of device but really focus on a platform approach, a platform approach that
focuses on the best technology and innovations at the hardware level, also focuses
on a development layer, a development layer that's both programmable as well as
developer tools but also a key software component for many of these markets.
Now the four markets that we're focused on right now is gaming, primarily PC
gaming; number two, Pro visualization which talks about graphics for the overall
enterprise; data center, data center including high performance computing, artiﬁcialFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-07

Colette Kressintelligence as well as cloud graphics; and number four, automotive. And two key
pieces of automotive, both infotainment centers but also autonomous driving going
forward.
So a lot of discussion in terms of, wow, those are four very, very diﬀerent markets,
how can the exact same technology be leveraged across there? But we've really
been able to unify that overall investment and architecture across them and really
focus on the go-to-markets for each one of those.
So our success, we just ﬁnished our ﬁscal year at the end of January and that year
produced 7% growth in terms of on the top line and reaching record revenue levels
of $5 billion. In the Fourth Quarter alone each one of those four markets grew both
year over year as well as sequentially in this market. And when you strip out just
those four markets platforms that we're focused on that represents now more than
85% of our revenue and the growth of those four markets alone is more than 25%
and has been for the last two years.
We've continued to also grow overall gross margins. Our gross margins reached
record levels in both ﬁscal year 2016 as well as in the Fourth Quarter and now over
26, approaching 27 -- I'm sorry, approaching 56%, 57% and our overall operating
margins increasing over this last year as well as for the last two years growing more
than 400 basis points. So we're very pleased about the results that we've seen across
this transformational event.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Okay, let's delve down into some of these growth vectors. I get a lot of questions on
the gaming side speciﬁcally with virtual reality. What's the timing, what's the
hardware conﬁgurations necessary to make this VR experience compelling and
what's the growth implications of this cycle or megacycle or what do we have here?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So our gaming platform right now represents more than about 50% of our
overall revenue size at the company. We've been growing quite successfully across
many diﬀerent drivers, drivers that are really inﬂuenced by the overall games that
reach the market.
Our ASPs have grown. Our overall units have grown, our overall number of gamers
entering this market have overall grown.
Virtual reality as we see it is just another bonus opportunity for us in this market to
expand gaming. The next generation of reality type of gaming is ahead of us. It's a
little unsure in terms of how fast it will grow in the very beginning but the exciting
part about it is the high-end gaming with virtual reality will require one of our high-
end platforms.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-07

the overall desktop that would be abling overall VR as well as some in terms of the
notebooks. We've actually come out with a set of notebooks and desktop GPUs that
we call VR ready.
So we can enable any type of consumer to know which types of GPUs would be
great for that overall experience. So we're excited about the opportunity. We do
think long term it's deﬁnitely a growth enabler but right now we look at it probably
just as a bonus for the year.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Okay, last year the GeForce, the gaming side of the business was up quite a bit. Is it
possible that there was a lot of pre-buying into the VR dynamics that we'll see this
year? And if so could there be a speed bump or an air pocket I should say this year?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, I'm sure there are cases where a gamer went to market with their three reasons
in terms of why to buy. And one of them was that I can justify or think about also the
VR experience coming forth. But I still think there is a tremendous opportunity for
future buying of our high-end cards but there deﬁnitely could be a possibility that
they could buy.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Okay. Any questions from the audience on the gaming side before I go into other
topics?
Questions And Answers
(technical diﬃculty) what creators of the VR content have you been dealing with or
have you not been dealing with the capabilities of (inaudible) without having to deal

{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So it's a good question.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Can you repeat the question?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So the question was regarding what do we do to actually enable VR. Yes we have a
great chip in terms of its performance, its ability in terms of its frame rate to enableFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-07
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 11Q - Hans Mosesmann
A - Colette Kressthat but what else do we work on?
Very similar to what we do right now in terms of working with software developers
worldwide in terms of upcoming games that is a multiyear process for future games
coming out that we enable additional features to work with those overall games,
features that better enable some of the hard aspects of graphics. Things such as hair,
smoke, water, ﬁre, those are very key design features that we work in terms of our
game works adding additional.
And even now with virtual reality, we've come up with technology that actually
improves the perception of the speed of that overall rendering, focusing on what is
directly in front of the eye and then rendering the overall peripheral part of that VR
experience. You'll continue to see us add more and more features for VR and we are
working with probably more than 100 and 150 diﬀerent startups, small; and medium-
size gaming developers on VR.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Okay, let's move on to the cloud data center part of the business. A lot of investors
don't realize that the fastest say supercomputers in the world view the combination
of processors and GPUs that are accelerators if you will and there's this trend within
the data center to use that kind of concept of heterogeneous computing to apply to
various new workloads and the topic of deep learning comes up quite a bit of late.
What is that, how does it play out for architectural designs going forward and how
does NVIDIA play in that space of deep learning?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So a data center is a very exciting market for us both today as well as going
forward. We had been a key component in high-performance computing for some
time where we've been working with key supercomputing arena as well as key
applications in that space to essentially do the parallel processing, moving
workloads oﬀ of just the CPU and levering the GPU which is also programmable to
speed up the overall application and use.
Supercomputing 2015 back in the fall was really a heightened discussion about the
use of accelerations. And we're now seeing in the top 500 supercomputers more
than 100 of them are using acceleration for that main reason in terms of the
improvement of the throughput of their overall applications in these data centers.
But you talked about the expansion and the excitement around deep learning and
what is deep learning. So deep learning application that has been coming out in a
lot of research as well as higher education focus. And the focus really on using a GPU
with deep known network training to train a set of data and information for better
use cases for consumer types of applications.
Let me give you some examples. What you see in terms of the amount of data on
video, images, voice recognition, voice translation, very, very key large data sets that
they are able to use a GPU as the coprocessor, in this case to better mine thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-07

A - Colette Kressinformation and serve up a set of instructions. Just by throwing the information at the
GPU and a lot of information at the GPU, millions and millions of diﬀerent data, it can
train itself in that application.
You're seeing this looked at as kind of the artiﬁcial intelligence of the year 2016 and
the focus on continuing to improve the computers, better performance and actual
human capabilities in terms of recognition. You'll see applications such as search be
very common using overall GPUs in this. So both with the overall hyperscale web
service providers has been a large focus of ours and application by application or
workload by workload they continue to roll out GPUs in these environments.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
And these are high-end GPUs, is that correct?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Absolutely. These are overall mission critical, server level GPUs in those
environments.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Okay. Segueing into the competitive dynamic. Intel recently acquired Altera,
presumably for their acceleration capabilities, to integrate that into their server
products, their other accelerator-type solutions, their custom chips.
How does NVIDIA and the graphic side of the competitive dynamic win that game?
Or is there an inherent advantage that you may have versus some of these other
solutions?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, Intel did approach the market in terms of acceleration in this last year with the
overall integration of their M&A for Altera. Altera is a diﬀerent form of acceleration
using FPGAs. FPGAs are deﬁnitely an opportunity but not necessarily in the same
manner of what we're seeing in terms of in the deep learning space.
FPGAs although we talk about being programmable are probably more
conﬁgurable as we have a full development language, development platform and
also very key libraries and things to help developers in the space of deep learning.
So FPGAs are at probably diﬀerent level of really coding more at the hardware level
where we're focused more of the high-level software and the ability to change that
algorithm quite quickly based on new information makes GPUs very helpful to work
with. The overall performance on GPUs is quite, quite high, quite higher in terms of
what we're seeing in terms of FPGAs.
So in summary, probably when we focus on our hyperscales and the works that we're
doing on deep learning we haven't seen FPGAs really been talked about in that area.
Mostly GPUs have been used in most of these environments.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-07

Okay. Any questions from the audience on data centers, deep learning? Okay, let's
move along.
Automotive. So if you would have asked me three, four years ago if NVIDIA would be
a key player in the automotive business I would've told you that you're crazy and I
don't (inaudible), right?
So what happened here? How all of a sudden does NVIDIA move at CES from the
gaming and the PC side of the ﬂoor to right between Mercedes and Audi? And why
don't you give us a little background on how this all happened, it's fascinating.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So we've actually been working with auto manufacturers for eight to 10 years. Our
focus today in terms of what drives our overall revenue size more than $300 million
and in this last year it actually grew close to 80%. But that's been a focus on
infotainment systems and center-consoles as well.
And those are in key cars such as Audi, BMW, all of the Teslas, Hondas in Europe,
Bentleys and all of some diﬀerent types of manufactures, where they are really, really
focused on changing the overall experience to the driver of a console which are
graphics that meet the overall needs of what they driver has been. But what you've
seen us talk about at CES for the last two years is our focus on taking exactly our
learnings from the data center and applying that to the overall automotive for
autonomous driving. Our focus is to supply the overall central computing platform or
essentially the supercomputing underlying that overall car for future autonomous
driving.
A little bit diﬀerent than the focus of ADAS or assisted driving in terms of what you
see today and a focus on a repository for all the diﬀerent information that may come
in through the car through cameras, lidar, radar, any types of sensors and processing
it exactly as we do the hyperscale data centers and with enough information
assisting that car to drive in the future. We're working right now with more than 50 to
70 diﬀerent auto manufacturers, Tier 1s and startups who are concentrating on
autonomous driving.
Autonomous driving as you look today, do a search on the web is probably one of
the more exciting areas of focus. And even in the last couple of years the speed of
the technology and those focusing on autonomous driving this will deﬁnitely be
something in the future of increased intensity.
And in intensity of how quickly can we move this technology to real cars that are on
the road. But our overall platform approach that we did with DRIVE PX and DRIVE
PX's focus on a scalable open platform that we're enabling to work with the
manufactures collectively on both that development platform and the software that's
going to be necessary to take this forward.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-07

Q - Hans Mosesmann{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Do you have competition in that, space autonomous driving?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I think there is a lot of interest in autonomous driving, a lot of diﬀerent forms of
technology. We haven't seen anybody approach it in the same manner of a
computing platform to be that central place for the overall car. There is a possibility
that others may join this but so far we seem to be the only provider right now on that
supercomputer approach.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Okay, the reason I ask is that it comes up quite a bit that you guys compete with
Mobileye or companies like that. And can you please compare and contrast what
your solution is which is like the supercomputer of the car and what some of these
other players may be doing?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. And kind of stemming in the discussion about there is ADAS, assisted driving or
assisting with signals and things to the overall driver, many of the companies today
are focused on computer vision for the car with overall smart camera approach and
providing a set of algorithms based on what they see to the driver in a system. Our
approach is a little bit diﬀerent. Instead of an add-on from the overall camera or a
sensor or a lidar is really talking about putting that all collectively together and we
will work with anything in the car.
So they can be complementary right now. You may see us together on some of this
but our focus is really the underlying computing platform, not a single piece of
ADAS.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Okay. Any questions on the automotive side? Eric?
I was wondering would you think that the car manufacturers you are currently
engaged with or the Tier 1s share that vision right now on the autonomous design
(inaudible) to determine what track of the (inaudible)
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I would say --

Can you repeat the question?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-07

A - Colette Kress{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
The question was the manufactures and/or the Tier 1s, are they centered on this
exact technology for autonomous driving going forward? Or is there still room for
technology diﬀerences as we go forward? And I think deﬁnitely there is a lot of focus
today on our approach in terms of those that we're working with.
Many of the startups that you've seen, many of the self-driving cars that you see right
now are leveraging a GPU technology to even gather the data and process the data
that they are doing. They have seen tremendous improvement in terms of the
throughput of how quickly they can reach in terms of algorithms with their software,
using the GPU. Very similar types of results in terms of the acceleration that you see
in the data center, that acceleration in the overall design process for the cars.
But the market is very open still. There's no anyone provider that will both deﬁne that
future going forward and we will probably work with a bunch of providers all the way
through this as we go forward. But we do see our platform as being very, very well
received with those that we're working with right now.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
One other question.
You mentioned the diﬀerence between the assisted driving approach and your
approach. (inaudible)
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So --
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
What's the diﬀerence between --
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
What's the diﬀerence between ADAS and that approach and our approach in terms
of the supercomputer. In many of the ADAS they will depending on the regions
some are focused on a camera approach. Some are focused on lidar or radar taking
in information around the car and serving a single function.
For example, letting people know when your car has moved outside of its lanes,
whether with a vibration and/or a light. So step-by-step telling a driver about things
that are going on around the car. But the driver is still driving.
So you're assisting the overall driver in the alertness of what is going on. Our
approach has been on an overall central computing we'll take information from
around the car all over and take the possibility of a sensor radar and/or a cameraFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-07
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 11Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Colette Kress
Q - Hans Mosesmann
A - Colette Kressand using that information together, not necessarily just from an identiﬁcation of
what is surrounding the car but how to process that information for the car to
actually move such that the driver is actually not driving.
The approach takes a with so much information and so much data on all of the
diﬀerent roads you can overall teach this computer to drive by itself and using that
overall deep learning application. So focus is not on silicon that may be behind
anyone of these outside sensors but really focus on the central computing to overall
get that job done.
So what you need for all these (inaudible) systems and then you take the data from
all the systems and apply it to --
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
It will take and can take information from all of these diﬀerent inputs as well as
probably new inputs that will be added into the car going forward, correct.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Okay, let's move forward. On the IP side you have a crosslicensing agreement that
ends soon with Intel. You have other monetization strategies on the legal front with
Samsung and Qualcomm.
How does that play out over time? How should we look at that on the IP
monetization side of the business going forward?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Our Intel licensing agreement is approaching ﬁve, six years and it does come
up for its end at the end of Q1 of our ﬁscal year 2018. We'll continue to follow this.
It's not sure if it will renew at that time and most of our thoughts on that is to say
we're ﬁne if the assumption is that people assume it's zero as our real focus is on our
four key market platforms. And so we've done those as business groups that we can
continue to grow and overall grow our operating margin.
And that's how we look at our overall IP, not necessarily as a business unit but a key
approach for us to both defend our IP and have people recognize that using our IP
or infringing on it without monetization is not what we'd like to see. So we took that
case for an example with Samsung against Samsung and Qualcomm and took them
to the ITC.
Now those cases haven't exactly moved in our right manner so far. But we'll continue
to see those through and approach anymore IP really as a business case, can we look
through and ensure that we will have the proﬁtability that we want to if we take any
more cases forward.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-03-07

Okay. On the M&A front then, what kinds of assets out there do you think you might
be interested in or is it at this point more organic now that you have everything
pretty much in place?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, I think we're deﬁnitely locked with our four platforms that we're working on and
it provides us tremendous opportunity and a TAM going forward for us to capture.
We will look at M&A but we've tended to focus on early stages or things that can add
to our existing platforms easily and incorporate those. So I think you'll see us focus
on that continuing going forward.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Okay. We have a few more minutes. And Colette if you can just let the audience
know and those that are listening on the webcast what is the most exciting aspect of
the next several years as you see it and as senior management looks at the
environment?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I think when we look forward we've been so dazzled with our overall performance in
this transformation to the 4Q market. But even when we think about the overall TAM
opportunities of them there is tremendous opportunity going forward as well.
What I think is also quite unique is when we think about some of the key disruptive
technologies that are in front of us, both virtual reality, deep learning and artiﬁcial
intelligence and autonomous driving going forward. We are underlying technology
across three disruptive technologies that will probably transform each of those
industries quite substantially. So we couldn't be more excited about our approach to
these markets with the platforms that we have and the technology that we're
bringing to market.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Okay, we have time for maybe one or two questions if there is any. Okay, kind of
quiet out there. All right, Colette, thank you very much.
