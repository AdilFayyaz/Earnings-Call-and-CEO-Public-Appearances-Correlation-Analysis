Hey, welcome to our next session. I'm really happy. Yes, Kirk Koenigsbauer from
Microsoft on. Very German in by the way, so I will be proud talking to you. Kirk, you
have like a very long career in Microsoft. And so it's -- there's so many diﬀerent areas
we can and should talk about and I'm looking forward to talking about. Maybe we
start with like a more broader question is, if you think about your time in Microsoft,
you saw many changes. But if you think about the last two years like when it comes
to what's going on there. How the pandemic has impacted all of there, like, how did
that impact you and the Microsoft team?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. Well, ﬁrst you make me sound old.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
But no, I mean I think the last couple of years is there's no question, it's been nothing
short of extraordinary. And how it's supercharged so much of digital transformation
in the industry. It's just amazing. I've been in this productivity and collaboration
space for a long time as you suggest and whether it's how people are creating and
innovating, marketing teams, sales teams, logistics teams, supply chain, supply chain
tough right now, as we all know, servicing customers, everything is just undergoing a
really massive shift. And it's been amazing to see.
I think from customers, what we're hearing pretty consistently, it's actually quite
consistent across the board, there are a couple of diﬀerent challenges. And I thinkFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-08

Page 2 of 12Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Kirk Koenigsbauerone is really around hybrid, which I'm sure you've been talking about and at the
conference and other places. But hybrid is a sort of going to be the new normal for
us. And the interesting thing that we hear and that we ﬁnd in our research. In fact, we
do this survey called the Work Trends report. And it's about 30,000 employees
across a bunch of diﬀerent industries globally, bunch of diﬀerent markets, big
companies, large companies, small companies, mid-size, the whole gamut.
And we found this really interesting paradox as we think about hybrid. On the one
hand, 70% of that population really love the ﬂexibility that remote work has provided.
And they want that in the future. They think that that's an important part of their job,
what they want to go do. But at the same time, these same people, 67% of them
actually want more in-person time for collaboration and for creation. So we talk
about this as a hybrid paradox. But it is the reality I think that we're all going to live,
and people are going to want the best of both worlds.
It's been two years doing this stuﬀ and people aren't going to want to go back to the
old ways. And so we're going to be in this sort of hybrid environment, for sure.
Another trend that I'm sure you're seeing too, is what we talk about as the great
reshuﬄe. Some people talk about as a great resignation. But I actually think it's a
little more accurate to talk about it as a great reshuﬄe, where there are lots and lots
of people that are sort of rethinking their place in the workforce, 41% of people that
we survey are considering leaving their current employers. And a similar percentage
are just thinking about doing something diﬀerent. And so there's just a massive
talent war that's going on, there's a massive refocus on the employee and the need
to develop employees and skill those employees, retain those employees. You're not
going to higher your way out of this problem that we face, and it's changing
leadership, it's changing a bunch of diﬀerent dimensions.
And then I guess I would say the last big trend that's pretty consistent across every
customer I talk to is security. Just the threat of phishing and ransomware, breach and
IP theft and all the stuﬀ insider compliance issues and so forth. With all the change
that's going on, companies are more than ever really worried about their security
platform. And how to protect from the endpoint right up through their cloud
platform and their infrastructure and all this stuﬀ. And it's a very interesting time
because it's so consistent across each of these dimensions, at least from what we're
seeing in the space.
Questions And Answers

(Question And Answer)
Yes, yes. And it must be fascinating for you because like you're like the overarching
umbrella, you were kind of touching all these actually in your job?

Page 3 of 12Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Kirk KoenigsbauerYes, it's a fun time to be in this part of the business for sure. No question. No
question.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes, yes. In all conversation I kind of want to touch on a good fuel of the points you
made already to go, dig a little bit deeper like, let's start maybe on the Microsoft 365
side like, you moved successfully to the cloud, I've been watching obviously as a
ﬁnancial analyst, I look at the numbers, I look at the number of people that are
converting or have converted, et cetera. How do you think about the opportunity for
further seat growth? Like I mean we're approaching now numbers, years ago you
would have said, yes, no that's it, that's converted. Now that you keep growing.
There's a lot of new areas coming as well. Like how do you think about that volume
growth?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. No question. Well, Microsoft 365 has been -- it's amazing the momentum that
we're seeing now. And as we've disclosed about 1/3 of our total Oﬃce 365 seats are
now sold through Microsoft 365. And so broadening this value proposition beyond
just sort of productivity and collaboration, to all the management stuﬀ that products
like EMS provide and so all the security oﬀerings that we provide. And then, of
course, the sort of Premium Windows experiences in the commercial piece. It's really
allowed us to sort of broaden the notion of what our cloud productivity and
collaboration service is. And it's kind of become this sort of de facto world
productivity cloud. And that's great.
In terms of your question, though, speciﬁcally, you're right, the sort of legacy or the
history of our franchise around sort of all things Oﬃce and now evolving obviously to
Microsoft 365, it's been largely centered on the information worker or the
knowledge worker. But that's really changing with Microsoft 365. We do see new
opportunities, new avenues to deliver these kinds of productivity and collaboration
experiences that are going to drive seat growth.
I think M365 is also an ARPU play, we can talk about that if you want to. But on the
seat side, there's a couple of diﬀerent vectors that I think are interesting. One that is
really frankly gotten a lot of recognition over the last two years kind of going back to
your ﬁrst question, which is around the notion of the front line or the ﬁrst line worker.
And this is a population of set of the employee base that has kind of been left
behind. These are your service professionals, your retail professionals, your
manufacturing shop ﬂoor professionals, your healthcare professionals, folks that
don't necessarily sit at a desk all day and sort of type away like a lot of us do.
They are on the ﬁrst line of everything, for sales, for service, for support, obviously,
transportation, safety, security, health. We've seen it over the course of the last two
years and how important that is to the economy. And that population has historically
been kind of left behind in terms of being connected to the rest of the workforce.
And so lots of CEOs, CIOs, business leaders that we talk to are interested in lighting
up and being able to connect that population to the rest of the employee base to be
able to lead with them and communicate and the mission alignment and all that. ButFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-08
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 12Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Kirk Koenigsbauerthat's also where a big chunk of digital transformation is happening sort of in every
one of these industries that I've been referencing. The ﬁrst line worker, the frontline
worker experience is really getting digitized in a massive way. And that's a big seat
growth driver for us.
The other -- another one that I think is pretty important to us, which we've talked
about in the past is the SMB space, the small mid-sized business base. But I would
sort of put a ﬁner point on the very small business opportunity. The sort of
solopreneur up to say 10, 20, 25 seats something along that line. That's a really -- we
feel like that's a really big opportunity for Microsoft 365 also. And we have created a
bunch of new SKUs over the course of the last few years with Microsoft 365 to put
the sort of power of the platform into the hands of small businesses, including these
really small businesses, and that's been a big opportunity for us.
In fact, just last week, we also announced a new SKU called Microsoft Teams
Essentials, which is essentially a product speciﬁcally designed for this small business
space, super competitive, $4 a month, all in one sort of meeting and conferencing
solution. We think that that's a big deal. I also personally get pretty excited about
security oﬀerings in the small business space. We can't forget that a lot of big
companies, that's where a lot of the focus is on ransomware and ﬁshing and all that
stuﬀ, but it's happening in the small business space, too. And frankly, they don't have
the tooling or the expertise at that level. They don't have big IT shops or partners
sort of supporting them on a day-to-day basis. So security is important there.
And then the last one I guess I would just say is around emerging markets. We
observed emerging markets, of course, at Microsoft broadly, but I would say our
focus has been largely on the large sort of organizations in any given emerging
market or developing market. And we think that there's a lot of opportunities sort of
in the breadth, the smaller organizations, those mid-size and SMBs again. And Teams
is really our vector and our avenue there because it just is changing the dynamic in
such a important way. So I don't know, we see a lot of opportunity with M365 to
drive seats going forward. And we've seen some good growth through both the
FLW, the ﬁrst line worker piece and the SMB space over the last couple of quarters.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes, no. Yes, exactly. And you mentioned ARPU already, that could be like, so we
have volume and have price both OEM, I remember I made a mistake few years ago,
I said, price increase and Amy kind of killed me on the call. So selling more value to
customers. The -- where are we on the diﬀerent SKUs there in terms of like adoption
and opportunity?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. Yes. Well, I think you're right to articulate it. I mean, Microsoft 365 has the
opportunity for seat growth, but also for ARPU growth as well. And I would say
originally, frankly, it was much more of an ARPU play initially because we were
converting these seats from on-prem or the basic Oﬃce 365 workloads to this
broader M365 suite. But we see quite a bit of headroom ahead of us. Right now we
just post this in the last couple of quarters, the E5 oﬀering that we have, think aboutFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-08

A - Kirk Koenigsbaueras our highest -- for folks who don't follow along, the minutiae of our SKUs. It is sort
of highest premium tier for Microsoft 365. And that right now is only 8% of our
installed base.
And so we feel like we've got a lot of upside there, whether it's I referenced security
brieﬂy in the SMB space. But a lot of organizations are looking to provide the kind of
security and compliance and identity solutions that are required today. There's a big
chunk of management value that's there, there's a big chunk of what we call a phone
system or modern ways to do sort of weight-based calling and PSTN-based calling.
And so we think that there's quite a bit of headroom left in this E5 space. I do think,
overall, there is a little bit of a balance, of course, as we drive more SKUs, right, more
seats and we'd raise ARPU it's -- we have to think about the balance on either side
there. But we see opportunity on both vectors.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
And the -- where are we on that, I seem to remember like a few quarters ago, you
talked about E3 as the heroes? Like is there still like E1 to E3 cover-ups?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. It's a little, it's a -- so we have a number of diﬀerent SKUs because we address
large organizations, large enterprises, mid-size companies and small businesses, we
have a host of diﬀerent SKUs. And we do use this sort of nomenclature of E1, E3, E5.
For some reason, we don't like, even numbers, I guess.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
But we have them for the enterprise SKUs. We have a set of SKUs for the SMB side.
And of course, we have a consumer business too with over 50 million subscribers.
But yes, the -- our objective, of course, is to penetrate into a market or a customer in
some way, whether it's with an E3 SKU or whatever and then sort of expand the
rooms of the house is sort of an analogy that we use internally to drive that higher
ARPU with more scenarios. Whether it's maybe they're starting oﬀ with just the basics
of productivity and collaboration, but then there's a really natural opportunity to
attach security on top of it or compliance on top of it or a phone system on top of it.
That's kind of a playbook.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. Okay. And then on the -- talk a little bit about the Windows franchise. It doesn't
get as much airtime anymore, which is kind of I think it's unfair because it's a very big
important product for you. What have you seen as you think about the pandemic
supply chain management constraints that are playing out there, like, what have
been your observations there?

Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 12Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Kirk Koenigsbauer
Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Kirk KoenigsbauerYes. No. For sure. Windows remains a huge anchor of growth for the company and
it's a super important way that we service our customers, attract new customers and
so forth. So we talk about it a lot internally and it's super important. The dynamics
related to your supply chain point are a little diﬀerent on the consumer side. You sort
of the -- we do see some supply chain impact. We see that show up sort of in the
OEM piece, of course, as you'd see that. On the commercial side, it's a little bit
diﬀerent. We're a little bit less dependent there because a lot of what's happening in
the commercial space is companies are buying their PCs and then they're upgrading
them to Microsoft 365, which includes the per user component in Windows. And so
there we see actually a really strong ARPU opportunity for Windows Commercial by
moving customers to Microsoft 365.
And there what customers are doing are not to sound like a broken record, but
going back to the same point again, they want Windows to be more secure. And so,
for example, we have this oﬀering called Microsoft Defender, which is essentially
endpoint security solution. That is part of Microsoft 365, part of Windows. And that's
one of the ways the customers are sort of upselling.
I mentioned management infrastructure is another big part of it. How do you
manage Windows? Frankly, multiple device types across this sort of in this new
hybrid world, where lots of people are remote. You've got to think about things like
virtualization, we have a new oﬀering called Windows 365, which is a virtualization
oﬀering, which we're really excited about, just came out recently. And then, of
course, there is the natural upgrade cycle of machines and we've seen lots of
organizations with the focus on employee experience, wanting to make sure that
their employees have good devices, so that they can get their job done. And so we
have beneﬁted from an upgrade cycle in the commercial space too. So we're bullish
on what we see in terms of Windows Commercial value going forward. We think it'll
continue to be a big growth driver for us.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. And it's funny like just to give you some feedback like, as I start going back to
the oﬃce, I just -- all of a sudden I discovered the ancient nature of my machine and
seem like there need to be an upgrade cycle there.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. For sure.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. And let's shift gear like the little bit again. The Teams has been one of the super
success stories there for you guys over the last two years. Like where are we in terms
of adoption, but also adoption of the diﬀerent subcomponents that were sitting
within Teams?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. Yes. Well, in terms of broad adoption, we announced 250 million monthly active
users of Teams. And someone who's been on the Teams journey from day one, it'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-08
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 12Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Kirk Koenigsbauerpretty awesome to see what that growth has been. And no question, the product was
growing before the pandemic and there's deﬁnitely been a lot of acceleration
through it. We see -- one thing I look at quite a bit is, are we seeing broad
deployments across big, big enterprises and now we're over 130 organizations, have
100,000 seat or more deployments, which is a really good signal of what that
adoption looks like. And then, of course, there's a long tail of organizations that are
deploying broadly, too.
When you talk about within the sub components, just as a reminder, folks that may
not be as steeped in it, Teams has core chat and messaging capability, collaboration
capability, it's got this voice-based calling service as well that we call phone system.
It has oﬃce integration, and of course, there's a platform for third-parties ISVs as well
as businesses IT departments to build their own line of business solutions into
Teams. And really across the board, we're seeing nice uptick on all this. Obviously,
meetings, as you might expect has been a huge growth driver over the course of the
last couple of years. But we see -- we really see growth across the board.
Just as an example, going back to our ﬁrst-line worker conversation, we've seen just
150% increase in usage around these frontline worker solutions inside of Teams itself.
And so it's become a really nice host for us to birth new experiences. In fact, I'll tell
you, I recently took over responsibility for one of our workloads called Yammer. And
the growth and we've integrated Yammer inside of Teams, the growth of Yammer
inside of Teams is so fast now, it's eclipsed the standalone part of the Yammer
business. We have many, many stories like that of new products that we're birthing
that are launching as a part of Teams and growing as a part of that growth. So it's
been really exciting to see that.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. And where are we on the speciﬁcally on video, voice because that's the -- I
mean, to me it's almost a hidden success because like the more conversations I have
with people in the ﬁeld, the more is like, yes, this is kind of really good. It's not the
Skype anymore, this is kind of feels like very, very good and powerful. Where are we
on that realization and adoption?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes, it is a bit of a sleeper I guess. We have about 80 million monthly active users on
what we talk about is our phone system solution. That essentially is, again, our voice-
over-IP sort of P2P calling between like you and me, if you and I wanted to have a
phone call, we can do that over Teams. And that has grown immensely, particularly,
over the last couple of years. We have completely -- you mentioned Skype before,
we have completely replanted the backend infrastructure that manages all of our
calling, all of our meeting and calling infrastructure essentially. And so we feel very,
very good about our position there.
I think the interesting thing that's happened is that the basic phone call is never
going to be the same. I mean, people want to now see each other whether they're
using Teams or Zoom or FaceTime or whatever, like, it doesn't really matter. There's a
whole new standard for what a calling experience is. And so we feel really quiteFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-08
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 12Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Kirk Koenigsbauerfortunate to be in a position where Teams in and of itself is not just a voice-over-IP
solution, but it's a solution that can integrate in these great collaboration
experiences and deep integration with Oﬃce and so forth, whether you're doing a
one-on-one or a team meeting.
And so we really feel that that's helped drive some of this and it's really I think
changing calling forever. And of course, hybrid is going to be a big part of that. So
the other piece that's been important for us as we really have repivoted how we
work with our operators. And you talk about all these diﬀerent markets and working
with them closely to build the PSTN component of the solution into this has been a
big part, too. And so we feel really good about the broad traction of end-user usage
as well as partners getting on board with us with Teams.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. Yes. No, that sounds really exciting. Yes, and as I said, I see it more and more, so
it's got a really good progress. Another thing that I have to admit like it doesn't
probably get enough airtime on our side is Viva and I do the German pronunciation.
I hope that's correct. Can you talk -- I mean, if I talk to Microsoft people, they are a lot
-- there is a huge level of excitement around that. It has been really kind of come
over to our side as well. Can you just talk to that a little bit?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. And I should tell you, I'm extremely biased here because I am on point for the
company to drive our Viva business and run some of our products there. I would tell
you, maybe even going back to where we started. This notion of the new hybrid
work model as well as this great reshuﬄe has just put an incredible focus on the
notion of what is the right employee experience. As I referenced, you've got this
massive talent war that's out there. Employers have never, I think, in time at least I've
been in this business, have never really cared so much so deeply about the
development of their people, their careers, their learning, their skilling, how they can
advance. I think one of the things that's been a real lesson here for leaders over the
course of the last two years is you have to keep your folks motivated. They have to
understand what your mission is, because people today they care more than just
about getting a pay check.
And so there's been a lot of focus on creating a great employee experience. And to
be candid with you, it's not been awesome for many, many people for a long time.
This is a space that's got -- it's super fragmented. There's a lot of diﬀerent ISP
solutions in there. They're all good individually, but they're not interconnected. And I
think what we decided to do is focus on this employee experience category, and
we've introduced this thing called Viva. And we just announced it in February so it's
not surprising that it's not super, super well known. But we are talking in a pretty big
way and we just actually hit within the last month general availability for our four --
our ﬁrst four core workloads which are around learning, knowledge management,
we have a workload that's around insights. So what's happening with the wellness
and productivity of your employee base. And we have one called Connections,
which is helpful to connect people to diﬀerent employee experiences throughout an
organization.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-08

A - Kirk KoenigsbauerAll this we have our own ﬁrst party solutions, but we're opening it up to third-parties
as well. And we're really quite bullish on it. We bought a company called Ally.io back
in September/October. That service that provides OKR's objectives and key results, I
think goals and mission alignment up and down an organization. We're excited
about that. So this is going to be a big area of investment for us. And our point of
diﬀerentiation is, we're building this right into Microsoft 365 and into Teams. And
again, a lot of -- there are solutions out there in the marketplace today, but they're
isolated, they're point solutions, when was the last time anybody sort of wanted to
go to their learning management portal. It's not very natural.
So by building it into Teams, where we can have nudges and we can make
recommendations based on our broad Microsoft graph of intelligence that we have
and sort of build it into what we talk about is the ﬂow of work. We think we're going
to see much, much higher adoption and engagement. And frankly, that's what
organizations need. They really need their employees using the stuﬀ to get the
development, to get the skilling, to get the insights that they need to be, stronger
employees and be able to contribute. And so that's a huge opportunity for us as we
think going forward.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Is that -- just one more question. Is it somewhat LinkedIn, we have the learning
experience platforms out there? And I would think it's somewhat might link with
dynamics as well to some degree? Like that -- yes, okay.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Okay. Yes. For sure, like, we work really closely obviously with LinkedIn, a big part of
Microsoft. We have a very close set of integrations there, where our learning
application that we built as a part of Viva actually includes as a part of the service, a
bunch of LinkedIn courses. And then it also oﬀers the full LinkedIn catalog of over
20,000 or 30,000 diﬀerent trainings and coursework that folks can do. And so we
essentially have a very tight coupling there between those. But we also work with
SuccessFactors and Pluralsight and a bunch of other really sort of well-established
learning providers to be able to provide their content into our solution within Teams
directly. And we think that's going to be a nice value proposition for people to grow.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. And you're coming from a diﬀerent angle. You're coming from the employee
productivity angle rather than the compliance HR angle, where it was almost like
forced on you? Yes, yes.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
That's right. We're putting the employee ﬁrst in this process to make sure they've got
really great sort of consumer-grade, consumer ethos types of experiences. And we
think that that will, again, built into Teams, built into the ﬂow work will be really
competitive.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-08

Q - Raimo Lenschow{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes, yes, I can see that. Yes, that sounds really exciting. Yes. The -- Kirk, last couple of
minutes, I want to talk about security like you've mentioned it several times already.
But I think it needs his own little section here. So that's why I'm talking about it like a
little bit more. Can you talk a little bit about the evolution here, because like I
remember like I published a big report on that, and I was surprised how much
progress you guys have made and how comprehensive you've been, got the
number wrong completely because it was actually much, much bigger business than
I kind of -- and then we modeled at a time or before at the time? Just can you talk a
little bit about the evolution there?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. No, it's been a great three, four years building out our security oﬀerings.
Obviously, security has been important to Microsoft for a while. It's core part of the
operating system, it's been a core part of Azure and M365. But we've really started to
focus on in the last three, four years. And it's great to have Charlie Bell on point a
new leader with such history to sort of running our security oﬀerings all up and
wonderful to have him now at the company.
But as I referenced earlier, this is a huge deal for every organization that we talk to.
Cybercrime is something like a $6 trillion sort of cost to the economy. And if you sort
of think about that for a second, that would actually make it, if you were a country, it
would be the third largest country in the world after China and the United States. So
this is a huge, huge deal for every single CEO, CIO, CSO for sure.
And the challenges they face today are things like fragmentation that got 50 plus
systems. No joke, 50 plus systems for diﬀerent types of security or compliance
workloads in their company and that creates just a ton of complexity. And it also
creates risk in terms of how these are integrated together and are they
interoperating as the way that they should, are they sharing signal and so forth to
understand what this risk looks like, a lot of these services are still on-prem based.
And so they're not as up-to-date. They're not able to take advantage of the power of
AI and the cloud compute that it can oﬀer in the security space to sort of get ahead
of this as opposed to constantly being on defense.
And going maybe a little bit back to the employee experience piece. Every company
I talk to can't hire enough or fast enough security experts. And so they have to rely
on companies like Microsoft. And so we have seen a big push here, folks want to get
to Zero Trust. They have to assume that breach is going to happen. And so how do
you sort of -- how do you protect against that? And yes, we announced recently that
Microsoft is now greater than $10 billion business in the security space. So it is a
huge, huge deal for us. And we're super committed to the category. So hopefully,
that gives you a quick overview.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. No, totally. Yes. Yes. I mean one of the stuﬀ that does come up on the earnings
call is EMS. And you talk about the growth there. We have a seat number like and itFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-08

A - Kirk Koenigsbauerdoes seem like a very big kind of penetration number as well. Like how do you drive
growth there? What are the kind of the factors to consider?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Well, yes, it's sort of two parts there. One is, you're absolutely correct. I mean, EMS,
our enterprise mobility and security suite is absolutely the cornerstone of our
security oﬀerings and our Zero Trust approach. I mean it is the thing that provides
the identity plane inside of any organization with Azure Active Directory and the
management plane with something that we call Microsoft Endpoint Manager. These
are both collectively so core to running a company's infrastructure and running it
securely. As we referenced, the growth of Azure AD is really strong, we have over
500 million monthly active users there, 300,000 paid. I mean, it is a very, very big
business for us and a super important one, again, as the sort of cornerstone for all
this.
One thing, by the way, that's not often talked about is, it's not just about protecting
sort of Microsoft commercial services, but also a host of cloud identity solutions for
third-parties, too. And that's a very, very fast-growing part of the business. And then
on the management side, I think it's a little bit under looked sometime how
important this is. The relationship between security and management, I mean, they
are, it's peanut butter and jelly essentially, you can't have a strong security
infrastructure if your management isn't up-to-date, if it isn't moving to the cloud, if it
isn't ready for hybrid, if it's not consolidating. And so that's why EMS is just so core to
our security story all up.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. Yes. And then if you think about it like, is there -- on the one hand there is a seat,
it's like Amy on every conference calls is like look you need to be careful. If you
couldn't look at Azure, there's EMS in there and seats (inaudible). Are they the
similar, the same factors that you should think about it? And we talked earlier on the
Oﬃce side in terms of further penetration there, or what would be like other things
to consider?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. No, we deﬁnitely see that there's room for growth with Azure Active Directory. I
mean, I think, there's still a lot of legacy on-prem out there. There's this push to
hybrid as we've talked a little bit about and making sure that organizations have a
robust identity platform, given the fact that there's so much hybrid, so much remote
work. There's going to be continued consolidation. We've talked about password
lists, my God, what a hassle passwords have been for the last 30 years, and we've
got to move beyond that. And Azure Active Directory, our identity solution is moving
in that direction to get rid of passwords, which we think will be key.
Verify credentials, there's so many elements of this business that are -- that we feel
like are going to be real good growth drivers for us going forward, let alone the
third-party app piece that I mentioned, too. Customers want -- no one wants to move
to a single vendor entirely, of course, but you do want to remove a lot of the
complexity that's in the environments today and this is one of the ways to do it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-08

Yes. Kirk, I see my time is up. I'm getting the ﬂag here, too. But I mean it was so great
talking with you. There's many diﬀerent areas we could have touched on top of that,
but it was great having you. Thanks for that, for the conversation, really exciting. It's
great to have you here as well. Thank you.
