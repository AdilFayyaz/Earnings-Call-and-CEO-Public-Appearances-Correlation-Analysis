Hi. Good afternoon. It's Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. I am the
hardlines/broadlines, and grocery analyst here at the ﬁrm. Thank you, for those who
maybe are just starting with us today, for joining us at Goldman Sachs 28th Annual
Global Retail Conference. We're very happy to be joined by Doug McMillon, CEO of
Walmart.
Before we get into our ﬁreside chat, we have a couple of housekeeping things we
wanted to mention to you. First, you should be able to see a couple of survey
questions on your screen. If you'd like to go ahead and answer those, that would be
great, and we'll be able to keep track of those results as the presentation goes on,
kind of oﬀ to the right of your screens, just to get a pulse of what your view is on the
state of the world.
And the second housekeeping thing I wanted to mention is, we're going to have
plenty of time for Q&A at the end of the ﬁreside chat, I have noted that there is a
little bit of a delay in getting those questions from you to my inbox. So, I would just
suggest if you want to get your question in, just send it little bit on the earlier side,
maybe 15 minutes before the end just to make sure that I see it and can ask it on your
behalf.
And then, ﬁnally, before we start, I just want to ﬂag the Safe Harbor disclosure on
Walmart's website. And with that, we can get started. Doug, thank you so much for
joining us today. It's great to see you.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Nice to see you, Kate. Thanks for the invitation.

Doug McMillonSo I wondered if we could start with just a state of the consumer. Given Walmart's
size and scale, we just wanted to maybe take a step back here and talk about the
consumer. It's been an unprecedented year not just because of the pandemic, but
also because of the amount of money the consumer has received over the last 18
months. And even though it was front-half loaded, it seems like the outlook in
demand for most of retail is rather robust. So I was wondering if you could talk to us
about what you're hearing and seeing from the consumer, and what your view is on
the sustainability of the consumer balance sheet and demand?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. As we indicated with our second quarter results, the consumer is feeling pretty
good and they're spending money and we don't see an abrupt stop to that. I think
you've got a continuum, of course, of income levels and wealth levels in the US and
there are going to be a lot of people with plenty of spending capacity. For customers
at the lower end of that scale, wage rates are going up. So as we look ahead to next
year in the US in particular and to some extent in other markets, I think that's one of
the things in addition to some of the things that are happening with various forms of
government assistance will cause us to have a consumer that's strong for some time.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
That's great. I wanted to ask too about just Walmart. Since the beginning of the
pandemic, I was once in the audience of a ﬁreside chat that you were participating in
and the interviewer had asked you what you would thank your predecessors for that
had set up Walmart to be the retailer you are today. And at the time you had said,
selling food and focusing and keeping stores pretty much that's what you said I
think. And this chat occurred before the pandemic, of course. So, I was curious,
stealing that question, would the answer be the same today? And given what you
saw during the pandemic, is there anything that you would do diﬀerently going
forward?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. And the people that were here before us did a lot of good things that have put
us in a good position as a Company. And to your point about food, the work that the
Company did in the '90s and the 2000s to build out a supply chain and to get better
fresh food and build scale in food deﬁnitely contributed to the success of our
Supercenters in the US and in other markets. So it's a really powerful store format.
And as I've been doing this a long time and been to lot of places, I wouldn't trade
the Supercenter format for anything. It's a great place to shop, our customers still
enjoy it, I enjoy it. Yeah, I do a lot of e-commerce shopping and my family gets
orders delivered to our house and we do grocery pickup, and Supercenter pickup,
but we also still go in the stores.
We see a lot of opportunity going forward to add things to the stores and keep them
fresh. I'm excited about what we're doing in the health care clinics and excited about
what we're doing with market fulﬁllment centers to help us with inventory disposition
for last-mile, our big parking lots and our big stores give us room to do a lot ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09

Page 3 of 17Kate McShane
Doug McMillondiﬀerent things. And then just department by department, we still got room to
improve. So thankful for the base of food and consumables, plus general
merchandise, and things like everyday low price.
In terms of what we would have done diﬀerently, I would have had a lot more
capacity for pickup and delivery through our stores than what we had. I mean it's
really tight for our associates working in our back rooms to be able to stage all of
these orders as the pandemic hit and they did a great job of ﬁguring that out and
ﬂexing, but as we said in our investor conference in February, we need more
capacity through our supply chain. We need it with what's ﬂowing into stores and the
role that stores will play in delivering for customers and for pickup.
We also need more capacity for e-commerce for ﬁrst-party and third-party
businesses. Like, our marketplace business is growing, if we could change anything
about that right now, we'd have a lot more fulﬁllment capacity for our marketplace
sellers, Walmart Fulﬁllment Services is growing, but one of the reasons why we
stepped up our capital number in February is because we need more capacity in
both of those ways. And then we also have various forms of automation that are now
in place that you may want to talk about at some point during this discussion. But
that's what I would have changed and I'm glad we had grocery pickup and delivery
and it certainly got used, but we need even more throughput.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
That's helpful. Thank you, and if we could kind of stay still very high level and then I'll
get into some of the more granular questions. But one thing that's really seemed to
have changed pretty notably is the state of the supply chain. I know there's been a
lot of disruption since the pandemic, and in diﬀerent forms, but I think just within the
last month or so you've seen a lot more consternation in the entire supply chain. I
just was curious, in your tenure, have you ever experienced this amount of disruption
in the supply chain before and how have you mitigated it?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I think it's more dramatic than what I can remember. There have been various
challenges but not anything like this. I think it's a combination of the pandemic,
change behavior, government investments, as you said, consumers have money and
other factors that have led to it. And it's helpful to have a lot of merchants with a lot
of experience. I do think these challenges will be worked through. I do think supply
chains move. The supply chain -- where products come from is diﬀerent today than it
was in previous generations. I think we'll see shifts that continue to occur. In the
United States, about two-thirds of what we sell is made or grown here. In Mexico,
that number is over 90% because we've got such a stronger food business. So that's
helpful.
But as it relates to some categories, some general merchandise categories, and
imports, it's tough to get the containers through the system. So, containers are a lot
more expensive. We're having to divert to diﬀerent ports. In some cases, there are
driver shortages. Our private ﬂeet is functioning well, but common carriers areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09

Doug McMillonhaving some issues. So, there are a lot of things to overcome and it requires
creativity and ﬂexibility. We were happy to report in the second quarter that we had a
lot more inventory than a year ago. In 2020, at the end of the second quarter, we
were way too light in stores and on the e-commerce side. So, we would take even
more inventory, if we could get it, especially in some categories.
Just lastly, the focus on seasonal businesses is a priority for us. We did a nice job of
getting our back-to-school inventory in in-time and back-to-school has been really
successful. Now, we've got Halloween in front of us, and Thanksgiving, and
Christmas. Those goods are ﬂowing and we're moving quickly to make sure that we
get as much of that product in and as quickly as we can.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
When you think about some of these challenges within the supply chain, do you see
an opportunity within the competitive landscape to take some share and how are
you thinking about that over the next six to 12 months?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I was meeting with one of our largest suppliers last week here in person and they
were complementing our merchandising team on creativity and ﬂexibility. And I do
think scale can help and relationships can help, but creativity shouldn't be
underestimated. We've had some supplier relationships where they've reduced the
number of SKUs. They're making the focused lines on fewer items. That's been
helpful. We've been more ﬂexible on packaging. There's just a lot of need to be in
the moment and to manage a ﬂuid situation and not get stuck in your ways or have
certain requirements if that means you're not going to have the inventory that you
need.
And our merchants have so much experience. They've been able to overcome
things. When supplier A has an issue, they can move to supplier B, C, D, E, F to try
and compensate in some way, and they've done a really nice job doing that. So we'd
like to have more inventory, we got room to improve, but I want to thank our
merchants and replenishment team for what they've done.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
That's great. So if I can go maybe into more granular questions now. When thinking
through grocery, home, and apparel, how are you thinking about your competitive
position within each category today? How does private label and branded
partnership impact the outlook for each and what category are you feeling the best
about right now in terms of upside potential?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
We do have diﬀerent market share situations by category as everybody would know
and that just points to opportunity. There are some categories where we have reallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 17Kate McShane
Doug McMillonnice shares and others, where customers are telling us we can do a better job. We've
got opportunities in each. When I think about each one, on the food side, the dry
grocery and consumables team, they've done a nice job. And that's about product
innovation and price and in-stock, but in some of the other categories, take produce,
for example, there is a lot to sourcing quality and having a relationship direct with
the right growers and planning out ahead of time and driving innovation and in a
number of diﬀerent ways to make that happen and it all has to land in a beautiful
presentation in the stores.
And I think we've made a lot of progress in produce. There is still an upside for us
there, but the team's done a really good job. We've made some progress on steaks,
but we'd like for our beef program to be stronger and we've done some things to
help set the stage for that going forward. We opened a dairy facility. That's helped us
in some ways. So, there is vertical integration and investment in fresh. So when I think
about food, the ﬁrst thing that goes through my mind is fresh because of the unique
challenges and opportunities of each one of those categories represent.
In home, we've had strong growth and we've seen in the last two years, a big step up
in our e-commerce business. I think, on the home side, we do have some room to
improve in stores, but the biggest opportunity is online. We just have so much room
to grow with our assortment, ﬁrst-party and some third-party in the home categories.
And then apparel is the one that (inaudible) our team what they hear for me the
most apparel is near the top of that list or at the top of that list because I see so
much opportunity for us on the e-commerce side to add SKUs, add brands, improve
our execution. And while we've had tremendous growth in the last couple of years,
there's just a lot more upside in front of us in apparel.
And everything I've just mentioned is Walmart US. We have similar opportunities in
markets, certainly, some diﬀerences by market but look at what Sam's Club has done
with general merchandise, it's been great and their private brand progress -- to your
point about private brands and the role they play with Member's Mark, for example,
has been outstanding on the quality side. So we have opportunities. We're doing
well, but we can grow even more.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
You had mentioned 1P versus 3P, and I know that you've been as a way to
diﬀerentiate a little bit more selective when it came to 3P. So I wondered if you could
maybe take a step back and talk to us about where you are in the 3P initiatives? How
you're diﬀerentiating Walmart when it comes to 3P and how you balance the 3P
versus 1P when you're talking to your customers?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. If I could go back in time, we will probably be even more aggressive on the 3P
side to improve our seller tools and the ability for sellers to onboard, to get their
items set up, and stuﬀ like that, which we are making progress on. Maybe more
importantly, more fulﬁllment capacity because the ﬁrst thing that we have to
prioritize is the customer experience, and we can control the 1P experience muchFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 17Kate McShane
Doug McMillonmore so, think of on-time delivery, for example, then we can with marketplace. So
one of the governors on marketplace growth has been fulﬁllment services.
We're now seeing that grow and this step up in capital that we covered in February is
also pointed towards that. So, we'll have more capacity to do both 1P and 3P. That 3P
component is really important. That enables us to continue to grow marketplace
sellers aggressively with some degree of curation. We do care about the quality that
our customers experience, some level of vetting there to make sure that those sellers
are high-quality sellers and they deliver for customers and we know something
about those items. That's important to us. So we've curated more than some as it
relates to the marketplace.
I think that will be the case long term, but there is still so much upside in it, even with
those kinds of standards. So, if we can get this capacity put down, I think it unlocks a
lot more 3P growth in addition to what we want to do with 1P.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
That's helpful. Maybe I'm not -- on that same note, when it comes to digital,
omnichannel fulﬁllment or omni-fulﬁllment investments, fulﬁllment it just sounds in
general like, you need a little bit more investment there, but can you talk a little bit
about customer awareness and response for all the optionality you now have with
regards to pick up? It seems like again that you were on that path before the
pandemic, but certainly, there has been a lot more choice for the consumer since
then. And how much has the fulﬁllment optionality alleviated headwinds within your
e-commerce business?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. It deﬁnitely helped. I mean if you look at our percent to total of orders
delivered, the store percentage has gone up. E-commerce fulﬁllment centers have
increased in volume too, of course, but the mix has shifted a little bit more towards
stores. It's going to be so fun to watch what happens over the next few years with
automation through both of those channels. If I can oversimplify it, it's more of a
network in two channels, but if we could describe it as just those two dimensions, I
think it'd be helpful. One path goes through distribution centers, stores and there's
automation happening in the DCs that's very cool, and there is automation that will
happen in some store locations with market fulﬁllment centers, that's really cool.
I think cards with wheels, automated storage and retrieval systems, those things are
going to be more productive, unlock more SKUs, help us achieve some of these
volume levels that we need to achieve. With this whole conversation around capacity
and capital, the good thing is we've got demand. Like it's not that we're building
something hoping that we're going to have demand. We've seen the demand, and
we know we need it, to build to it, and get ahead of it. So that's a helpful reality.
So I'm excited about both of those chains. And I think in the end what you end up
with is the customers will let us deliver into their homes, into their kitchens, into theirFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)

Kate McShanegarages, into refrigerators. They'll let us do unattended delivery on their front step.
They'll do kind of traditional delivery We'll have a component of that that will be
independent contractors through other third-party platforms. We've got our own
Spark platform that's scaling and there'll be some portion of associates involved in
that too.
And by putting all that in place, there will be this kind of seamless situation, which is
happening with a lot of our customers today, where they shop in-store, they pick up,
they do delivery and they don't really think about the form that that takes. They just
think about Walmart, the items that they want, the prices that they're getting and
they shop in this very ﬂuid fashion that's happening. And that's happening in my
family, it's happening in with a lot of customers. And I think that's great. We can be
somewhat indiﬀerent as to how they want to take delivery. We're just there to serve
them however they want.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
And within that, Doug, where does Walmart+ come in and how much can you tell us
about Walmart+ today? I feel like it's still on the cusp here.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Well, I know that people have gotten excited about various memberships, including
Disney+ and what's happening at Amazon and everywhere else. So, I know it's very
topical. And that it's important for us to have a membership and we wanted to
launch it, but we also want to make sure that the net promoter score is high. And as I
mentioned, we don't have all the capacity that we need. So the worst thing we could
do is to really aggressively market this, get a bunch of members that are
disappointed because they can't get a slot, or they don't get the right in-stock level,
or some of their problem happens.
So the primary focus we have is on that quality of the experience, delivery or pickup,
and that net promoter score. This capacity investment enables us to be more
aggressive with Walmart+ over time and grow it the right rate. I would call it kind of a
quality rate. That's what our focus is. So we'll talk about it some, but we did try to
reduce the importance of it because in the big scheme of things, with what's
happening at Walmart, it's just one factor. It shouldn't be -- it shouldn't punch above
its weight.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. One initiative that we've written a lot about because
I think it's pretty exciting is Walmart Connect, and personally, we're excited about
given what it could mean for margins. So I wonder if you could talk a little bit more in
detail about all the avenues in which you're pursuing for Walmart Connect, whether
it's online advertising, in-store advertising, selling data to vendors. Where is all the
revenue coming from and is this something that can be pursued across all categories
in the store?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09

Kate McShane{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I think it can go across all categories. We separate in terms of how we think about it,
the advertising component, Walmart Connect, from data monetization with suppliers
or with others. So, those are two diﬀerent businesses. And we've got a great
opportunity with data monetization and we've started to do some of that but there is
more to come there. On the advertising side, on Walmart Connect side, as we said at
the end of the second quarter, it almost doubled. I think we grew at 95% during the
second quarter and it's still relatively small compared to the size of our business and
the various categories where this will take place.
Primarily, it will be digital, it will be through e-commerce, it will be on our app, it will
be on our site, but there are some in-store opportunities too. And one of the reasons
why advertisers are interested in what we oﬀer is because we're doing so much
volume in-store that may ﬂow from a digital ad later on -- later than the moment of
the digital ad being in front of the customer. And we can close that loop and say, we
showed this ad to this person. They didn't actually transact until ﬁve days later in-
store, and we can connect that transaction and show it to people. And because that
volume in stores is so big, it's a unique oﬀer from an advertising point of view.
So we think there is a lot of growth there. We think that number will get bigger and
bigger and grow for a long time, and it won't be just the United States. We've got
traction in some other markets too. I think it will be important in Mexico and other
places, India.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Thank you. I wondered if we could pivot to back to the US business, the grocery
business. Grocery, it looks like it gained some market share over the past two
quarters after some in-stock challenges during the pandemic. And it seems like
maybe customers are being more sensitive to price. So, I wondered if that's right, are
those the main drivers of your recent share gain, are there other drivers there? And
to what degree is increased traﬃc driving the increase versus better in-stocks?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I think you answered the question. I think you hit all three, Kate. I do think that the
second quarter of 2020, ﬁscal '21, we were out of stock. I mean our supply chain was
built to turn and when that surge happened, and for I think safety reasons given the
pandemic, people were shopping closer to home and in smaller stores, but we just
didn't have as much inventory as we needed by a long shot. So inventory recovery is
the biggest issue. Price matters and we've got a nice set of price gaps right now and
are obviously watching that closely. And then, with the second quarter in particular,
pre the delta surge, store traﬃc came back really strong and I'm sure that helped
share some too. So, I think those are the three drivers.

Doug McMillonAnd I was curious to what your view is on food at home. Are you surprised at how
long the strength in food at home has persisted? Would you have expected maybe a
little bit more of an unwind here as people got back to work and back-to-school?
And what is your view longer-term about the sustainability of just people eating at
home and buying grocery?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. I don't know if this shift to be permanent. It does feel like over a period of time,
it goes back to kind of the trends that we were seeing before the pandemic, but it is
lasting and delta is still with us. And so I don't know how to forecast what happens
with COVID and future variants. I think we're in a position to be ﬂexible and serve
people how they want to be served. If they are concerned about what's happening
in their area as it relates to COVID and they want to eat more home more over there,
if they want to do it in the store over there, if they want to pick up delivery over there,
having the food continue to be as easy to prepare and use as part of the equation.
High quality, low price, easy to prepare, could help us sustain this trend longer than
it would otherwise. So, both at Walmart and Sam's, we're focused on that. And Sam's
prepared meal business has been great and Sam's has expanded its curbside and is
expanding its delivery capability too. So that are really big, healthy, nice food
businesses at Sam's Club shouldn't be forgotten.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you. One of the -- sorry, my lights just turned out. One of the biggest
changes, I think, we've seen in the -- its story of the enterprise of Walmart is
enterprise operating income growth going from ﬂat to down to now for 2021, 9% to
11.5% growth. And I know this has been a big undertaking by the Company. So, I
wondered if you could help us parse out how you've been able to reverse the course
here, and how have you been able to grow operating dollars while still investing in
the business?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. We did go through a period of investment. And I am frequently getting the
question now about when is the next investment cycle or what's this going to look
like. And the way that I'm thinking about it is, the Company is going to constantly
invest. And you saw us increase our capital investment in February with the investor
conference. We've got a long-term bias, and we've got a top-line bias. And those are
both deliberate. And we'll manage the short-term and when things like supply chain
costs go up or COVID costs happen or a period of wage inﬂation occurs, we'll
manage through those things, but all the while investing to improve productivity
over time with things like this latest wave of automation that's going to come in the
next few years. So, that's part of the story.
The other part of the story is the make-up. The composition of top and bottom line at
Walmart has changed quite a bit and will change more. We look a while back at a
bar chart of how Walmart drove revenue and proﬁt and we basically only did it by
buying and selling merchandise. A little bit of membership income from Sam's ClubFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09

Page 10 of 17Kate McShane
Doug McMillonin terms of the percent of total and some ﬁnancial services income and other
sources, like tenants paying rent inside of Supercenters, but the other income
percentage was tiny. That's changed and will continue to change. Walmart Connect
is going to be a part of that, Walmart+ is going to be part of that, data monetization
will be part of that, Walmart Fulﬁllment Services is part of that, the marketplace take
rate is part of that. And so you end up with a more diversiﬁed and resilient business
over time, because you're making money in diﬀerent ways.
And when I went to business school, I was taught to be aware of diversiﬁcation. And I
saw like what General Electric did or what other companies did in these business
silos. And digital, changes all of that. I mean that's been one of the things that has
become apparent in recent years is that, when you become a digital company, you
can start to build businesses on top of other businesses in a way that's eﬃcient and
manageable. And so I'm not overly concerned about Walmart becoming too
diversiﬁed. It's one of the things that goes oﬀ in the back of my head every once a
while, it's just to keep an eye on focus and we have exited some international
markets, sold Vudu, and exited the restaurant business in Mexico, and other things,
sold banks.
So there has been some pruning as we've been doing, adding. In the end, when I
look at what we've got right now, I think, we can manage it, and I think we're
appropriately focused on what's most important. And that's unlocked to a great
degree by the digital aspects of the Company working in an agile fashion and the
modernization of our tech stack.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
That's great. And if I could maybe ask a question about just the other businesses.
Health and wellness has been an area, the last couple of years of focus and I've
heard you before I talk about what a big opportunity it is to bring aﬀordable health
care to your customer and then ﬁntech is maybe not as much talked about but is part
of what seems to be the ecosystem here. So, I wondered if you could maybe update
us on both initiatives to the extent that you can?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. They're both really big opportunities. Obviously, not simple, but in the case of
health and wellness, we've got these assets. We've got a big pharmacy business,
optical business, hearing business, large stores, large parking lots, room for clinics
that serve people when needed. And now, we've made this telehealth acquisition of
MeMD and we bought CareZone before. And so we've got a product roadmap that
we're putting together, that's got all the tech capabilities and product capabilities
related to serve a health care business that is a value-based system that enables us
to have a digital relationship that then eventually translates in the store when it
needs to or through a triage process, send them somewhere else if they need to go
somewhere else. And do that in a way that it's integrated into the app and store
experience so that it becomes a really natural and easy thing to do to come to
Walmart for expanded health care.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09

Doug McMillonWe were doing things like immunizations before the pandemic in a big way, ton of
ﬂu shots, for example, and now, we've been doing that with COVID immunizations.
People trust us for health care and they think of us as it relates to health care. And so
we're mixing those things together in a way that's become even more clear in recent
months as Dr. Cheryl Pegus joined us and helped John and I and some others get
even clearer about some speciﬁcs that we needed to go execute to build this
business. So I think there is more to come there but it would be rewarding in a few
years to be able to look back and see that Walmart actually helped the country and
helped the customers, helped the families by giving them access to high-quality care
at a great price and making them feel comfortable doing so. I've been in our clinics.
When people walked in and you can tell they're very uncomfortable to be in a health
care environment and they will ask questions like on our pricing board, is that really
the price to get my teeth cleaned, what else will hit me later, because they just don't
trust the system. We have so many people like that that we can help.
And then, on the ﬁnancial services side, we've got a pretty big ﬁnancial services
business, but I would characterize it as being analogue and the opportunity to make
it digital is right there in front of us. There are so many digital products that we can
go build that will help people with managing their family's expenses and their
accounts and ultimately, hopefully, build wealth. But we don't have bandwidth to do
everything and we needed some expertise and so we partnered with Micky Malka
and Ribbit, hired Omer Ismail from Goldman who recently was able to ﬁnally start
after sitting out the appropriate period. And so I think there is more to come as it
relates to what we'll be saying and doing in the coming months related to ﬁnancial
services.

Okay. Thank you. There are four questions that we're asking every company that's
presenting at our conference these two days, and technically it's four questions, and
the fourth question has two parts, but it's multiple choice. The ﬁrst question is, how
do you think about consumer demand going forward as we get further away from
stimulus, do you expect to see momentum accelerate, decelerate, or stay the same
through the end of 2021?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I think I would say, same, but if I had to take over or under, I'd take a little over. I think
customers' families want to celebrate Christmas. They want to have a Thanksgiving
and if this situation with the virus enables it and maybe even if it doesn't, we're going
to see strong demand through the rest of this year.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. The second question is, how do you think about digital penetration in '22
relative to what we saw in '21, will it be higher, lower, or the same?

Third question is, how we should think about promotions in 2022, will it be higher,
lower, or the same versus 2021?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
A little bit higher for the industry, but the same for Walmart. We don't promote a lot.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. And then, the fourth question, with the two parts. The ﬁrst question and all of
this has been touched on pretty much during our chat, but just to get the oﬃcial
answer, if you had to pick the biggest lever that you can use to mitigate supply chain
pressures, what would it be?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
It's changing sources of supply.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
And then, the second part is, do you expect inventories to grow faster or slower than
sales in the second half?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Faster. We got some catch up to do. We need more inventory.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. Great. And with that, I have a bunch of questions waiting for me in my inbox
from the audience. So, I'll start asking those, if that's okay. The ﬁrst question kind of
goes back to our discussion around operating income. Our operating margin is in a
better situation to expand now because you don't have to invest in price because
gap is already so big, or does increased input costs, supply chain costs, et cetera,
without raising price eﬀectively the same thing and thus operating margins are
seeing the same impact as if you were taking price investments?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. I think it's generally the former. Like our position as it relates to price is better.
And the cost pressures that we're feeling now related to COVID, supply chain costs,
like container costs, those are just short-term. So, that's the way that I think about
those. It's a little bit of both.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09

Okay. Thank you. Similar question but asked a little bit diﬀerently. Year-to-date versus
2020, what would you say has had a bigger impact on your operating margins, is it
lower promotions, lower e-com penetration or higher ASPs? It's mix, it's a fourth.
Answer, I think, it's the percentage of total that we're doing in categories like home,
apparel, hardlines.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Okay. And another question that we received was about the wage announcement
that you just made. Is that another $3 billion investment similar to what we saw in
March and has that been contemplated in your most recent guidance? Yes. It's been
contemplated in the guidance. It's a Phase 3 of a plan addressing some of the
positions that we hadn't addressed earlier.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
I guess just to follow up on that too just from a wage standpoint, your outlook on
wages, it does seem like maybe there is a little bit tighter supply and a lot more
competition for employment than maybe there was at the beginning of the year.
Could you talk at all about your outlook on wages, and if you see things maybe
accelerating a little bit more than what you originally thought starting 2021?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I think things did get hotter than what we would have thought at the beginning of
the year and I think the government assistance programs played a role in that. And
as you know, those are changing. So, the labor environment will change too. And
we'll do what we need to do store-by-store, or Club-by-Club to address the needs of
that market so that we can hire the people that we need to hire and retain the
people that we need to retain.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. Great. I'll just say we have a few more minutes for questions, so if anyone
wants to send another question in, you can go ahead and do that. In the meantime, I
just wanted to ask one more question on behalf of us. I would be remiss if I didn't
mention Sam's Club. I know it always is sometimes second ﬁddle although it's doing
so well. So I just wondered if you could talk about the new members that you're
seeing? I know you've had a lot of sign-ups. It seems like it's pretty sticky customer
base. Just how are you thinking about those new customers, what can it do for Sam's
business longer term and how do you ensure they stay?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. Merchandise quality is the ﬁrst thing that comes to mind, the assortment and
the quality of that assortment. And what has been happening is that Kath and theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09

Doug McMillonteam had been improving private brands. In particular, our Member's Mark product
in food and other categories was really good from a quality point of view. A lot of
progress had been made, and then when the pandemic occurred and so many
people came to clubs, they saw it and I think that's what's driven a lot of the renewal
rates, is that they really liked what they bought and they liked the experience of
buying it.
And then the team layered on curbside delivery, the use of scan and go. Our scan
and go percentage at Sam's is a lot higher than it is at Walmart, pointing to an
opportunity there. So, everything I'm seeing in the underlying membership metrics,
the detailed metrics, looks really promising and does look like a sticky relationship,
so really excited about that. Great to see the momentum there. Thanks for asking
about Sam's.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
You're welcome. One more set of questions that we got in. You had mentioned the
tech stack I think earlier. Just what are the biggest changes Walmart has made over
those last three years to the tech stack and what's next?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. A number of things, I mean the team there led by Suresh is doing a fantastic
job. They have not only built some great new products and systems, but they have
shut down a lot of older stuﬀ. They've changed the way we think about our
architecture and they've moved us more aggressively to the cloud. They've got a
clear strategy on when we'll use private cloud and when we use other providers. And
that's enabled so much ﬂexibility. I mean, we expanded our e-commerce business
partially because of the work that had been done before that to position the
technology to do so. So we can handle surge capacity, we can do things that we
couldn't do before.
And the most important work right now that we're all focused on is this move to a
diﬀerent app design. About 10% of our transactions in the US on the Walmart app
today are going through a design that's diﬀerent than what we were using
previously. And by the end of September, here in the next few weeks, we think that
will be close to 100% of the transactions. The new design gets us away from what we
have been calling our two-hallway design. Some people might remember we used
to have two apps for a good reason at the time, but we had grocery app, it was
Orange, we had the Walmart app that was blue. We merged those together into one
app, two hallways a while back. But that still leads you into, if you go into that ﬁrst
hallway, a narrower assortment. So, just think about the items that are there, that are
bought frequently and the margins on those as opposed to the margins in the
broader assortment, and the proﬁtability from the marketplace.
This latest design moves us to one universal search, the two hallways go away, it's
one experience, and so now we can serve up not only the items you're buying all the
time, maybe it's consumable with a general merchandise side, like a new sweater,
but also expose the marketplace to customers in a more intuitive improved design.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09

Doug McMillonSo that technology has taken a lot of time and resources as we put that behind us
and re-platform the app over the next few weeks, we get even more bandwidth to
go work on some other things that we want to work on. All of that was possible
because of the tech team that we have today.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Thank you for that. We have a couple of more questions. Delivery, which I didn't ask
that, but I am curious. How are you approaching delivery ﬁrst-party versus third-party
and how should we think about that going forward?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. I think it's going to be such a growth opportunity for us to do various forms of
delivery. We've been using other platforms, other independent contractor platforms
and we'll continue to. We think about that geography at a time and that's enabled us
to scale quickly and it has been so important to us, and so helpful. We also launched
quite a while ago our own independent contractor platform called Spark. That has
scaled and is now providing a lot of deliveries in the United States. And I do think
this Walmart in home capability with our own associates will continue to grow.
So I think in the future, you will see electric vehicles with Walmart branding on it.
Hopefully, someday UAV, you'll see us use drones, you'll see us use our own
associates. It will be a blend of last-mile capabilities. And there'll be some times
when we're delivering a big basket, like in the case of my family now, we get a big
basket delivery into our garage, into the refrigerator once or twice week. It's $100 to
$150 every time they come. And we'll also have items that if you want to get it very
quickly, drone is going to drop it in our backyard.
Yesterday, John sent me a video of a ﬁxed-wing drone that's not far from here that
we're now launching, that's going to drop stuﬀ in our backyards around here and
we're building in the store across the street a market fulﬁllment center with
automation in it for pickup and delivery orders using the store in that last mile kind
of way. We'll be launching DroneUp drones and other types of providers I'm sure
from that location. So it will be a bit of all the above and the math will just guide.
Based on what the customer wants, kind of the SLA thinking for a customer, the math
will guide which delivery form we use.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you. Back to our conversation about the mix of your business, are you
expecting the mix of non-consumables to normalize as we get further removed from
the government stimulus, or do you hold on tighter to the level of discretionary mix
going forward?

Kate McShaneWe certainly want to hold on to it. And I think e-commerce is one of the most
important ways that we need to do that. And that takes you back to how many
brands and SKUs can you add in apparel, do you have a really complete home
assortment, not just good and better, but good, better, and best. So I think we'll hold
some of it. We'll try to hold all of it if we can, but it will be driven by the assortment
and the pricing, our ability to execute
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. And I think for our last question because it's kind of a bigger topic that I did
not ask about is just International in general, if it could be boiled down to that. I
know you have made reﬁnements in the portfolio. It seems like international is doing
maybe a little bit better than expected this year. Could you maybe talk about some
of the wins and what you're seeing with some of those businesses?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. Thank you. We do end up with a US-centric conversation about this Company
all too often. A great business in Walmex, tremendous momentum, great leadership
team, a lot of innovation, a ﬂywheel that looks like the US. Doing well in Canada,
remarkable job serving people during this pandemic and a big and important
business there and a really strong team there. India's growing quickly, both Flipkart
and PhonePe have performed really well, overcome the challenges with shutdowns
and things like that and really capable management team, very innovative. We are
learning a lot from what's happening in India. Those are standouts.
I should mention China. Our Sam's Club business in China is every bit as good
strong as what it is here in the US. So you've got more visibility into Sam's US than
you do Sam's China, but Sam's China is strong. Walmex is performing well in Mexico
too, but the Sam's business in China is just -- it's amazing, really strong membership
growth, really strong NPS scores, merchandise quality getting better. So, it's a
diﬀerent portfolio than it was before. The UK, Japan, Argentina, we're a minority
investor and that's helped create some focus. And you're right, Judith and the team
have a ton of momentum, and not only this year, but the two parts of last year too
performed better than expected.

longer, but we're going to give back about 10 minutes of time. So we appreciate,
