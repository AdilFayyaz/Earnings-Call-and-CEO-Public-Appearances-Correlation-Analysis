: Needham & Company:} Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome. My name is Raji Gill,
I'm the Managing Director of Global Semiconductor and Automotive Technology
Research here in Needham & Company. Welcome to our 24th Annual Growth
Conference here at Needham. Wish we could be in person, but it is what it is. But
we're happy for everyone that's joining.
We're very pleased to have Colette Kress from NVIDIA Chief Financial Oﬃcer as well
as the IR team as well Stewart and Simona Jankowski. This will be a ﬁreside chat
about 40 minutes for folks that have questions that are listening on the webcast, feel
free to text -- write them in the textbox message and then I will relay those messages.
So with that, Colette, welcome.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you for having us.

(Question And Answer)
: Needham & Company:} My pleasure. So Colette, if we could maybe ﬁrst start with
the gaming segment. The gaming segment has had a tremendous amount of growth
in 2021, is the most recent quarter was up about 42% year-over-year. And the
demand was pretty much strong across the board, desktop and laptop computers.
On the most recent call, you mentioned that only about 25% of your 250 million
GeForce installed base is on the latest Ampere GPU architecture.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-10

Q - Rajvindra Gill
A - Colette KressSo that implies a kind of a signiﬁcant upgrade cycle that's underway over the next
couple of years. So I wanted to get a sense of what percentage of your consumers
upgrade their cards every generation? And are there generation skips that are
common? Do you -- are you seeing kind of the opposite and more people are
upgrading to this architecture faster than the Pascal architecture?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, great. So let me ﬁrst start with a reminder. Remember this discussion
presentation, we may contain forward-looking statements and investors are advised
to read our reports ﬁled with the SEC for information related to risks and
uncertainties facing our business.
But let's get into your question regarding gaming, and our 25% of our installed base
that is on RTX. When we indicate that RTX is 25% of our installed base, we're
referring to two architectures with that. Ampere is our second generation, Turing was
our ﬁrst and we've reached 25% of them, we believe in our estimates are now able to
play Ray Trace games on the platforms that they have.
Adoption of a speciﬁc generation of an architecture generally tops out at
approximately 50% of the installed base. But again, that can vary from architecture-
to-architecture. So a portion of our installed base will purchase the current
architecture, but some may await new generation before upgrading. And this is
particularly common, for example, in the lower end of our portfolio. When we
transition to new architecture, it's common that we are both selling the new
architecture and the prior architecture at the same time.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
Got it. You're seeing what -- I think what's diﬀerentiated with this architectures is the
RTX capabilities that are coming to the titles, such as in Marvel's Guardians of Galaxy
or EA's Battleﬁeld 2042. So can you give us a sense of how Ray Tracing has really
changed the dynamic of gaming and how that's been spurring more adoption of the
Ampere architecture?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Ray Tracing when we began with the Turing architecture really fueled not only
the availability of the compute, but fueled the entire ecosystem to be focusing on
probably something that they were not expecting for probably a decade going
forward. So our results have started the ecosystem as a whole. Ray tracing is now
really the next technology movement that we're seeing with the games that are
being built. Games that were in process or new games that are being built, really
take advantage of Ray Tracing. But it's more than that, because Ray Tracing can be
helpful and useful for industries even outside of gaming.
It's important for those that are broadcasting games, those that are training others in
terms of on the use of GeForce for their games, but more importantly, it's also
moving to enterprise. Enterprise applications using Ray Tracing can also really assess
both the production of products, that overall true visible view in real-time has beenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-10

A - Colette Kresshelpful. So Ray Tracing is an important piece today. But again, we'll see more and
more applications of even outside of gaming as we work forward.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
With gaming continuing to perform well, what is the latest you're seeing in terms of
product availability for gamers? And if we could maybe split that between the
Cerium and the crypto miner demand, maybe an update there in terms of what
you're seeing with respect to your low hash rates GPU that you speciﬁcally sent out
for Ethereum. And just wanted to get a sense in terms of how you're balancing the
supply for gamers?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So even throughout all of calendar 2021, we have seen strong demand for
GeForce. And it continues to remain strong and stronger than our overall supply that
we have. The holiday demand, for example, was quite strong, particularly in laptops.
And we're still ﬁnishing out our quarter. But we'll look at the end of the quarter in
terms of what we've seen in terms of channel levels. We had seen channel levels be
quite lean, and we are working with our supply chain partners to increase the
availability of supply. And we feel better about our supply situation as we move into
the second half of the calendar year '22.
Some of the other record breaking things that we've seen is gaming demand is quite
strong. We're seeing record concurrent users, for example, on Steam, 28 million
concurrent users breaking a prior record quite easily. Also, we're seeing momentum
build -- momentum building for creative and/or Metaverse like type of applications
that are addressed with our Studio oﬀerings, but also Omniverse.
Now when we focus in terms of cryptocurrency, the contribution of cryptocurrency to
our gaming revenue continues and will be diﬃcult for us to quantify. We believe that
our process on light hash rate cards for GeForce, also with our CMP product, has
been an eﬀective strategy to steer GeForce to the supply within the gamers.
However, new crypto hash rate has stemmed and we're seeing several diﬀerent
sources of that. That can be our GeForce GPUs, it could be AMD GPUs, custom
ASICs, and our CMP product, all of these are contributing, but again, it's just very
diﬃcult for us to quantify.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
So just kind of sticking with that, I appreciate the fact that the company has
implemented a low hash rate, GeForce GPU and also a CMP speciﬁc processor for
crypto in order to somehow distinguish between gamers and crypto. That's been in
place for the last, say, several months. What have you seen as a result of those kind
of new two initiatives? Have you been able to better distinguish between the
demand, between the gamers and the crypto? And have you also been able to take
advantage of that understanding to allocate supply a bit more eﬃciently as we go
into 2022?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-10
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 13Q - Rajvindra Gill
A - Colette KressYeah, so let's ﬁrst start with our ﬁrst part of our process, the CMP product, which
stands for Crypto Mining Processor. This is speciﬁcally enabling the ability to do hash
rates on a product that does not have overall video capabilities, or another way of
saying that, it can't be used for overall gaming. We geared that toward our crypto
miners, and sold into professional miners on that, strong quarters. So we felt that was
contributing to what we are seeing in terms of the hash rate increases.
Now our light hash rate, we've pretty much for all of our upcoming Ampere products
as they reach market, incorporate that light hash rate. What that can do is that can
decrease the overall hash eﬃciency by up to 50%. And so that's a deterrent in terms
of those that are trying to buy a GeForce cards and looking to do that for crypto. It
may be very diﬃcult for them to be eﬀective in terms of their work with crypto. It's
unclear we can't get quite quantitative in terms of how successful all of these, but we
do know that these two overall strategies have been helpful in the market as we're
seeing more moved statements at this time.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
Got it. If we could switch gears to the data center business, data center business,
another signiﬁcant revenue contributor, the most recent quarter was up 55% year-
over-year. And it grew about 24% sequentially, third quarter, calendar third quarter.
One of the interesting things that we spoke talked about on the earnings call and
recent conferences is you're pushing to Inference. So only 10% of your servers are
accelerated. Wondering how you're thinking about Inference going into this year.
You had mentioned that roughly 25,000 companies use your Inference tools and the
new Triton server. So thoughts about how Inference is going to track, say, this year
versus last year? And what are the some of the drivers of Inference adoption on
GPUs?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Great question. So we've had great success with our Ampere architecture in the data
center. Our A100 has been very strong since the launch. And the key thing to keep in
mind about our A100 architecture is that it is allowing both hyperscales and the
vertical industries to address the demand needs that they have. But more
importantly, A100 has the ability to address deep learning, training, and inferencing
at the same time. We do have inferencing-focused GPUs. And this has also been
quite a success in terms of revenue growth of these GPUs has outpaced what we saw
in terms of overall data center growth in Q3, as inferencing has outgrown the CPU
and AI has been an increasingly important component of how they are doing
inferencing.
Now going forward, it will be diﬃcult for us to understand that mix in terms of how
much it would be training and how much is inferencing, because A100 architectures
do allow both, meaning you can redeploy A100 many ways, all for training, training
plus inferencing, at the same time. So we just won't have that perfect understanding.
But our work with customers, helping them with their inferencing solutions, helping
them in terms of training, training models, as well as all of the diﬀerent software that
we have enabled for these industries, really speak to the growth that we're going to
see in terms of the industry going forward.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-10

When you mentioned based on your estimate that 10%, only 10% of the servers are
actually accelerated, that means 90% are CPU-based. When you are penetrating into
this market, are you seeing customers go directly to the A100, to do both training
and inference? Are you seeing kind of more inference-based speciﬁc GPUs? Does it
vary by application? Is there any trend lines that you can kind of maybe talk about, as
you kind of penetrate further into the inference market, and try to capitalize on that
growth?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah, so great question. When we focused on what type of metric do you want to
look at. And we ﬁrst started indicating that we're still in the early stage of penetrating
the server market with acceleration. More than just saying it's only 10%, it really
indicates that there is 90% opportunity still going forward, as people really see the
importance of acceleration going forward, as Moore's Law becomes at an end for
many of these applications.
Now what we see in terms of how they're purchasing, it depends in terms of where
they are going to do that type of computing. It could be in the cloud. It could be on
premise, it could be with a colo, there's many diﬀerent opportunities. The A100 has
enabled both setting up in the cloud and that easy adoption to have multi-tenancy.
But there aren't times when people are also going to the cloud to just have
inference-speciﬁc GPU that they could be on. Now whether or not they stay in the
cloud, take that to on-premise, as we move forward, we'll see more of it.
What we were really fueling was easy adoption, easy adoption to focus solely in the
cloud. Do you want it on premise? Do you want to work with an overall colo? So
these are many diﬀerent options that we have, not only in terms of the hardware and
system infrastructure, but also the software stacks that we have enabling that.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
That's really helpful to understand that process. You also broke out the data center
revenue, 50% cloud, 50% enterprise, 1% supercomputing or 49%, that equals to
100%. So you saw vertical industries, particularly led by consumer Internet and cloud
providers, really seeing a lot of growth. Wondering Colette, if you can maybe talk
about, what are some of the adoption trends that you're seeing across the diﬀerent
verticals, the diﬀerent hyperscalers? Any kind of interesting use cases that are really -
- highlight the importance of your A100 and your whole AI GPU suite?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. So when we think about our data center revenue and our customer proﬁle, we
split it about 50/50. 50% is focused on those hyper scales, 50% is our enterprise
industry verticals that we're seeing. Keep in mind the hyperscale, some of that can
be used for their internal use, in terms of building applications that they monetize.
But the other portion of it is setting up cloud instances. Those cloud instances are an
important area for us to bring on developers, researchers, higher education, but alsoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-10
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 13Q - Rajvindra Gill
A - Colette Kresssome of the ﬁrst places where the enterprise industry has gone to also test those
places. They may be there permanently.
And then yes, we have a small percentage that is also on supercomputing. But our
work in terms of AI as a whole has driven a strong presence with both the
hyperscalers and the industries piece of that. Now what we see in terms of the type
of work that they're doing, what's changed over the last three to four years, if I can
be very honest that, we were seeing computer vision or looking at pictures,
classifying pictures. And some of the early days of AI, where we have is some of the
big models and the focus has been on natural language understanding, natural
language processing, through all of the same work that they have been doing,
whether that be search types of commands or in the case of consumer Internet
companies, they are working on recommendative, recommendative engines that
help them monetize all of the Internet marketing and focus that they're doing. So it's
a big area to using AI to determine how to reach these overall customer sets.
Those are some of the ﬁrst areas that we focused on with the overall hyperscale
consumer Internet. But keep in mind, our software applications are focused,
meaning our software development kits tying into so many of the enterprise
applications has been also a big area of focus. Financial industries, for example, use
AI to avoid fraud and work on AI solutions so that they could detect that. Retail focus
in terms of AI to improve their overall forecasting of supply and demand. But also
thinking about how to better stock what they have in the actual stores that are
checkouts as well. So many diﬀerent options there are.
High performance computing continues to be accelerated in many, many areas.
That's been an area that we've focused on for more than 10 to 15 years. And then the
ability to infuse AI into that process to again, move a lot faster in the work that they
are doing. So many diﬀerent areas, our work in software, and a full stack to help
them rethink their applications and focus on AI. Post the pandemic we think more of
this will ﬂow as people really understand the use of AI will be a competitive need for
their industries.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
Thanks for that, Colette. If we could switch gears to the capacity situation, you had
made pre-payments of about $1.6 billion that were dispersed thus far to a major
foundry partner, with the future expected to be a total of $3.4 billion. This should
ensure that NVIDIA has ample capacity on relevant nodes to meet your targets. But
wanted to get a sense of, can you discuss what kind of products, what kind of nodes
that this prepayment capacity that is being targeted at and how has that process
been so far as you move into the account in 2022?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So when we look at our process right now of securing supply, I don't think there is
anybody in the semiconductor industry and/or the systems that is not focused on
long-term supply, long-term supply, as well as what we need every single quarter for.
So if you've watched our overall focus in terms of supply even over this last year, yes,
we continue to try and get more supply for the latest and greatest quarter. But at theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-10
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 13Q - Rajvindra Gill

Q - Rajvindra Gill
A - Colette Kresssame time we are procuring supply commitments for longer-term. Many cases they
can be for a year out, some of the times they may be for multiple years out.
Now when we indicate that we're securing supply, given that we are a full systems
company, in many cases, it is everything from foundries, everything to components,
things in terms of packaging, focused in terms of testing capabilities or just sheer
capacity to complete the building out of our overall system. So there's a wide range
of diﬀerent capacity agreements we've done. And yes, some of them have been
helpful that we have prepaid in advance for some of those. But our focus, again, is to
be helping the ecosystem, helping our suppliers, understand where we think
demand may go, so that we can secure this and help them as they go about this
capacity going forward.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
The shift to come to longer-term supply agreements, based on your experience in
the industry, is this up -- is this a ﬁrst, that -- is this a new dynamic that's been
happening in the industry in general?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I believe it has existed in a smaller amount in history. But the sheer volume of what
we're seeing of folks needing to procure for the longer time is essential. Not
everybody has all that perfect visibility on what may be needed. And we're just
going to run short, if we are not sharing information, helping all of our suppliers in
the ecosystem understand. We do this every day right now making up the quarter.
It's not just about what we can provide in terms of a GPU. We have to think through
the entire system, the system of building a laptop, or workstation, or for example, the
DGX, will all of those components and pieces be available? How do we help fuel the
full ecosystem? So yes, I think we are turning into a new wave that I believe will be
helpful in terms of the overall working together.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
Just to follow-up on the supply, this is really a question from investors. So on the
supply, is it fair to assume that you feel conﬁdent that you'll have enough supply to
meet the data center demand as well as on the graphic demand? Any kind of details
or more insights in terms of how the supply is being allocated for each of the main
end markets?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. So today, if we look our demand exceeds supply in some of our businesses.
We've indicated that demand exceeds supply, for example, in gaming and there's
parts of our data center business, in the focused networking, that has also been
constrained. We are working, as we've mentioned, in terms of longer-term, getting
that supply. In the second half of calendar '22, we believe we'll be in a great position
with our overall supply in terms of our estimations of what we will need going
forward. So still some time to be assured that we can work through supply. We do
still have a plan to grow, of course, through these quarters going forward. But in the
second half of ﬁscal year '22 -- in the second half of calendar '22.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-10

You'll be in a "great position with respect to supply".
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We hope to be. That is correct.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
You hope to be.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Well, demand has surprised us and strong demand. But right now, we do believe we
will be in a good position.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
Got it. And just on the networking demand, it has outpaced your ability to supply as
you mentioned. Can you explain, why this is happening and which of your products
up here are in particularly high demand with? And any particular customers that you
can talk about on the networking side?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah, our networking solutions are world class. And they -- just as we are building
out the data center for AI, they are an important integral part in terms of data center
build out. So it's actually not one speciﬁc product. But the products keep in mind are
full systems and putting together those systems with components. Sometimes
certain areas have fallen short. So we are working on it feverishly. And we do hope it
to improve as well in the second half of the calendar year.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
Got it. So just shifting to Omniverse, and the 3D world, so this is a huge opportunity. I
think it came as a bit of a surprise to investors in the middle of last year, is another
kind of leg to your growth story that wasn't necessarily anticipated. So your
Omniverse enterprise is a platform that for simulating physically accurate 3D worlds,
and you make it easier to integrate computer vision, speech recognition, natural
language, understanding and processing, facial animation, all the diﬀerent
constructs of data and you can kind of run this in real time.
So wanted to get your thoughts in terms of who are you seeing as the early adopters
of this Omniverse platform, the Avatar platform? Are there any undergoing testing
deployment at this time? And I'll just stop there, and we can kind of maybe delve a
little bit deeper into that. I just want to get a sense.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-10
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 13Q - Rajvindra Gill
A - Colette KressSure. Let's talk about the Omniverse products that we have available. It is a both
software and hardware oﬀering with services as well. So the Omniverse software
opportunity can be looked at in two main ways that we will plan to directly monetize.
First, in terms of design collaboration. We're talking about collaboration of building
products, anything from building a coke bottle, to building a skyscraper, or next
airplane type.
The key thing in terms of that collaboration is looking at it in terms of the productivity
docs, documents that are necessary for that 3D. It addresses the 40 million diﬀerent
designers and possible users that are out there. We will monetize it, what we refer to
it as Omniverse enterprise. We'll look at a pricing of about $1,000 per seat per year.
And that is currently available in general availability. So we see enterprises, one of
key enterprises that we started to showcase that was quite far along in our journey,
and have been working with us with many years, someone like BMW, really thinking
of manufacturing ﬂoor and how they can improve the overall collaboration.
But digital BOTs is another way, another way to assist for customer support, call
centers, in car systems, a also large opportunity. The Omniverse avatar, for example,
can be priced at something similar to $1,000 per Avatar per year. And this is overall
in beta.
Now our software revenues will have a multiple level, will have a multiple systems
and chips revenue that will come with that, whether that be workstations and/or
building out 3D virtual world models in the data center. We believe this will be a
meaningful revenue contributor over the next few years. Already starting to see
some of these Metaverses get started. Content creators, cloud gaming, infrastructure
is another example. And enterprises are quite interested in the digital twin
environment.
So what we're seeing in terms of those applications of the technology are wide
ranging. But we've highlighted three use cases in the near term, for example, Project
Tokkio for customer support. You'll see for example, NVIDIA DRIVE Concierge, this
could be the AI assistant inside of the car you're driving. Tell me where the nearest
Starbucks is, or the nearest gas station, or (inaudible) in terms of using for video
conferencing in 3D world. So the interest is high. But as we continue, we'll be happy
to update you on our progress in the upcoming quarters.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
Does this require kind of additional resources with respect to new software
development or hardware development? Or is this something that you can
essentially leverage your existing software framework, your existing hardware
framework into this new opportunities?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We've been working on Omniverse for several years, if you've watched our DTC,
some of those early motion things that we had displayed was Omniverse coming to
life. But one of the other things that we do, whether it be any software development
kit or Omniverse, is we are here to connect with existing applications. There areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-10
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 13Q - Rajvindra Gill

A - Colette Kressmany applications that are used in the design world, from Adobe to Autodesk, to
Blender, a huge host of them. And so part of the announcements of Omniverse was
really our engagement with those diﬀerent applications. So the end user is still using
those applications, but it's connecting with Omniverse that takes their 2D world into
a 3D or a virtual world.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
For the broader suite of Omniverse products, is there a way to estimate the market
size? You mentioned some of the price points for the 3D designers. Any sense of
how you're kind of roughly estimating the market potential?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We are still -- give you some highlights in the near-term going forward in terms of
maybe a little bit more information about what this opportunity is. But we know it is a
multi-billion dollar opportunity in front of us. We have several new multi-billion dollar
opportunities that have services to last time that we provided overall TAM. So stay
tuned with our Investor Day. In March, we'll give you some more information.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
And just want to switch gears to the automotive segment. This is another massive
growth opportunity for NVIDIA that has taken a bit of a while to ramp, but I think is
going to be ramping the next couple of years. So you mentioned an $8 billion
autonomous pipeline recently, which is expected to launch in the second half of
calendar '22. And which products are being launched ﬁrst, and for which
applications?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So we did announce an $8 billion pipeline to help folks understand that
currently today in our automotive business, our automotive business focused on
many years of working with the OEMs on infotainment systems, a graphic
infotainment systems that are inside in cars, and that is still part of our business. But
for over the last 5 to 10 years, we've been also focusing on that transformation of
moving towards EV. And we've of course approached EV diﬀerently than many of
our competitors. We believe that AI computing is really necessary. And most of the
OEMs have also really understood the importance of that, that, that makes them ﬁne
tune exactly what they want to provide for those passenger cars experience, but also
provides you experience that last over the length of owning the car.
We have an $8 billion pipeline that takes us out to 2027. That includes folks, such as
passenger car OEMs, it also includes Robotaxis. It includes the trucking industry that
is also very interested in using it.
So moving into the second half of this calendar year, we will start to begin working
into that pipeline. That pipeline will focus a lot in terms of the new energy customers
that are building cars, electric cars, and are starting with a platform from grounds up.
They understand and truly appreciate what we can provide with DRIVE and provide
with our high carrier platform that enables them to continue to build in a new way forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-10

A - Colette Kressthe cars going forward. So you'll see that and you will also see some of the starts of
other types of companies advancing there.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
But it's fair to assume that towards the end of this year, and going into calendar '23,
that we should start to see kind of a shift away from infotainment, or not a shift away,
but in addition to infotainment, the more in some of these other applications that
NVIDIA has been working on for quite some time. The markets seems to be kind of
coming to fruition. Just a couple of questions on auto and then I kind of move to
margin and then we'll wrap up.
So in automotive NVIDIA DRIVE and the related Concierge and Chauﬀeur they're
gaining traction. Can you give us a rundown of what makes DRIVE beneﬁcial to
various parties, and with which adopters is it currently gaining the most traction?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure, so DRIVE, so keep in mind is an end-to-end platform for creating these
automated driving solutions. It can start with just the development of AI. We may
provide them DGXs that are working with their engineers. The important piece of
that is that comes with a software platform to assist them in terms of their work.
Another important part of automated driving is that simulation, that testing, that
validation. This is again where Omniverse simulation is an important piece of that
work. If you think about it, trying to travel the world in a car in all of the roads to
make sure that autonomated driving solutions will work will be very diﬃcult, because
you're looking for that one time of a very special circumstance to see how it works.
Well, you can simulate that back in your data centers with Omniverse. And that has
been extremely helpful in pushing forward for the safety of being on the roads.
Additionally, we, of course, oﬀer the in-car AI compute and sensor suite as well. This
is a Hyperion product. Now, each of our customers choose and decide what parts of
this that they want to support and diﬀerent types of design that they want. And
having them take advantage of all the diﬀerent oﬀerings that we have from an end-
to-end component. When we think about who is interested, it can be current
passenger car OEM builders, the Tier 1s are very interested, for example, on the
Hyperion new platform that enables them to think about that platform over many
years of the new cars. Robotaxis, startups, trucking, all of these types of cars have
been interested.
But you're correct. We've also added new pieces of Omniverse, very speciﬁc for
automotive, ﬁrst, starting with DRIVE Concierge. DRIVE Concierge uses that drive
technology, and an Omniverse Avatar. They work together with DRIVE Chauﬀeur, for
example. The Concierge serves as everyone's digital system, as you're inside of the
car, making recommendations, booking reservations, making phone calls and
providing alerts. The key thing of the AI is it uses natural language understanding
together for that solution.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-10

Q - Rajvindra GillDRIVE Chauﬀeur, the last piece of our Omniverse really helps with that burden of
controlling the vehicle and monitoring the surrounding environment. It's that help
that you have inside of the car of walking for all the stuﬀ the driver should be aware
about. So we have full stack available for the car companies, and we're really excited
for this year (Technical Diﬃculty) some of these.

Very interesting. We just have a couple of minutes left. So just want to hit gross
margins. And then we'll wrap it up. So the margins have moved massively over the
last several quarters -- several years. You've guided to about 67% gross margin for
January. You have -- you're building a software platform for the Omniverse revenue
stream that you want to monetize. There's a lot of software you're selling with respect
to high-end GPUs and also on workstation. How do we think about -- how are you
thinking about the margins, over the next couple of years with respect to revenue? Is
there more drivers of margin? Or do you want to kind of maintain it at this level? It's
a very fundamental question with respect to NVIDIA stock pricing and the valuation
is how are you kind of thinking about that?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Well, when we think about the history of the company, we probably got oﬀ the train
that was focusing on chip sales many years ago. We are a company that is focused
on systems and platforms and software is not new to us. Software is a large
component in terms of the reason why people choose our platform, not necessarily
software monetized separately, the software that enabled the ability for them to
deploy these platforms.
Now when we think about gross margin and our successive gross margin, it really
has been a focus on that mix. As folks move to our higher-end platforms, our
platforms that enable so much development software work already, that has been
beneﬁcial to our gross margins. And going forward, software, software monetization
will also be a driver of the market. We believe that we right now in terms of in the
high 60s, are quite stable in terms of those and we'll see how software continues to
take oﬀ if we monetize it separately and helping us as well [ph].
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
Right, we'll leave it at that. Thank you so much, Colette, I really appreciate it. Thank
you, everyone for joining us and best of luck for the rest of the year.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So thank you so much for having us. Appreciate it.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
Anytime. Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-10
