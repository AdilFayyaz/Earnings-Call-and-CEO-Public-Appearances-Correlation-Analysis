Hi, everyone. We're going to get started. Welcome to Tesla's 2017 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders. My name is Todd Maron, I'm Tesla's General Counsel. Following the
formal part of the meeting, we'll welcome Elon Musk up onto the stage. In addition,
I'd like to introduce several other people who are here with us today. We have our
whole Board of Directors up in front; along with our CFO, Deepak Ahuja; we have
our VP of Investor Relations, Jeﬀ Evanson.
There are 2 parts to today's meeting. First, the formal part of the meeting. We'll
cover the 5 items that we've asked stockholders to vote on today. And after the
voting, Elon will provide a presentation. At the end of his presentation, we will take
the questions that we asked for on Twitter yesterday. We got thousands of questions
and Elon will answer many of them.
Okay. I'm now going to call Tesla's Annual Stockholder Meeting to order. Please
refer to the agenda and rules of the meeting that were provided to you today. The
time is now -- something -- 2:40 p.m. And the polls are now open. We've already
received, over the past few weeks, voting proxies from our stockholders, meaning
that almost all of the votes have already been counted, although some of you also
vote today and those will be counted as well.
As I mentioned previously, if you wish to pick up a ballot, there's a table over there
and you can grab one and then you'll want to hand it to Lisa Brenten from
Computershare.
Tesla's Board of Directors has appointed Lisa to serve as Inspector of Elections for
this meeting. She has taken and signed an oath as Inspector of Election.
Computershare has certiﬁed that, starting on April 20, 2017, the proxy materials or aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-06

Page 2 of 17Aeisha Mastagninotice of Internet availability of the proxy materials were mailed or provided to all
stockholders of record as of April 13, 2017.
We have a majority of the outstanding shares represented at the meeting. So there's
a quorum present and we can proceed with the meeting. The items on the agenda
are as follows: number one, the election of 3 Class I directors, Elon Musk, Robyn
Denholm and Steve Jurvetson, to serve for a term of three years or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualiﬁed; number two, a nonbinding
advisory vote on the approval of executive compensation; number three, a
nonbinding advisory vote on the frequency of executive compensation votes;
number four, to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers as Tesla's
independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for the ﬁscal year ending December
31, 2017. Tesla's board has recommended that our stockholders vote for each of the
director nominees, for the approval of executive compensation, three years as the
frequency of executive compensation voting and for the ratiﬁcation of the
appointment of our accounting ﬁrm.
Finally, we've also received a stockholder proposal as described in our proxy
statement. Our board has recommended that our stockholders vote against this
proposal. The stockholder proposal is proposed by the Connecticut Retirement
Plans and Trust Funds, whose designee, Aeisha Mastagni, is here to present the
proposal. Ms. Mastagni, where are you? Here you are. You can come up and you'll
have a few minutes to present your proposal.
{BIO 17575347 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, members of the board and fellow shareholders,
thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. My name is Aeisha Mastagni.
And I'm a Portfolio Manager in the Corporate Governance Unit of the California State
Teachers' Retirement System. I am presenting Proposal #5 on behalf of the
Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Fund. And sponsor of the proposal; and
Connecticut State Treasurer, Denise Nappier. The Connecticut pension plan holds
approximately 34,537 shares of Tesla's stock.
I hereby move the proposal, which asks the board to take the necessary steps,
excluding those steps that must be taken by shareholders, to eliminate the
classiﬁcation of Tesla's board and to require that all directors stand for election
annually. Tesla's board is currently classiﬁed, which means that, each year, only a
portion of directors are elected by shareholders. This year, shareholders have the
opportunity to vote for 3 of Tesla's 7 directors. Classiﬁed boards hamper the ability
of shareholders to hold directors accountable. In our view, annual accountability
serves to keep directors closely focused on the performance of top executives and
on increasing shareholder value. Moreover, academic studies have found that
classiﬁed boards are associated with lower ﬁrm value, poor pay for performance.
And greater likelihood of value-destroying acquisitions.
Classiﬁed boards are increasingly rare, especially among larger companies.
Accordingly to the 2017 ISS Board Practices Study, over 65% of S&P 1500 companiesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-06
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 3 of 17Todd A. Maron
Elon R. Muskand almost 90% of S&P 500 companies elect all directors annually. Tesla's board has
changed little since it went public. Founder Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal Musk, serves
on the board, as do 3 directors with business ties to Elon Musk. Only 1 of those
directors is standing for reelection at today's meeting, which means shareholders'
ability to express their views about board composition and director relationships --
that may compromise independence.
Tesla claims in its statement in opposition that declassifying the board would impair
Tesla's ability to undertake long-term initiatives and create shareholder value. Tesla
cites no data in support of that assertion and the only data which we are aware to tell
a diﬀerent story. A 2009 study in the Financial Analysts Journal found that U.S. public
companies with classiﬁed boards invested less in research and development and
other company-speciﬁc capital assets than companies with declassiﬁed boards. Even
for R&D-intensive companies and those in industries where technology played a key
role, like semiconductors, aircraft and space vehicles, companies with declassiﬁed
boards invested a signiﬁcantly higher portion of assets in R&D and created 22%
more value for shareholders than companies with classiﬁed boards. We urge
shareholders to support this proposal.
{BIO 18879554 <GO>}
I'd like to remind our stockholders that Tesla's board has prepared a statement in
opposition to the proposal and that appears in our proxy statement.
All right. Before we wrap up, are there any proxies remaining in the audience that
have not been submitted? If so, now is the time to submit them in order for them to
be counted. If you have one, please raise your hand and we'll have people come
and grab them. Try to hold them up high. Thanks.
Okay, I don't see any more hands. One hand. One more hand. Can we get one
person to come up in the front?
Okay. I declare that the polls are now closed. As I mentioned earlier, we did receive
almost all of the votes before the meeting started. And based on the proxies that we
received, I can announce that our shareholders have approved the
recommendations of Tesla's board on all 5 of the agenda items. We will formally
announce the results of the voting by ﬁling a Form 8-K within 4 business days of
today's meeting.
That concludes the oﬃcial part of today's shareholder meeting, which is now
adjourned. We can now move on to Elon's presentation, which I promise you, will be
more interesting.

Hi, everyone. Well welcome. I'm glad to see you, too. I always love these shareholder
meetings. I mean, I tell people I like doing the shareholder meeting and it's like,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-06
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 4 of 17man, it always feels like a party and I love seeing you guys. And it's like -- and they're
like, "Really? That's not like normal shareholder meetings."
So I want to go through the kind of a high-level overview. I think it's been a really
great year for Tesla and I think there's even better years to come. And so I'm going
to talk about that and then try to answer -- I think there's 20 questions that we have
on the list that were submitted via Twitter. There's certainly some really interesting
questions that were submitted and some interesting correlations that were drawn.
We couldn't get to them all. But we'll try to get to, I think, the 20 that I think are most
signiﬁcant for the year ahead of us.
So really the -- one of the key things that happened this year is the beginning of the
transition of Tesla to a fully integrated sustainable energy company, where you have
solar creating energy, then the stationary battery pack, the Powerwall and Powerpack
storing the energy. And then that energy being used in an electric vehicle.
Now the great thing about this is it answers all -- it's a fully contained energy solution
that could scale for the whole world. I don't -- get into that for a moment. But it's
something where you can imagine as far in the future, well beyond human
civilization, which I hope lasts a really long time, that this is something that would last
for really -- this is -- this works. And I think there are no unanswered questions. Even
in the Gigafactory or the Gigafactories that make these products will be powered by
sustainable energy.
So like, I really don't think there's any hole left in the argument. Because when we
were making electric cars, people would say that, well, they're just really coal-
powered. And there's like the long tailpipe -- there were tailpipes really over there by
the power plant. And we're like, yes. But we're going to have sustainable energy
generation too and then -- but then you cancel out gasoline cars. So you're going to
have electric cars, sustainable energy production. And then you've got to store that
energy because the sun don't shine at night. Real simple, 1, 2, 3. That's been
amazingly diﬃcult to explain this. I'm like, there's only 3 pictures there, man. I'm like, I
mean, come on.
So with the solar roof, we really try to address, at the residential level, I think one of
the fundamental inhibitions of adding solar, which is aesthetics. People love their
homes. They want their homes to be beautiful. And if you've got a sloped-roof home,
that means you have to have solar integrated into the roof itself. And so what we've
created here, I think, is something that's going to be incredibly revolutionary, where
it's beautiful. In fact, I think it looks better than a normal roof. In doing this, we were
trying to ﬁnd examples of roofs. And it's like, man, take a look at roofs next time
you're driving down the road. You're like, whoa, they're not good.
So this is a roof that's going to be better-looking than a normal roof. It's going to last
practically forever. Like, I wanted to have an inﬁnite-year warranty. But then the
ﬁnance department said, "Well that's diﬃcult to account for." So I said, "Well okay. It's
inﬁnite or when your house falls down, whichever comes ﬁrst." You'll get the bestFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-06
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 5 of 17request. [ph] But basically, it's going to last forever. You think of it like a cathedral
with stained glass windows. Those stained-glass windows are about the only thing --
and the stone walls -- the only thing that's lasted over half a millennium.
So great-looking, durable, aﬀordable when you consider the cost of a roof and the
cost of electricity from the utility. And this is going to vary quite a lot by region. So it
depends on what property taxes are, what the cost of ﬁnancing is and what the cost
of power from the utility is. But we're conﬁdent that this is going to be something
that is -- either it actually makes you money or is close to breakeven for most of the
country, which I think is really profound.
Now there's still a very important role for the traditional kind of ﬂat-panel solar. And
so that's still going to be a very important part of our business going forward,
because whenever you've got a ﬂat roof situation, which is most commercial
installations are ﬂat roofs. And -- or if you've got a residence that's got a ﬂat roof and
it's not visible from the street, then there's no need to go with the solar glass tiles
because aesthetics are no longer a factor. You can't see it.
So let's -- I just want to emphasize that traditional solar is still going to be a very
important part of the business going forward. Also, if somebody has got a brand-
new roof, they probably don't want to replace the roof right away and it's still going
to make sense to have retroﬁt solar.
And these are the -- where you're seeing cycling through are the kind of the ﬁrst 4.
We're starting oﬀ with 2, which is the kind of the black slate and the textured slate.
Then, hopefully, by early next year, we'll be in production with the Spanish-style and
the French slate versions. And there will be more over time.
But the overarching goal here is to have a set of products -- or a set of roof products
where, if you were driving through a neighborhood and you looked at the roofs, you
say, like, "Wow. I really like the way those roofs look." Roofs don't get a lot of
attention. But we want something -- we want to create -- it's like, if you can imagine
the future and what it looks like, that, that's something that you want.
And obviously, that needs to be paired with stationary storage, with a battery pack.
The battery packs are important for a number of reasons and they -- because the
solar power obviously peaks during the middle of the day and then it's low at dawn
and dusk and it's not there at night. So it needs something that is load-leveling the
power. So it's storing it when there's high power generation, releasing it when you
have low power generation. And this is going to be important for grid stability as
solar scales. So as there's more and more solar, it's more and more critically
important that there be batteries to load-level the grid and enable a full transition to
sustainable energy.
So the -- and then it has a great advantage, which, I think it's this kind of thing where
only you really notice it when the power is out. Like, if there are frequent power
outages because a substation went down or a bird ﬂew into wires, or in many partsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-06
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 6 of 17of the world, power is intermittent and they have to have generators, which run on
very expensive diesel fuel. But even here in California, we know we're due for the big
one, that it's been saving up. So there's going to be earthquakes in California.
There'll be hurricanes in the Southeast. There'll be ice storms in the Northeast.
There's ﬂoods, there's all sorts of things that cause electricity interruption. And we're
very dependent on electronic devices.
So people might say, "Well it's not a problem. I'll call 911." Well how are you going to
do that if your phone is dead? Okay, that's real hard. And if all your devices are gone
because of a power outage, we're so dependent on devices these days that it's
actually a signiﬁcant safety and security concern.
So the nice thing about having the Powerwall, particularly Powerwall 2, is that it's like
having an uninterruptible power supply for your house. And like I say, it's like buying
insurance. It's sort of like the kind of thing that when you need it, you really need it.
And so I think that's an important advantage that is sometimes overlooked.
And we've got the Powerpack side. This is for big utility scale installations, as well as I
should point out, a very important market, which is commercial and industrial. So
we've done some of the biggest -- in fact, maybe I think the biggest -- still the
biggest battery installation in the world in Southern California. And that took over
from what was a natural gas peaker. And that's an operation that's doing well.
We've got a huge system in Hawaii, in Kauai, which is responsible for 20% of Kauai's
peak power generation. Then we've got a system in American Samoa, which powers
the whole island, that's totally oﬀ grid. And I think that's a great example of what the
-- of the potential. Because in the limit, a continent is a big island, okay? There's this
big island. But it's called a continent. If you can make -- if you take an island and have
that completely run on solar and batteries, you can do that with a continent. So the
potential there, I think, is incredibly exciting.
And now with the latest version of the phone app, integrated the Powerwall and
solar with the Tesla app. So now you can see on your -- in Tesla's list of products, no
longer is the list just vehicles. It says products. And now you can see the Powerwall is
on there and solar. So you can see the status of your Powerwall. You can see whether
your solar system is functioning well, how much energy you're producing. It will
show you how much energy you're producing, how much is being stored, how much
is being consumed and then how that relates to the car. And so you have a really
well integrated system that combines solar storage and your vehicle. And I think
there will be a few other things in the future that maybe people aren't expecting as
well.
So you can see your energy usage during the day. So you can tell if maybe you
should be turning oﬀ certain devices or reprogramming your air-conditioning
system. And it gives you a good idea of, like, where you're using power that you may
not even realize that you're using.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-06
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 7 of 17And if you are drawing energy from the grid, it'll tell you how much energy you drew
from the grid and how much you powered yourself. So I think it's -- and this
functionality is just going to get better and better. This is what's working today. So
this is not speculative. This is the current app that does this.
From the standpoint of the customer experience, we're going to make a signiﬁcant
increase in the number of retail stores we have around the world. We think we've
really barely touched the surface of what's possible on the retail side. If you just do a
back of the envelope analysis and say, in the U.S., there's about 330 million people,
how many stores per person should we have? Or how many people per store? It
seems like, probably, over time, we'd want at least 1 store for every 0.5 million
people. So that's 660 stores right there. In China, it would be thousands of stores. Or
throughout the world, there would be several thousand stores. So that's -- our plan is
to keep expanding the retail store footprint to be able to cover anyone who could
want to buy our product.
Service has gotten better and better. So we now have fast lanes in service. So the
wait times for service have gone down dramatically. It's obviously very important for
the Model 3. And we're also adding a lot more service centers in anticipation of
Model 3 production. And this year, we will double the number of Tesla
Superchargers in the world. So double year-over-year. And I think, next year,
probably, at least 50% increase, maybe double again next year.
This gives you just a sense for how many Superchargers there are in the world. It's
worth noting, this is actually the only high-speed charging network in the world.
There isn't even a second one. I asked our head of -- the head of our Supercharger
program, "Okay. Well what's the second best high-speed charging network in the
world?" And he said, "Well there's this one place in the Netherlands. But it's -- I think,
it's only like 60 or 70 kilowatts. But there's only one of it. Okay. And like, well, it
usually doesn't work." Okay. All right. All right.
Anyway, we're just going to keep growing it as fast as we can to make sure people
can go wherever they want, whenever they want, with convenience. Keep upgrading
the capability of the Supercharger system. So it can charge things faster. We're going
to start adding amenities to the Supercharger stations. So the really big stations,
we'll start adding amenities. And just make it so that you -- when you do a long-
distance trip in a Tesla, you'll love the experience. That's the overarching goal.
Then Autopilot. It's deﬁnitely been a tough slog transitioning from the Mobileye
vision chip to Tesla's internal vision system. But I think we're almost there in terms of
exceeding the ability of the Hardware 1 cars.
So Hardware 2 cars have all of the hardware necessary for full autonomy. So 8
cameras, 12 of the most advanced ultrasonic sonar sensors, a radar, a very good GPS,
an IMU. And everything necessary to go full autonomy. It's really about upgrading
the software over time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-06
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 8 of 17So I think with the next release of the software, which is maybe as soon as next week,
we will ﬁnally exceed the experience of the Hardware 1 cars and then it's going to
advance very rapidly from there. And our goal remains being able to drive
autonomously from a parking lot in California to a parking lot in New York without
touching a control at any point along the way.
So the Gigafactory is going quite well. That's I think the latest picture of the status.
Obviously, the ultimate footprint will be quite a bit bigger than what you see even
there. And it's -- we believe it will be, within a few years, have a capacity equal to all
other lithium-ion battery factories in the world combined in one building. So if you
add out of everything in the U.S., China, Europe and created everywhere else, this
one factory will output more than all of them combined.
So it's really -- just the sheer scale of this is diﬃcult to appreciate, unless you're there
in person. It is just staggeringly enormous.
That allows us to achieve high economies of scale. So that with very high production
rates. We're maximizing economies of scale, enabling us to get the lowest cost per
kilowatt hour in the world. But at the same time, have the most advanced batteries.
So the combination of the best technology at the lowest cost, I think, is just a very --
obviously, a great position to be in. And I think it's a fundamental part of Tesla's
strategy. There's just no one else who's attempting anything -- as far as we know,
even attempting anything on this scale. And so I think that puts us in a very strong
competitive position to sustain the growth of the company for several years to come.
Then over time, there will be several Gigafactories. I think, eventually, 10 or 12, maybe
20. I don't know. A lot. So it's like a giant machine. So we'll keep reﬁning this and
productizing it and then building Gigafactories around the world.
An important thing that we're making progress on is factory safety. So far this year,
Tesla is 32% below the automotive industry injury rate. And that trend is better and
better with each passing month. So I think we're on track to be less than half the
injury rate of the automotive industry and, by far, better than any other U.S. factory,
which I think is something that is extremely important.
Then we've got some future products. So the semi truck, we're going to unveil at the
end of September. And I think that's very exciting. A lot of people don't think you
can do a heavy-duty, long-range truck that's electric. But we are conﬁdent that this
can be done. So we'll be showing oﬀ a working prototype at not too long from now,
in the end of September.
And we've shown it to a number of the organizations that buy heavy-duty trucking
and they all love it. And they just want to know how many can they buy and how
soon. It's like, cool.
And we're involving them in -- thank you. And we're getting them closely involved in
the design process. So the biggest customers of the heavy-duty Tesla semi areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-06

Elon R. Muskhelping ensure that it is speciﬁed to their needs.
So it's not a mystery. They already know that it's going to meet their needs, because
they helped decide what the -- they've told us what those needs are. So it's going to
really just be a question of scaling of volume to make as many as we can.
Then Model Y. I'm really excited about Model Y. It's -- there's been some criticism,
like we should sort of derive from the Model 3 platform. But I think, actually, we
made a mistake in trying to derive the Model X from the Model S platform. It would
have been better to just design an SUV the way an SUV should be designed, design
a sedan the way a sedan should be designed. Otherwise, you're just trying to
shoehorn something in that doesn't make sense.
Also, there are a number of, I think, really major manufacturing improvements that
can be done that allow us to build the car in a way that a car has never been built
before.
The capital expenditures, I think, would be substantially less. I'm conﬁdent that we
could drop the CapEx by a factor of 2 between Model 3 and Model Y, which, I think,
is a really big deal and accelerate its readiness despite the new technologies. So
we're aiming for that to hit the roads in 2019, approximately. And probably the
demand for the Model Y will exceed the demand for the Model 3.
So -- and there's a few other things I haven't mentioned here. I've got to...
(inaudible)
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I'd just like really recommend showing up for the semi-truck unveiling. Maybe there's
a little more than we're saying here.
(inaudible)
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Maybe. Could be. Who knows?
Model 3 conﬁgurator. So we expect that conﬁgurator to go live towards the end of
next month when we deliver the ﬁrst production Model 3. So yes, we're deﬁnitely on
track to deliver the ﬁrst production Model 3 next month. That's going to be really
exciting. Then we'll have the conﬁgurator go live right at that point.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-06
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 10 of 17Now I should say that the -- we've kept the initial conﬁgurations for Model 3 very
simple. This is critical to achieving a rapid production ramp. Big mistake we made
with the X, which primarily is my responsibility, way too much complexity right at the
beginning. That was very foolish.
So we think of it like, going back to the launch of the Model S, Model S only had one
conﬁguration at the start of production. And now it had one conﬁguration because
that's all we could do, not because we were really clever. Then Model X, hubris
extraordinaire. We actually -- we added -- I mean, it is like a FabergÃ© egg of cars. I
think it's really an amazing product. But it has way too many cool things in it that
should have really been rolled in with version 2, version 3. That would have been the
sensible way to do it. We got overconﬁdent and created something great that
probably will never be made again and perhaps should not be. But it is an amazing
car. And as we keep reﬁning the software in the Model X, it's just going to get better
and better.
So initially, the Model 3 conﬁgurators, it's kind of going to be like what color do you
want and what size wheels do you want? That's basically going to be the
conﬁgurator. Then we'll show what other conﬁgure -- what other versions are coming
later as soon as we get conﬁguration one right. But they -- and with a time line
associated with each conﬁguration.
For example, we were going to start oﬀ with Dual Motor. But that's like, wait a
second, we just doubled the probability of something going wrong if we got 2
motors because they're 2 diﬀerent motor architectures. One motor is optimized for
highway travel. And one is optimized for stop and go traﬃc, which is great for
maximizing your mileage in city and maximizing your highway -- your mileage on
freeway and having incredible acceleration. But it's too much complexity right oﬀ the
bat.
So we'll just be single motor to begin with. And then we'll have the Dual Motor
conﬁg, if we're lucky, toward end of this year, more likely early next. So I wouldn't too
much about the conﬁgurator because you only have to decide like what color do
you want and what size wheels? That's basically it for initial production.
In terms of how many factories are in the works, we're really giving serious
consideration to 3 factory locations right now. But we're going to try to hold our
powder dry -- keep the powder dry until we're conﬁdent of the locations and the
timing. But like I said, ultimately, probably there's at least 10 of these worldwide and
maybe as much as 20.
How long of a wait will it be for customers wanting Model 3 who haven't placed a 1k
deposit? This will be a long wait. There's a lot of people that have ordered the car.
I'm guessing if you put a deposit down on Model 3 now, it's probably -- well, it's
going to be over a year, end of next year before you get it, something like that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-06
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 11 of 17On the other hand, we -- there are more and more deposits every week. So if you
want it, then deﬁnitely, put down the deposit. The line isn't getting shorter.
We're doing our best to do this ramp -- we got to do the ramp right. We got to make
sure the quality is good, the safety is good.
And it's crazy hard to make cars. I have to tell you. There's like 10,000 unique items
and it will move as fast as the slowest item. Then even beyond the stuﬀ that's internal
to Tesla, you say like, okay, who's the least lucky supplier we have out there? Or what
supplier cares the least or whatever the case may be? Then you look at our supply
chain and it's like, wow, our supply chain is like covering Earth. So like what are the
odds that there's going to be some force majeure events somewhere on Earth? Like
pretty high.
So one of the things I want to do with Model Y is also just simplify the supply chain
so that we're not inheriting force majeure risk from Earth, because Earth is big and if
something bad happens on Earth at any given point in time. So we're going to stop
inheriting force majeure risk from all of Earth. You can help -- you can solve this by
buﬀering parts. But if parts aren't made to begin with, you can't buﬀer them. So yes.
Are there plans in place to oﬀer battery upgrades? Yes. So we do oﬀer that already. I
wouldn't recommend doing a battery upgrade until the existing battery you have
has a fair bit of life on it. And there are some limitations because there can be a
pretty big weight diﬀerence between the lightest battery pack and the heaviest. So
we can't go from lightest to heaviest.
But we deﬁnitely can upgrade battery packs really in every car. And we will oﬀer that
and make that easier with each passing year. For somebody who's got a new battery
pack, it's not going to make ﬁnancial sense to upgrade just the battery pack. Better
to sell the car that you've got and then buy a diﬀerent one, either new or used.
And I should mention, we're going to really give more prominence to used Teslas on
our website. But we're not going to call them pre-owned. That is like a bogus name.
So-called BS. It's used, okay? Everyone knows that. Who are we fooling here?
So the used Tesla section of the website is going to get a lot more attention. And
particularly, if the car is four years old and it's got a lot of mileage, you could buy a
Model S for as much as a Model 3. It's like, well, okay, maybe somebody wants to
buy a Model S for $35,000, $40,000. And they can have that today. Then when the
Model 3 comes in, they can switch out to the Model 3, if they want. Model S is still
going to be the -- because it's a more expensive car, bigger, there's more room for
bells and whistles, it's still going to be our premium car. But anyway. So used Tesla is
going to get a lot more attention on our website. And yes.
And so what changes are being made to address safety? So this is something we're
driving really hard on every week, being with the safety team every week to say, what
can we do to make it better? And like I said, I think we're well on our way to havingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-06

Page 12 of 17an injury rate that is half that of the rest of the auto industry and way better than any
other car company.
A key change that was actually already made late last year was having 3 shifts instead
of 2. So the -- a lot of the injuries would happen when somebody whose -- had like a
10-, 11-hour day. They just get tired. And then that's when you tend to get injured. So
having 3 shifts made a huge diﬀerence to injury rate.
Then redesigning a lot of the processes to be a lot more ergonomic and improving
the ﬁxtures and tooling. There's a lot of detailed work that needs to go into avoiding
repetitive stress injuries. And -- but I'm really proud of what the safety team is doing.
And I think we're making huge progress towards being the safest automotive
company in the world.
I already talked about the semi. So I mean, timing-wise, I'm guessing that we will
probably reach scale production on the semi in about two years. Maybe 18 months
but probably about two years.
And I've already answered this. There will be continued improvements to the speed
of supercharging. Yes.
Okay. Somewhat randomly, AAA of Southern California hugely increased Tesla
insurance premiums. There is a simple solution. Change your insurance provider.
From the study we did, the average rate for insuring a Model S or a Model X is about
5% lower than other premium vehicles. And if you actually pick the right insurance
provider, it could be 20% or 30% lower.
It's just -- it's really hard to -- for there -- for death or serious injury in an S or an X,
you really have -- it's like hard to do that, okay? We literally had one person go down,
I don't know, like a 300-foot cliﬀ/ravine and they walked out of the car. So the -- and
then with automatic emergency braking, which is getting better and better as the
software improves, that actually helps a great deal with pedestrians and cyclists.
Then because the Model S and the X have such a long crumple zone, that's 2 to 3x
longer than a conventional automotive car that's got a big engine steel block in
there, it means you actually are helping even -- like even the car that you hit, the
combined crumple zone of both cars is substantially greater than if 2 gasoline cars
hit.
So it's not just you're helping safety with -- the safety is not just good for people in
the car. It actually helps if you do have a collision with another car.
Then we -- the hood is designed to be like a sort of trampoline. Now, it's not the
funniest trampoline. But again, there's no big engine block that you're going to hit.
So you can sort of -- if you do hit a pedestrian, the -- it's not a good time. But the --
essentially, the spring eﬀect of having a hood that doesn't impact a big steel engineFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-06
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 13 of 17block is -- really makes a big diﬀerence to the lives of a pedestrian if one is hit. So
yes.
Will we oﬀer a package deal? Well I guess eﬀectively, when you consider the
installation cost of the roof, the Powerwall and the home connector -- technically, it's
not a charger, it's a connector. If that's done at the same time, then you could save
$2,000 to $3,000 on installation costs of all things combined. So just by doing it at
the same time, you automatically get a reduction in cost because it's fundamentally
more eﬃcient than if 1 team visits than if 3 teams visit. Then yes. But we haven't
currently considered a package deal. But yes, maybe it's something to do in the
future. So no decision on this. But like I said, it actually will cost less if you do it at the
same time.
In terms of a new director. So we've been interviewing a number of independent
directors to add to the Tesla board. And I think we're quite close to making a
decision. And I think we will add at least 2 and maybe 3 new directors. And I think
from a broad range of backgrounds and industries. So I expect we'll probably make
that announcement in the next month or 2 at most. But I think there are really some
amazing people that will be joining the board.
Audio system insight. Yes. Actually, I was just talking about that with the team today. I
think there's quite a bit of room to improve the audio codec in the S, X and
obviously the 3. Because it is a Tesla system. So we can just reprogram it to make it
better with software. And I feel pretty conﬁdent that just with an over there -- update,
we can actually make the audio system sound quite a bit better. But it's -- I think it's a
good system. And yes, it's going to get better.
Yes. We're going to have a huge increase in the number of service centers around
the world. And for any places that are not covered by a service center, we have our
mobile repair expansion, the Tesla Rangers, will cover essentially anywhere on Earth.
For a Model 3 rollout in states that don't allow direct sales, this is maybe where we
got a lot of pushback from the dealer groups. And I mean, they say that their mode
of sales is superior. I'm like, okay, well, then why would you want a legal block if
people love it so much? It's like it doesn't make sense.
So -- but the answer is actually, you can order a Tesla in any state in the country. So
there's no limitation on ordering a car. And we can service anywhere in the country.
So actually, all you need to do is go on the website, order the car and that's it. We
can't do sales in stores in every state. But we actually sell in every state. And there are
Teslas in every state in the United States. So all you need to do is just like order it like
you're ordering something from Amazon or Apple or whatever. Just go on the
website and order it and it shows up. It's like that. Then we'll take care of service.
Really? Some of these questions, by the way, I'm seeing as you are seeing them.
What do I do for relaxing? Well it may not shock you but sports is not like a thing that
I do a lot of. I do listen to music, particularly in the car. And in terms of the musicFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-06
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 14 of 17selection, I think there's going to be some exciting announcements in terms of how -
- the music selection. I think it's very hard to ﬁnd good playlists or good matching
algorithms. We have something that works okay right now. But I think it could work
really, really great, yes.
But there will be a few -- an announcement on that later this year. I think that's going
to be -- this is going to be like the music you want to listen to. Yes. I think -- well, at
least I want to listen to it more. One of you? [ph] We'll see.
I do watch movies. I do love movies and I used to watch a lot of them. Less these
days because of work. I mean, I don't want to spend a ton of time on this question,
because like, I don't know if it's super relevant to Tesla as a company.
But I went and saw the Wonder Woman movie with my kids this weekend. That was
great. Usually, it's work more though. It's usually work more. So yes, I hang out with
my kids, see friends, normal stuﬀ. Sometimes go crazy on Twitter, yes. It's sort of
there with a little red wine, vintage record player, some Ambien, magic happens.
Are you expecting a new plant to be built for the Model Y? Yes. We are. I think the
existing Gigafactory will probably supply the -- in fact, will supply the battery pack
and drivetrains and motor and power electronics for the Model Y. But the Model Y
vehicle plant will be a new plant, essentially a new Gigafactory that we got to ﬁgure
out the exact location of. But there's just no room at Fremont. We are bursting at the
seams.
Obviously, like if I ask you like, what's their #1 complaint? It's parking. It's like, okay,
we like practically had a riot the other day for parking. And I'm like, sorry, guys.
What happens, we had a bunch of contractors come on site to install equipment for
the Model 3. And we hadn't counted on the fact that there would be 500 extra
people that showed up to install massive amounts of equipment.
So then, okay, our parking was full. So therefore, it's like a conservation of mass here,
or conservation of volume, because you -- 500 people who can't park. Anyway, it's
crazy how much parking lot is a pain in the butt.
So we're bursting at the seams in Fremont. So there's just no way we could do Model
Y at Fremont. So it's going to have to be somewhere else. And I think Fremont is just
going to be really focused on obviously S and X and then ramping up Model 3. I
think we'll even have to transfer some of the things we do at Fremont to the
Gigafactory just to allow for Model 3 expansion.
So how do I allocate my time across several companies? Yes. So I think it's very
important to appreciate that tweet frequency does not -- there's no correlation with
what I actually do for a work basis. It's like I might tweet a lot about like The Boring
Company, which is basically a hobby. It's like, I wouldn't even call that a realFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-06
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 15 of 17company at this point. It's got like 3 people, some interns and some part-time
people. We're making pretty good progress for all that. But like that's just kind of like
a fun thing to do, where there's like no pressure. Everyone thinks it's going to fail. So
it's like okay, can only go up from there. So it's like low expectations are great.
So -- but The Boring Company is maybe 2% of my time. Neuralink is 3% to 5% of my
time. OpenAI is going to be a couple of %. Then 90% plus is divided between
SpaceX and Tesla.
So depending upon -- and it's probably slightly more Tesla, because Tesla is like a
drama magnet. So it's like. So I have to deal with Tesla drama.
So -- but on average, it's probably about half of my time is between SpaceX and
Tesla. And there's a lot to be gained knowing how rockets are done and how cars
are done. In rockets, you have to deal -- work on very advanced materials, make
things superlight. And being able to translate some of that to automotive, I think, has
been very, very helpful. So it does do some good there. But I just want to emphasize
very clearly, 90% plus of my time is divided between SpaceX and Tesla. And the
remaining less than 10% is everything else.
Like I said, I'm literally seeing these questions as you are seeing them. So like -- so in
terms of, how we will have experts install solar roofs throughout the U.S.? We're --
that's actually where a huge amount of the value of the Solar City acquisition comes
in because they've installed solar on roofs almost throughout the country. And there
are thousands of diﬀerent roof types. And every jurisdiction is diﬀerent, every county,
every city. It's a really thorny, complicated, unsexy problem.
But the Solar City installation team has solved that. And so we're going to be training
the Solar City installation team to do the solar roofs, the solar glass tiles.
And the prices will come down as we are able to achieve economies of scale and
optimize the installation process. I think it's very important that we be able to kit the
entire roof before -- and then put that in a van and install on site very quickly. So that
the amount of work that's required on site is minimal. It should be just like LEGO, like
just -- it's kitted exactly and you go and you do like a crazy, eﬃcient rooﬁng
installation. So -- but economies of scale and making that installation process
eﬃcient are key to having the prices come down.
Okay, okay. So most millennials living in apartments rather than homes, what can we
do to make it easier to own and charge a Tesla without a garage? So we're
establishing supercharging locations, a lot more in city supercharging locations. And
they will be a little lower power. But in between a high-power Supercharger, which is
optimized for long-distance trips. But more power than would typically be found in a
home garage. So wherever their car is being parked, whether it's at the apartment or
work or somewhere in between, we're going to make sure that there's a place to
charge their car, even if you live in an apartment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-06
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 16 of 17OperatorOne of the key things for apartments is to manage the power. And so if you've got a
lot of cars parked in your garage and you have to design the system to handle a
hypothetical case, where all cars are drawing maximum power at the same time, then
you need a crazy amount of power. So it's important to have a system that load levels
the power so that they don't have to build a new substation just to supply the
apartment building. And so that's one of the things that's in the process of being
implemented. But no question, we need to solve this problem for apartments, not
just homes.
From Jimmy Hoﬀa, is there an electric plane in Tesla's future? Well we got a lot of ﬁsh
to fry. There are no plans right now to have an electric plane. We have a long way to
go to handle terrestrial transport.
And it's not inconceivable I would do an electric plane. But I do think that we're not
quite there in terms of the energy density of batteries for an electric plane. I think the
kind of minimum that you'd want is about 400 watt hours per kilogram. And even
that would require some pretty substantial innovation in the airframe and the way
that you build an airplane in order to have decent range with a like 400 watt hours
per kilogram. At 500, it starts to become quite compelling. But I don't know. I think
we're maybe 4 or ﬁve years away from having 500 watt hours per kilogram,
something like that, maybe half a decade, yes, in volume production.
Of course. No. I'm not saying we're going to add a nuclear fusion reactor. I'm just
saying it ﬁts.
So all right. Thanks, everyone, for coming. It's great to see you and I look forward to
seeing you next year. Thank you.
