Good morning, everyone. I'm Vivek Arya from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
semiconductor team. I'm absolutely delighted to welcome everyone to our
technology conference.
And especially delighted to have Colette Kress, CFO of NVIDIA, to kick oﬀ our
semiconductor part of the session. And she is also joined by Arnab Chanda and
Shawn Simmons from the investor relations team. What I thought we would do is I
can start oﬀ the discussion with some Q&A. But then open it up to your questions.
So with that welcome, Colette. Thank you for joining us.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thank you. So much.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
So maybe as a start, what I thought we could do is go through your diﬀerent
segments. And just this week, we have the Computex show, where you had already
announced your Pascal and GTx products before that. But I think there were some
other formal unveiling of products this week. There was some news from your
competitors, AMD, also out.
So if you could just take a step back and give us a sense for the PC gaming market,
what it has done the last four, ﬁve years, what Pascal means. And how does it shape
what the next few years might look like for that business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-01

Sure. Our representation in the gaming market is a very, very big part of NVIDIA. Our
gaming business represents more than 50% -- 60% of our overall revenue size. Last
couple of years, tremendous success from our existing architecture, Maxwell, in
terms of driving up the overall market for high-end gaming. And we had seen
growth rates probably more than 35% over the last couple of years in terms of a
CAGR.
We just ﬁnished our Q1 of ﬁscal year 2017 and more continuation of the growth. Our
business grew more than 17%. But as you mentioned, we also announced right at the
end of our Q1 our newest architecture for Pascal.
Pascal, we announced two new cards, two high-end cards, our 1080 and 1070, which
have begun selling and have received astounding reviews, both from the reviewers
as well as for gamers who are extremely enthusiastic. And a lot of that has to do with
the signiﬁcant improvement in terms of performance from even some of our highest-
end cards in our last generation as well as the price points being about the same as
some of the things that we had in our prior architecture. So we are very excited to
unveil those.
And our work in terms of Computex is continue to talk about those. And not just talk
about the underlying hardware. But the work that we've been doing around the
ecosystem. The ecosystem around gaming with overall design works, with VR works
in terms of our SDKs. And our software platform that helps make gaming continue to
even be better.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
So yesterday on eBay, I saw that some of those cards were selling for like $1,200,
$1,800, right? Two or three times -- I don't remember the last time semiconductor
products were selling for two or three times the list price.
But the question is do you have enough of the supply for what customers need right
now? Are there any supply hurdles or supply limitations?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
No. We are really excited about how people are very enthused in terms of our
founders' additions. We are coming out ﬁrst in the 1080s and 1070s. And as
expected, those were extremely, extremely popular.
We'll have supply quite shortly with the AIC card market and those will be here quite
shortly. But over the short period of time between the founders and the cards, we
are seeing a lot of other unique price points. But no, we'll have that all ready for the
AICs very shortly.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-01

Got it. Then lastly, we saw AMD also announced their competing architecture with
Polaris. And they have started the pricing of some cards as low as $199. So from what
you have seen in the competitive landscape, has anything surprised you at all? Is this
sort of what you had expected going in when you set the pricing of your products?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. There hasn't been any surprise in terms of what we have seen. We really started
our path with overall Pascal, trying to create a arena where there is a card for
essentially every part of the PC market. Enabling high-end gaming. But also making
sure that we are enabling VR at every stage of there.
So performance of our cards so far have been just extremely well received,
particularly at the price points. And we'll continue to see Pascal come out as being
some of the most power-eﬃcient cards out there and will probably enable
performance at almost every single level with our Pascal as it continues.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. On the upgrade opportunity, I think a lot of times, we try to simplify the
discussion of growth in terms of units and content. And what I remember from your
analyst day is you had said that the last ﬁve years you had 20% or so compounded
growth rate in PC gaming. So sort of in 9% from units, 11% from content.
As you look out the next three, four years, how do you see these two trends being
shaped individually? So on the unit side, I understand there's probably an upgrade
opportunity. Is that stronger now with Pascal?
And on then on the ASP side, are there things that you're doing in the card, right? Of
course, the pricing of your new product is better than what you had before. So if you
could just talk about the units and the ASP trends, I think that would be very helpful.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Referring to what we had discussed at our investor day back in the early part of
the spring, the results that we've seen there's been a lot of discussion of with 35%
growth, what are the largest drivers of our business? And the overall TAM
improvement or the TAM growth that we've seen over this period of time is
continuing to be a beneﬁt for us.
I believe we've been a big part of expanding those overall TAMs in terms of bringing
gamers to the market. Gamers come to the market based on both the games that
are available, the better the production value of those games. The better
accessibility to broadband around the world has brought them on board. But also
what we've seen is the expansion of eSports.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-01
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 17Vivek Arya
Colette KressThe expansion of eSports has literally put gaming in the same arena of any other
form of entertainment: a social platform that people are online together. So
expanding those overall users has been a big part of our overall growth as we've
seen units continue to increase in this market, aside from people looking at the
overall PCs that have not exactly grown.
But also, we've seen the increase in terms of ASPs. Not necessarily from us pricing at
diﬀerent levels. But gamers coming in and experiencing gaming at much higher
production in terms of the cards that they can buy. So we've seen a continued move
up of those buying higher and higher end cards for the games that become
available.
Our Pascal architecture is now again another opportunity for them to realize higher
end gaming, look at this opportunity to upgrade. When we think about our installed
base, there's probably more than 100 million gamers out there. We can see about 80
million of those, as those are ones that are with our GeForce experience,
downloading the things that they need for games in terms of the drivers and the
conﬁgurations.
Of those 80 million, there is still a very small percentage of them that are currently
on our current architecture, on Maxwell. So moving that to Pascal is deﬁnitely an
opportunity for an upgrade. Then we'll see what they think in terms of higher higher-
end cards. But we expect that to probably continue going forward as well.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Is it fair to think that if somebody who was buying, let's say, a $99 card before and
your content as part of a $99 card -- I don't know whether it's $20 or $25, something
in that range. If that gamer is now buying a $299 or a $399 card, that your content of
as part of the card is much greater percentagewise than it used to be before.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
The references regarding our add-in card market. So the add-in card, what we
consider to be the jewels inside of that add-in card representing the chip and the
memory are some of those key things that we supply, which is revenue to us.
Working with the add-in card market, they will supply all the rest of the diﬀerent
components that may be incorporated in those cards. We still have the majority of
the contents no matter what the price point is inside of those cards and that will
probably be a continuation.
As you've seen with some of the additions that are coming out with founders, there
is also unique components to really bring that at a higher level. High-end
components in addition to the regular AIC markets in terms of those founders'
additions. So again, the goal is really to provide that right card for the right type of
gamer. But you can expect us to earn about the same that we've had historically.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-01

Colette Kress{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
And what role will VR play in this? Are you already seeing some of the direct or
indirect beneﬁts of that? Or is that still to come, you think?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I think we are in the early phases of VR. But I do believe we think VR is that next
generation of high-end gaming absolutely that we'll see going forward. Our goal is
to enable VR across a wide spectrum of individuals. And individuals in terms of
mainstream VR players, high-end enthusiast types of gamers, as well as also VR as it
moves into professional.
We are nowhere at the stage where I'd say VR is already good enough by any means.
There's a signiﬁcant amount of work that will be done to improve that. Our focus has
been providing cards at all levels. But also working up the software components that
can engineer the VR experience to continue to be better. So I think we are in the
very, very early stages. But it's a bonus on top of what we see in terms of high-end
gaming on how we look at VR.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
So not to ask you to quantify everything to the nth detail. But if you look at all these
trends, whether it's the rise in the number of gamers, the increased attention from
eSports. And whether you look at all the content game opportunities and your
competitive position, is it fair to think this is still a midteens kind of growth
opportunity for NVIDIA for the next two, three years?
Or because I think there is a perception that we had a very strong cycle, we are now
sort of at the peak rate of that cycle. And now that consoles are getting to the later
part side of their growth, that it will also slow down PC gaming. Do you see anything
that slows down PC gaming over the next two or three years?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
PC gaming is a extremely healthy entertainment market here. It diﬀers quite a bit
from existing console types of businesses. Consoles has been a relatively long cycle,
not necessarily one that changes as you go. It's a buy a console and it stays for many,
many, many years. And it's not up at the level of the current production value games
right now that a lot of the high-end gamers are doing.
So we will see that continue to expand in terms of more and more people coming
online to game, which really feeds the types of games the game developers are
building for this overall market. So for what we can see, it's a continuation of what
we've seen, which is a great position.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-01

Colette KressOur Pascal architecture even allows more to come on board and experience the
great parts of PC gaming with all of their friends in the eSports type of thing. So I
don't see it changing. I think it's a very healthy position. And I think we're in a very
good space right now with the new Pascal architecture.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. And the last question then on gaming is one other trend that I remember from
your investor day was the discussion that emerging markets are still a big part where
there is the penetration is not obviously what it is in developed markets. So are you
doing anything special in emerging markets to expand penetration levels?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
It's a good question. People tend to look at just the US or some of the European
countries to understand key trends. But in the Asia PAC area, it has been very unique
to see the expansion of PC gaming.
But you are correct that there's many parts of the world where they just do not have
the broadband access that we have in terms of the Western world. So they've come
on at a much faster pace and they have really surrounded themselves against PCs --
or excuse me, with PCs versus in the US you have a division sometimes in other
types of form factors.
Our focus has been enabling all diﬀerent levels of the Asia PAC area. They may seed
in some of the initial things that have taken place in the Western world many years
ago. So we are in those same diﬀerent markets that you see in Asia PAC and we will
continue to fuel exactly what we've done already in our existing markets in those.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. And one last question on competition, because it comes up very frequently
with investors is that there is a perception that there is a new AMD now: that they are
doing things that are diﬀerent, that they have a better architecture, they have also
adopted the new 14 nanometer, 16 nanometer FinFET technology.
From what you see in the marketplace, is there any diﬀerence whether in terms of
pricing or them being any diﬀerent competitively? Because you have a very
dominant share of this market, right? And they are making the case that it's easier for
us to take share from NVIDIA right at this point right much better than what we had
at any other point. So have you seen anything diﬀerent in the competitive
landscape?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So if I had to say who was diﬀerent over the last several years, I think that's NVIDIA. I
think in the way that we've chosen to approach the strategic aspects of selling into
the gaming market and how we really transformed to a platform type of approach.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-01

Page 7 of 17Vivek Arya
Colette KressIt's not about a chip. It's not about a bigger and better chip. We have the resources,
we have the engineering horsepower to absolutely build some of the best
technology that's there. But we've surrounded that with a working across the entire
ecosystem, from the software developers to the overall gamers, giving the ability to
be involved in the community of other gamers and continuing to expand that.
So what you get with NVIDIA in terms of that sale is a platform, a community. And an
overall understanding of gaming as a whole. You don't get a chip. So I haven't seen
that in terms of the strategy anywhere else other than NVIDIA. So I'd say the changes
are primarily in NVIDIA than I would say that there is anywhere else.
The high-end gamers pretty much stay with NVIDIA just based on the commitment
that we have to continue to test the boundaries of both performance and eﬃciency
with our cards that we provide. And I think that's what we see.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. Then moving onto the data center business, that was one of the stars of your
recent earnings call. Could you maybe take a step back and help us understand how
do you segment that business? Whether it's hyperscale versus high-performance
computing versus enterprise. What are the key applications you address? So just sort
of a quick intro to that business.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Our data center business is a little bit diﬀerent than what you are seeing on the
gaming side. The gaming takes place really trying to enable the high-end graphics
that we need to do.
When we're talking about data center, we've used to using the GPU to accelerate
computing as a key component in the computing platform as we move forward.
We've been a part of the data center business for more than eight years. Eight years
in terms of high-performance computing and using a GPU to accelerate many of the
applications and high-performance computing and several of the large
supercomputers that we have across the world. So that is one part and one segment
of our data center business.
A second piece has also been the focus of the last two GTCs. We have discussed in
terms of the continued rise of deep learning and the deep learning framework for
artiﬁcial intelligence. This is a new era of using deep neuronets to actually help
artiﬁcial intelligence and a framework using deep learning to build more artiﬁcial
intelligence with many key applications, primarily right now with a lot of the
hyperscales and the breadth and depth that the hyperscales are using deep learning
in many of their diﬀerent types of applications.
Then number three, that is also our place where we have our cloud computing. So
our position where we have a GPU in the cloud that can be leveraged in a streamingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-01

Colette Kressenvironment or a partitioned things so we can have one to many using the overall
GPU.
All three of those businesses underneath data center are growing quite nicely. We
continue to have both the scale, the understanding of the use of a GPU. Its
performance, its programmability, its power eﬃciency makes it probably the only
form factor that people are using for deep learning and deep learning training.
We're going to continue to focus on expanding to enterprises, other industries. Real
industries where data is essential. And understanding more and more about that
data that they can serve up to the end customer is the key focus. And that's been the
driver of our underlying data center business. And we expect that to continue.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Now, the revenues that you reported for that business I think surprised everyone.
Was there any impact from one or two large customers? Or do you think this is a new
baseline and this business can actually be sustainable and even grow from these
levels?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. If you've actually watched our discussions over the last couple of years and the
rollout of deep learning. And it was really started in a lot of the research institution
and higher ed, as they really focused on this new framework. And so you see every
single hyperscale across the globe focused on deep learning.
And so it's really a situation of the breadth and the depth of the projects together
which is overall driving our growth. And you know, there will be continue to be
project rollouts across those hyperscales and also movement into enterprises as well
that will take that.
How big this market is, how fast will grow? What is that size? That's not something,
because I think we are in some of the early stages right now of deep learning for us
to really understand the scope and how fast it could overall move.
But we are excited with the progress and really being there with the right platform.
And not just the right hardware. But the right development platform which has
enabled a lot of this deep learning as well.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
How is your visibility just conceptually in this kind of a business? I understand there
are a lot of trial, a lot of things going on. But do you already have a somewhat good
sense of what the next one, two, three quarters might look like for this business?

Vivek Arya
Colette KressIt's a diﬀerent business than selling gaming cards, right? Gaming cards is a one-by-
one type of sale here, one by one to each type of gamer. In the case of our data
center business, we will deﬁnitely start out understanding the problems that they are
trying to solve, understanding their architecture that they have in the data center.
And then how we can assist into there.
So we have long relationships and relationships still yet to go and build across this
industry. But most of it has really been about a long relationship cycle and seeing
them continue to roll out across many diﬀerent workloads or many diﬀerent projects.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
So it's good visibility?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I'd say we have a good list of people that we are working with, yes.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Okay. Who provide good visibility?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We have a good list of people that we are working with.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
I thought I would try. Google recently announced their TensorFlow product, which
they said can replace CPUs and GPUs. There were a lot of headlines around that.
First, is that sort of claim true, that can somebody like Google going design a
product which eliminates the need for stand-alone GPUs to do this kind of thing?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
It's good to get a good understanding of the technology surrounding deep learning
and the diﬀerent parts of deep learning. So deep learning training is really taking the
data and working with throwing it at deep neural networks in a very powerful
performance that's necessary, requiring what we see today is the only form factor
would be GPUs actually in those training environments.
What we see is there's also use of seeing that from an inference standpoint as well.
So taking exactly those algorithms that have been developed in the deep learning
framework and using it for any new data that is also entering into the overall
network. That inference has been primarily used with CPUs and other easier forms of
conﬁguration of maybe ASICs or FPGAs in those manners. But we're also starting to
see GPUs being leveraged in that piece.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-01
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 17Vivek Arya
Colette Kress
Vivek AryaSo the overall ability to use a TPU for deep learning training is probably not what
their overall intention was. It was mainly for the overall inference market. We're
continuing to work on building with our Pascal architecture that we came out not
only training. But also GPUs for inference as well.
So it doesn't surprise me that someone would have self-built. But our focus is going
to be on the complete deep learning process, both from the training side through to
the inference.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
So do you see them sort of as a one-oﬀ or do you see this as a widespread industry
phenomenon? Because I think what we are seeing in a very diﬀerent market in
smartphones, for example, when Apple was able to design their own processor,
right? They were able to design a very good processor and that did hurt the market
for merchant silicon in smartphone processors.
Now, I understand this is a very diﬀerent market. But if Google can do this, what's to
prevent Facebook or Baidu or somebody else from doing it?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
The overall deep learning or even the acceleration market has been using many
diﬀerent form factors for quite a while. So this isn't anything new. The use of custom-
built ASIC could easily be done.
The question is the performance and how well they can master the overall
performance through there. And that's something that we've been able to continue
to excel at just based on our overall resources and development that we see.
So it is unlikely that there is that much custom ASIC design that can be done.
Because it's actually very challenging and the amount of investment that's necessary
to build that. So we've seen this; we've continued to outperform with coming with
new performance, new power eﬃciency going forward and I think that's what you
can expect.
So I think it's a very, very diﬀerent market than a single use of what you may have in
terms of mobile. There's many ways to solve this. But lots of investment that is
necessary that would really preclude a lot of people from really starting this part of
that business.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
So I know it is harder to pinpoint exact growth rates because these are new markets
that are starting to develop. But if, let's say, somebody were to say that over the next
three or four years, CapEx by the cloud guys would grow, let's say, 10% or 15% a yearFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-01

Colette Kressthan this market opportunity, is it fair to think it could grow at or above that kind of
rate?
And I'm not asking for a forecast. I'm just trying to say that how should investors
think about quantifying this opportunity? Should it grow faster than the growth of
CapEx by all these cloud players?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, I think each of the cloud players are very, very focused on their data center
throughput and focused on improving the workloads that they have serving
consumers. So this could be, if we looked at their CapEx, a very, very important part
of their future CapEx investment.
We're one component of that piece. But if you really break down the overall
computing architecture, we can be a material part of improving that throughput as I
think about that architecture going forward.
We tend to look at where those markets are, where the data is. What types of
workloads would be best suited for deep learning as a focus of where we are. So we
look at it as following the data. You've seen a lot of research of Big Data ﬁrms also
looking for deep learning in those possibilities. So I don't think it's a bad way to look
at. But you'd have to break down their CapEx in terms of where they are looking to
invest in within there.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Let me pause there and see if there are any questions from the audience on gaming.
We will talk about automotive and some of the other businesses. Okay, I'll keep on
going then.
On automotive, which has been another very strong area of growth for NVIDIA, how
much of what you're doing is infotainment? And how much of it is like putting the
seeds in place for autonomous driving, advanced driver assist systems. And so forth?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I think that's a question to say of our time and dedication and research. So when we
think about our infotainment business, we've been in our infotainment business for
more than 8 to 10 years working with automotive, premium car manufacturers, on the
high-end infotainment systems that you see. We have more than 10 million cars on
the road with our infotainment systems in there and there's more cars that will overall
hit the road.
Our strategic focus has been to build upon those relationships, as we saw a very key
need of taking exactly what we understood from the data center to solve a very
diﬃcult challenge with automotive companies. They are looking for a way to doFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-01

Colette Kressautonomous driving or self-driving. But that's a signiﬁcant amount of computational
power that's going to be necessary to understand everything that surrounds a car
and serve out the set of instructions. Many form factors have been through ADASes
continuing to advanced ADAS through handwritten man years' worth of algorithms
written in order to address that market.
Our focus has been using deep learning, using a center computing platform that is
both open and scalable to build toward autonomous driving. So our -- most of our
focus right now absolutely is on autonomous driving and building that with the many
car manufacturers and Tier 1s that we are working with. Probably 80 diﬀerent
examples of Tier 1 startups and research that is happening in terms of autonomous
driving.
But the majority of our revenue today of course is still from the infotainment world
that we have right now. We are starting in terms of development contracts and will
likely in the next 12 months or so have our platform, our DRIVE PX platform, for
autonomous driving in production in a set of cars.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
When I look at the competitive landscape -- so automotive and automotive
semiconductors is on top of mind. That's been one of the few growth areas which
people thought would grow and is actually growing.
And what I see, though, in competitive landscape is you have, there's like NXP, who
bring a very diverse set of products to that: safety and microcontrollers and whatnot,
right? So very broad set of products. Then you have the typical smart -- the
traditional smartphone companies, like Qualcomm, Intel, who are approaching that
market from a more smartphone mindset that let me not just worry about the
processor. Let me also think about touchscreen controllers and power management,
putting an LTE baseband in there.
How -- when you look at this automotive opportunity, where do you see NVIDIA
being in that spectrum? Or is it just that there is enough growth as a stand-alone
high-performance computing part of the car that should drive growth for you for the
next few years?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
It's hard to look historically at this space and say here is where we'll be. Because we
are really talking about a space that has not been developed in terms of yet. The cars
in terms of their digitalization is a key important part as we move forward. Right now,
if you look at an average car, more than 50 diﬀerent microprocessors within the car.
So all of the competition has a place to overall play and they may be single function
types of thing.
Our focus is to say that overall compute power, that central repository is absolutely
necessary. And it's going to take some time for that to build and scale for the highestFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-01

Vivek Aryalevel of autonomous driving over the next future. But that transformation is in front of
us and it is necessary.
Focusing on just a single microprocessor or a single function is not the evolution that
we see and are going to be focused. It's more about creating the connectivity of a
central platform inside of there that can connect with all of the diﬀerent cameras,
sensors, radar, lidar that may come into the car going forward of algorithms and how
to deal with that using a deep learning framework.
And we have everything from training that data outside of the car, taking the
information, the data that we receive from cars to better create the information that
you are going to need moving forward. The other players, again, all diﬀerent form
factors of things that may be incremental from where we are today. But we are
looking more at about what's going to be necessary for a full autonomous driving
car in the future.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. Then maybe in the few minutes we have left to talk about ﬁnancials. So we
have seen very strong expansion in gross margins over the last few years. So how
much of that is that your business is moving away from the legacy more competitive
PC market to more of these high-end products?
And if that mix shift has been the key trend, is gross margin expansion sustainable?
Can we continue to see -- is there more room for growth from there on gross
margins?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
If you think about our focus on the output of being gross margin and what is the
underlying driver there, mix is a key component. Whether or not you are higher
priced I think it is more it is a platform sale to where the value that we are delivering
often is in the development platform layer. The development tools, the development
libraries. And the software that comes with so much of our overall products. And we
have those platforms for each one of the specialized markets that we go after.
So continuing to work that has allowed us to achieve higher gross margins. The mix
of our products continue to move closer to those higher-value products. And that
mix has driven higher margins.
It's still going to be our focus as we go forward to see our enterprise, our data center
businesses, have higher gross margins than the Company average. And our gaming
being more than 50% has a big inﬂuence deﬁnitely in terms of our gross margins. It's
still going to be our concentration, we just don't know what that perfect mix will be
and how fast those gross margins may grow.

Colette KressAll right. Now, I understand next year, there will be a reset because of the rolloﬀ on
the royalties. I think that's known and been understood. But let's say two or three
years from now, would it shock you to see NVIDIA get to 60% gross margins?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So what we are referring here is our Intel licensing agreement is -- we are in the ﬁnal
stages of the existing agreement. We don't have any knowledge in terms of which
way that will go. It's ﬁne to assume that it may be zero and there would be an impact
if it did not renew to our overall gross margins.
So aside from that, as our focus in some of these key areas where large TAMs are,
whether that be data center, whether that be gaming, there's absolutely an
opportunity for gross margins to go higher. Will that be 60%? I'm not sure I have a
good exact number that I would sit here and commit to on that.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
But is there anything in the business to prevent NVIDIA to getting to 60%?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
There's always factors that can come in.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Conservatism.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. There is not everything in our portfolio that is above the Company average. And
then we could be at a higher amount. But there are some things that we still have to
work out in terms of getting there. But that is our focus.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Right. Because I know automotive, for example, is typically industry-wide is a lower
gross margin business. Is there something you can do there to expand the gross
margin?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
It's the exact same process. It's not about selling the chip inside. It's about selling a
lot of the development platform and the development services that we've been
working on for DriveWorks in terms of autonomous driving. The value of that is a
huge opportunity for us in both our revenue as well as in terms of our gross margin
expansion.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-01

A - Colette KressQuestions And Answers
Could you comment on the Intel agreement? And what is the breadth and depth of
that agreement in terms of their access to your IP and patents? Does it extend to all
IP and patents through 2017 and how -- and do they carry those rights beyond 2017?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
There's a cross-license in both directions in terms of license to theirs and they have
license to our portfolio through what we refer to as the capture period. The capture
period ends in the First Quarter of our next ﬁscal year. And they will still have access
to those even after the capture period. But they won't have access to anything new
past that capture period.
Is it a point of leverage as you develop and ﬁle new -- is the capture period ﬁnding
anything ﬁled as a patent during the period or anything developed from there?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
In terms of that ﬁne clarity, there is some line in terms of the details. But I think it's
easy to just say after Q1, anything new that's put into a true patent would not be
captured.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
In terms of the cost structure, that's also been I think one very important aspect:
you've had very strong control over the cost. And last year, there were some
litigation expenses because of the litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. Some
of those have been settled now.
So is there an opportunity to take those and invest in some of these growth
opportunities? Or do you think those sort of help to -- they can actually fall through
to the bottom line from here?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So our prior year did have a signiﬁcant investment as we worked through the
litigation with Samsung and Qualcomm. Our peak of that, though, was probably in
the ﬁrst half of last year as we were getting ready for the ITC cases at that time. So
we've been continuing to wind down a lot of some of that high expenses.
So what we've seen is relatively consistent, ﬂat overall expense base for quite some
time. And what that really has been about is making the appropriate investments that
we see necessary: one bringing Pascal to life as it is today. But also in terms of some
of the go-to-market paths that we've been for data center and some of our new
businesses as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-01

Q - Vivek AryaBut we continue to look at the eﬃciencies or things that are rolling oﬀ in order to
manage the overall operating margin of the Company as a growth that we'd like to
see. And that's really going to be our focus as we continue to go forward: operating
margin expansion, making the right investments. But it being assured that we can
continue to expand margins going forward.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. So if I look at some of the best-in-class fabless companies, they are able to
achieve 30% operating margins. Is that a bad target to think of when we think of
NVIDIA?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I think focusing us as a platform company and having us focus on operating
proﬁtability is the right thing to think about. We're talking about some pretty big
markets in front of us that our experience with our overall leveraged infrastructure
has deﬁnitely enabled us to really attack these markets. We need to make sure that
we make those investments and also so that we can really achieve the TAMs that are
in front of us.
So it's a balance on how fast that can be. I think we are pleased right now that from a
non-GAAP perspective right now, we are sitting at about 25%. And over the last year,
that's grown more than 470 basis points. So it's moved quite well and we are very
pleased with the output of our production, our engineering. And those investments
that we've made. But we'll continue to focus on that and continue to focus on
proﬁtability.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Last two very quick sort of rapidﬁre-type questions. Are some of your gaming
products also being used as data center accelerators? Is there a classiﬁcation thing
or is that a small thing or we are ﬁxating too much?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
It's a really small thing. Any type of researcher who is wanting to dabble in GPUs can
easily go online and get one delivered. And that may be one of our high-end
gaming cards. It may be one of our TITANs. They may start with a workstation or they
may buy one of our Tesla-branded ones.
That's a good way to get started, because remember: each one of our GPUs is
programmable and comes with a programmable set for them to get started. It's not
something that you see in the data center in a mission-critical architectural design in
terms of there. But sure, a researcher here or there that's gaming as well as
researching deep learning using the GPU (multiple speakers).
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
But you don't see some big cloud guy going to a Best Buy and buying a lot of (end
products) from there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-01

Okay. Then the last one is the PC OEM business. That's obviously come down to a
very low level. Does it sort of just ﬂatten out from there or it continues to go down?
It's a very insigniﬁcant part of the business now, right?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
It's not a material part. It used to be a material part. We are looking at numbers less
than 10% of our overall size of our revenue. We are in the business as a people need
an overall discrete GPU and a general-purpose PC. We are not in the business to
from an economic standpoint to lose money on there and that we'll go back for a
design win to design win back and forth.
The overall PC market may not be a growth market in the near future either. And if
that's the case, it will probably be at the level it is or follow in connection with the
overall PC market. And we'll play in it if it's economic sense. And it will probably
highly correlate with the overall PC market.
