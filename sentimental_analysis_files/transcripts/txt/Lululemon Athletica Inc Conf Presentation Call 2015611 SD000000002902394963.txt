Okay. So we will go ahead and get started. I'm Sharon Zackﬁa.
Very happy to have with us today from lululemon Stuart Haselden, CFO. Founded in
1998 lululemon has expanded its store base at a compound annual growth rate of
19% over the past ﬁve years to more than 300 stores in the US, Canada, Australia and
New Zealand, the UK and Singapore. We expect store growth will stay at a mid; to
high teens pace through 2018 with plateauing unit growth in the US oﬀset by an
acceleration in growth in Europe and Asia with management targeting 20 locations
in both Europe and Asia by 2017 versus what I think is three today.
Before turning the podium over to Stuart I need to tell you there's a complete list of
research disclosures and potential conﬂicts of interest at williamblair.com. And that is
the last time I'm saying this at the conference and I'm very happy.

Okay. Great. Thanks Sharon. It's great to be here.
I've got a relatively short presentation. And maybe we'll save sometime at the end
for some Q&A.
You probably know the story pretty well already but I'll restate some of the key tenets
of the business strategy and the business model. This page I think just it hits on the
headlines of really how we compete and how the business model, the fundamentals
of the business model are focused. It's certainly a major renovation focus in terms of
the product in particular and continuing to move forward with the product from a
technical design standpoint and a functionality in solving problems for athletes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-11

Page 2 of 7The guest and our ongoing obsession with the guest is certainly central to how we
think about the business model. Quality and design, we believe our products are
unparalleled in terms of the design and the quality and the ﬁt and the make and the
raw materials that go into it.
And the vertical business model, we control all points of distribution so there is not
ever any conﬂict with any other participant in how our products are presented to our
guests. So these are really the key elements of the strategy.
This slide presents the elements of what we call the brand operating model that
we've talked about on the earnings call. We've got some quotes here from Laurent
around each of these three pillars. The product certainly what we've talked about
with reigniting the product engine, getting past some of the issues back going back
to 2013.
And the focus is incredible in terms of just ensuring that the product from just a
usability and the end-use and the rationale and the reasons we make each of the
products to what goes into them and the vendors in the factories and the mills that
we use. Then more recently the investments that we've been making over the last 12
months or so on a supply chain itself to enable us to get those products to market to
our stores to fulﬁll our website demand in a way that is more streamlined and
eﬃcient.
Guest experience, certainly a big focus as I just mentioned. The educators we view as
the most important employees in the Company and really where we engage with our
guests. And that's really been from what I've. And I'm still pretty new to the
Company. So but what I've come to recognize in the short time I've been with the
Company the educators and just that in-store culture is really where it all began and
where the heartbeat of the Company continues to beat the loudest.
And that understanding of the guest stems from our investments in our educators
and the caliber of people that we have running our stores and working our stores I'm
never -- it never ceases to amaze me. I spent some time yesterday afternoon with our
Chicago team and just the quality of the folks that are on the ﬂoor, I believe in the 15
years in retail that I've had is really I haven't seen a stronger team. So that's certainly
a big part of the model and has been from the beginning.
Brand and community, it's an interesting model and a very unconventional. The way
in which we build showrooms, seed demand, identify who are the folks that matter in
terms of getting the product connections in those communities and then how that is
sustained once the stores are opened is a really unique model and again part of I
think the secret sauce of lululemon. And you're not going to see the big ﬂashy
expensive media campaigns because this element of the business model is more
true and more authentic to the brand and how it's a established.
So just a few slides on drilling down on each of those elements of the business
model. So the product I talked about how this comes to life speciﬁcally in theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-11
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 3 of 7investments that we're making now, upstream at our headquarters and with our
design teams we've invested heavily in what we call the white space program which
is a physical location at our headquarters in Vancouver where we test products, put
them through diﬀerent technical, almost experiments with a group of scientists really
that are engineering the diﬀerent feels, the diﬀerent ﬁts and the diﬀerent
functionality. So that's certainly a central part to how we think about those products.
You can't standstill. We have to move forward and continue to innovate. So investing
in that capability in that white space is pretty critical.
Also we are now building what we call regional design labs. And we have the ﬁrst
one now in Vancouver, in the process now of opening the second one in New York
pretty soon.
And so those will be how we will connect with so that we're not just in our
headquarters talking to ourselves, we're in the communities. And there will probably
be a handful of these over the course of the next couple of years where we'll be able
to have a very close connection with our ambassadors.
So can you guys hear me? So those regional design labs will be a way we can again
not just talk to ourselves in Vancouver but be connected with our ambassadors and
our guests in key markets to continue to collect information to inform that product
innovation process.
I love this slide. It's the slide on guest experience and there's no people in the
picture. But it's a beautiful store.
This is actually this is our Robson Street store. You may have heard us mention this I
think on the Q4 call, we relocated and expanded the store in that we increased the
size of the store by 50% and the sales went up 60%.
We doubled the size of the men's portion of the store and the men's volume
doubled. And so there was no dilution in the productivity of the box after we
increased it 50%. So we did three of these type stores last year Robson Street, Santa
Monica and Lincoln Road in Miami all had similar results.
So we're doing 10 more of these this year, 3 in Canada and 7 in the US and we're
interested to see how these stores perform. The men's business we believe and I'm
going oﬀ of the guest theme here per minute, the men's business we believe is one
of the more exciting parts of the growth story.
And certainly when we built a lot of the stores you go back 10 years the men's
business then was not what it is today or what it will be. And so just thinking about
what's the right real estate strategy to support that part of the business model is
pretty interesting and exciting.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-11

Page 4 of 7But again coming back to guest experience you get a feel for with this picture just
how the stores are designed. We do put a lot of thought and eﬀort into the ﬂow, how
we create what the educators call the kitchen party. They want a small store with a lot
of energy that creates these spontaneous interactions that you might not get with a
bigger store.
This is a shot of the holiday party in Vancouver outside of the headquarters. It's not
that. You guys thought I was serious.
This is a pretty cool photograph of Orchard Road in Singapore. In front of the
opening of the ﬁrst store there we did a yoga event. And I don't know how many
thousands of people came out to that but it was I don't know if you guys have been
to Singapore but Orchard Road is the main retail thoroughfare.
There is literally mall after mall on either side of the street, super high-end and to
shut it down it would be like shutting down Fifth Avenue in New York. And this just
kind of gives you a feel for the level of interest in the brand overseas.
I went down to Australia with Laurent a couple of months ago. And we took a look at
a market there which is really strong and growing and improving from a productivity
standpoint as we have bought back the business down there.
But I stopped in Singapore on the way back and I spent a day with our regional
manager there. And it was so exciting to see the store that we have in ION that is not
in a fantastic location but is just killing it.
And the second store that we opened recently in Takashimaya, another great center.
It's just the, it's palpable, the interest in the brand. And in talking to Delaney
Schweitzer before she left she described it as she would get the goosebumps in
Asia, in Singapore, in Shanghai similar to when the brand was just starting in North
America, just the excitement and the energy.
So I haven't been to Europe yet. I'm sure it's a similar dynamic but I can tell you Asia
is pretty exciting.
Then just growth drivers. So we've talked about these on the call. I mentioned a few
of them earlier.
But as you think about what are -- how will we grow the business, what are the levers
of growth, there is a number of them and these certainly overlap in many ways. So
the geographies, we still have a fair amount of runway in North America that we're
deep into the work there. And certainly with international I just mentioned Asia,
we've got store openings in Germany planned for this year.
We're just getting into the early stages of that and it's pretty exciting. The London
stores are doing fantastic. Every store we've opened so far has exceeded ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-11

Page 5 of 7expectations our performance.
And so it's really just how do we grow the brand overseas in a way that preserves the
model, the integrity that presents the brand in a way that will both lead to long-term
success and ultimately the highest margins. So the thing about you look at the
history of North American retailers who have gone overseas and it's a pretty
checkered past in terms of who's done it well.
What I love about the Lulu model and the approach to international expansion is the
showroom. I really feel like that is such a unique element of the business model that
derisks our investments and increases our odds of success. It helps us understand
those markets, build awareness for the brand in a very community-based grassroots
manner and it helps us get a read on those markets.
And if we don't hit a certain run rate in those showrooms we won't open the store.
So where we have made mistakes it is where we've shortcutted that process. And so
we're looking -- we will have operated showrooms for 12 to 18 months in every
market where we'll be opening stores.
Demographics, this is a bad word for our men's business, our women's business and
our kids business. Tremendous growth particularly in men's as we begin to really
build out that assortment and bring to market interesting new products that we just
haven't had in the women's business, continuing to reinvent that business. I think
we've talked about the pant wall that will get introduced in Q3, really exciting.
We had the design team in our March Board meeting present to the Board the
product line there. And it was really exciting to get a preview and I think our
customers will be really excited and it will be the next generation of the fabrics and
the ﬁts and just taking that product to the next level.
I mentioned the men's business and our kids business also, it is a nice extension of
the business model if you will. Probably not the overall growth potential as we would
see in men's but nonetheless a nice avenue of growth for us. It's also a way for us to
begin to catch or engage with the future lululemon shoppers early and build that
customer pipeline or connect with those guest earlier.
Category extension. So we'll continue to think about where the brand ﬁts from a
category standpoint certainly beginning with yoga, run has been a great extension
for us there, getting into the run focus to products. Tennis has been something that's
got a fair amount of traction.
We recently introduced some of our cycling products in the men's side that have
gotten great response, great reaction. And again it's really about solving problems
for athletes and that will drive that thinking around which categories make sense for
us to compete in.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-11

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantThen channels, stores, omnichannel, meaningful investments for us in driving that
omnichannel and e-commerce strategy. I think we mentioned we have a pretty major
website redesign underway for this year that will introduce enhancements to our
website from a look and feel and how it shops to functional characteristics in our
checkout process which should improve our conversion.
And in the stores as we've talked about that's really how we continue to extend and
rollout the business in North America where we have runway and international. Then
continuing to think about the real estate strategy and some of the comments made
earlier around just the Robson Street model and what we've learned from that and
where it makes sense where we could have opportunities for expanded formats.
We've got a men's only store in Soho that's doing well and trying to think about and
maybe look at other places where we could test that model also to see do we like is
it better to have that men's format separated or is it better to have it combined
under one larger store with our women's business. So yes, that's really those are the
key drivers I would point to.
Then just a couple of slides on the ﬁnancial results. You guys saw all of this earlier in
the week for our Q1 results. We're encouraged to see the comp outcome fueled
largely by our acceleration in our e-commerce business.
You see here the e-comm penetration reaching almost 20%. Don't see anything
structural that would prevent us from driving that number even higher. So yes.
Then the guidance. So I'm not going to belabor what I would expect you guys have
already seen in terms of the outlook for the Second Quarter in the full-year. We feel
like we're on track.
We're seeing good momentum from a traﬃc and conversion standpoint. I think we
had mentioned on the call that we've seen in the ﬁrst ﬁve weeks of the quarter a
good positive comp trend to include our Canadian stores. So we're seeing healthy
demand that we're now that we're getting past the worst of the port issues and
getting product into our stores now we're seeing the customer respond which is
been really exciting.
So it's good. I feel like we're on track, good momentum. And that's it.
