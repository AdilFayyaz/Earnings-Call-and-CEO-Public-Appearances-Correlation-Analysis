{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Well, thank you for joining us today.
My name is Phil Winslow. I’m a Software analyst at Credit Suisse. Very excited to have
what has been one of my favorite companies for a very long time -- Microsoft --
joining us today.
So David, thank you for -- well, you’re already down here in Arizona. But -- so I was
going to say thank you for coming down. Thanks for coming over.
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Thanks for making the drive, yes, out here.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Exactly. So not a bad place to be.
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Not a bad place to be.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Relative to Seattle right now. I know the IR team is happy. But let’s focus in, I’m going
to be -- you’re going to be shocked where we’re going to be in, again, Microsoft
Cloud.
So maybe just start at a high level for us. Kind of talk us through sort of the vision that
the company has for Microsoft Cloud. Obviously, that’s a very expansive vision but --
and the products that, how they create value for customers in your mind.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30

That’s great. So thanks, Phil. Thanks for having us down here. Happy to be here and
tell a little bit of the story.
I think it’s a pretty well-told story at this point. But still there’s always something new
going on.
I remember back in the early days when we were talking about Microsoft Cloud and
how big it could get. And each year, we are wrong. And each year, we’re wrong
because we guessed under, and so we just kind of quit guessing at this point and
just said cloud’s ubiquitous.
Satya has an interesting perspective, which he says, anything that shows up as OpEx
is potential to him, which I think is true because if companies are spending money in
any way on OpEx, that’s something that can be brought to a computer and brought
to the cloud.
We started out, as everybody did, with primarily starting out as infrastructure, and
then data became pretty quickly relevant. And then after that, it’s SaaS. And now it’s
some of the ML and AI. And so I just think it keeps growing, and I think the power of
it keeps getting exponentially better because when you start out with infrastructure,
that’s all well and good, but it’s a pretty simple process. But when you’re actually
running a SaaS app and you can reason over the data and use ML to help run your
business better, then I think it’s all that much more powerful. And so that’s sort of
where we’re at.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. And then let’s focus on Azure because actually, this is my 10th anniversary of
being an Azure bull. So I wrote about that in our 2011 outlook report saying, hey, it
begins now. And then 13, when Azure Infrastructure Services came out, and we sort
of doubled down on that. And obviously, we’ve seen years and years and years of
steady share gain. And if you think about the past ﬁve quarters, four of the past ﬁve,
Azure is outgrowing Google cloud. Five of the ﬁve it has outgrown AWS. So how do
you think -- what are you seeing from customers as leading to this incremental share
gain by Microsoft?
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Well, I think they see the value prop. They certainly -- there’s a few things we have
going as a company. I think one is that we’re the most global cloud, and there’s a lot
of companies that want that assurance that if they’re going to move into a new geo
that there’s a cloud there to support them. So I think the global nature of it helps us a
ton and has helped us land some big deals even in countries like China, where it’sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 14A - Phil Winslow
A - Dave O’Harahard to break in, but we have the cloud infrastructure there to support it. So that’s a
big beneﬁt for us.
I think we also have some of the best security in the world in some of our security
software, which has been a big push for a lot of companies in the last decade but
even more recently in the last ﬁve years, and I think we’re pretty well positioned to
go do that.
Teams is super popular and the pandemic, of course, helped drive adoption of that.
But we just happen to be in a good position at the right time. But even though
Teams, that was years’ worth of investment to get where it got, and so you sort of
have to start early on some of these things.
And then we recently announced some of our industry clouds. And the industry
clouds are generating lots of buzz, lots of interest. Customers, of course, want
something that’s closer to what they do, and that’s what it’s intended to be. And so
the industry clouds are getting a lot of traction. And so I think we just keep adding
on to it. Again, I would just emphasize AI and ML, which once you have all that data
and you have that functionality and you can reason over it and ﬁgure out a better
way to run your business, that’s what people are ultimately looking for. So we just
keep moving closer and closer to what the speciﬁc customers need.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Let’s double-click on industry clouds a little bit because I think that’s been also, to
your point, sort of one of the diﬀerentiators of Microsoft and Microsoft Cloud, the
focus by industry. But I wonder if you can share just a little bit more about what the
focus areas are within industry cloud and how is this opening opportunities for
growth.
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Sure. So the industry clouds that we announced are healthcare, retail, manufacturing,
nonproﬁt, sustainability and ﬁnancial services. And so those are the industries that
everybody is after, but they all have very unique needs. And again, as you look at the
migration up through infrastructure to data to SaaS to industry cloud, it’s just natural
that we get closer to what the customers are looking for.
And just let me use sustainability as an example. We have lots of interest in our
sustainability cloud just to pick one out. When we announced it, when we
announced that it was going into preview, Judson and I did calls with customers in
Europe, and then we did another call with customers in North America. And what -- I
was surprised by the attendance. Lots. Lots of people called into it; and two is they
had very speciﬁc questions. This isn’t some sort of ethereal idea. This is like, hey, we
need to make this real. How are you going to make it real? How does your industry
cloud help us make it real? And so there’s a ton of interest in those industry clouds.
I also think it’s just the beginning. When we launched those industry clouds, it’s not
like we check the box and called it done. We’re going to continue to build those out,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 14A - Phil Winslow
A - Dave O’Hara
A - Phil Winslowand we’re going to continue to make them more speciﬁc to customers. And the
more speciﬁc they get, the more value-add they have.
And just from a ﬁnancial perspective, there’s obviously very well-known competitors
in the infrastructure business. And a lot of times, the margins on that might get
driven down just by competition. But when you can diﬀerentiate with the industry
clouds, I think it just puts us in a better position as a company and in a better
position to help customers. But the sustainability cloud, I was shocked at how much
interest there is in that. I mean we knew there would be some interest, but there is
more than we expected.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Interesting, interesting. Now commercial bookings continue to grow double digits
this last quarter. And Amy noted that it was really driven by consistent execution
across add-on, new and renewal sales motion. So when it comes to new deals, what
is the tipping point in your mind of like sort of why Microsoft wins?
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Well, I think one is the hybrid story, and we started early with the hybrid story
because companies had invested a lot in what Microsoft had to oﬀer and they had a
lot of on-prem investments. And they just said, hey, we don’t want to throw all that
out. We paid for it. It’s working. It’s functional. What are we going to do about this?
And so we came up with our hybrid strategy of, hey, if you’re an Azure customer,
we’ll give you some licensing beneﬁt to you for being an on-prem customer. And
then you can move when it’s good for you to move. So the initial pitch for the cloud,
as everybody remembers is, hey, lift and shift. Throw all that stuﬀ out, move to the
cloud. And we just said, look, we can do it in a more moderated way, in a more
thoughtful way. And that started to really take oﬀ.
And two is I do think we’re seen as a trusted partner and a trusted provider. And I
mentioned the security software, I think we continue to build out security software.
We have insights into the global Internet that a lot of companies don’t just because
of our reach and our breadth. And I think that allows us to provide some good,
secure software.
And then we -- as I mentioned, we continue to come out with ubiquitously beneﬁcial
products like Teams that all companies can beneﬁt from. And then we -- once we do
that, we can add value to that with Teams phone and other functionality that we can
add to really drive the adoption of the cloud. And so I think all of that puts us in a
good position. And when we talk to customers, they just want to know they’re going
to be safe, secure, that it’s reliable, that it’s global and that it has the functionality that
they need. And I think that’s where we’re at.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Got it. And then once again, another kind of high-level question here, but when you
think about existing customers, where is the growth coming from? Is this newFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30

A - Dave O’Haraproducts, increasing consumption, new seats moving to premium SKUs to your point
or just call it new product, new services?
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Little of all of the above. So we’re constantly adding new services to Azure. And so as
people consume those new services, they -- that drives consumption. The nice thing
about the consumption model, which, again, everybody realizes now, I don’t know if
we were as smart as we thought we were at the time, but the nice thing about
consumption is it’s not capped. I mean if you’re out selling a licensed product,
there’s a certain ﬁxed amount of market share. But with consumption, I really think it’s
what Satya said, which is literally, if you’re spending OpEx, that’s an opportunity for
us and that’s potential TAM. And so I think that’s driving a lot of the consumption, just
the new services that we had.
Certainly, from a -- even from a modern work perspective, if you look at the new stuﬀ
that we’re adding there, we have our E5 SKU, which when we started out, that was
really about a certain set of services, and now those are getting more adoption. And
so if you look at Microsoft all up, I think the important part to us is the Microsoft
Cloud. It’s not about the Azure cloud, it’s not about modern work cloud, it’s about
the Microsoft Cloud, including dynamics, including many other things. And so we’re -
- I think that’s where the expansion is coming from with the existing customers and
with new customers. They see the beneﬁt of having one company that’s running all
of that for them. So...
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
I call it sort of the Azure to Oﬃce to Power, to Power to Oﬃce to Azure pipeline back
and forth, and that’s why I’m sort of sticking with Microsoft Cloud in the questions
ﬁrst because it is the three working together.
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Now let’s drill down a little bit more into Azure. I want to hit on consumption base
because I think that is a key point, which is obviously thriving, as you mentioned.
How do you structure these agreements and the go-to-market strategy to help
facilitate more consumption growth?
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Sure. I think -- and it’s always -- everything is an evolution. This has been an evolution
as well. I think that there’s so much cost upfront in terms of how people thought
about building out data centers and infrastructure that we basically said we need
good, long-term contracts because we need to be able to build out a viable
business, and we’re willing to commit to you. We need you to be willing to commit to
us. And we still work with customers on long-term contracts, but we’ve also built in a
lot more ﬂexibility.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 14A - Phil Winslow
A - Dave O’Hara
A - Phil WinslowIf somebody says I don’t know how much I’m going to consume, then we can go do
a PayGo deal with them, and they can consume what they consume. And we have
even things like meters in there to make sure they don’t go over a certain amount.
And -- but we give them maximum ﬂexibility in terms of how they pay for it. And then
we work with them on making sure that, again, even with modern work as another
example, like do you have the right number of users? Do you have too many users?
Do you have too few users? How should we think about that? And so we just build
maximum ﬂexibility in the contract so that customers can pay for what they use.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Got it. Awesome. And then obviously, as you mentioned, sort of the breadth and the
depth of the Azure portfolio continues to expand. And how do you think about sort
of the rate and pace of innovation here with inside of Azure? But also how does this
aﬀect the gross margins of Azure, but initially to your point, as you move sort of up
the stack infrastructure?
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Yes. It’s always interesting when you report out ﬁnancial results because it’s sort of
very numeric as if there is a grand plan. And there’s sort of a grand plan, but I think
it’s a lot of things coming together. One is you just have to keep driving revenue
growth. And fortunately, that hasn’t been an issue for anybody in the cloud business.
There’s lots of revenue growth opportunity.
Secondly, we just always have a sort of a very focused approach to how we’re going
to drive down cost and how we’re going to make this more eﬃcient. And then we
pass that through to customers, and it’s part of being price competitive, but it’s also
part of just making the cloud more eﬃcient.
And then when we think about all that, there is timing that comes into it, when do
things get built out, how do they get built out, where do they get built out. Folks
have asked how do we feel about -- as an example, how do we feel about our data
center expansion. We’re covering 90% of the globe and like 95% of the GDP, and so
we feel good about where we’re at, but we still need to add capacity in those geos.
But I do think that we’ve seen a more moderated CapEx spend maybe on a relative
basis than we historically did. And so when you have good revenue growth and
driving down costs and you have moderating CapEx spend, you tend to have margin
expansion. That’s kind of where we’re at. But it’s -- all of those things have to come
together. It’s not any one thing or it’s not sort of like you just plan it out and it
happens. You just have to be sort of maniacally focused on each of those things and
getting better at each of them.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
So okay, expanding products that it’s like increased consumption, frankly, the secular
shift -- accelerated secular shift for the cloud. One of the questions I get is that,
frankly, can Microsoft keep up the sales hiring to essentially -- on the go-to-market
side to support all this innovation and these trends?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30

Page 7 of 14A - Dave O’Hara

A - Dave O’Hara{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Yes. I’d say knock on wood, but there’s no wood up here. I would say right now we
have a good talent pool coming to us and saying, hey, we’d love to work for
Microsoft. So I think culturally, we’re perceived as a pretty good place to work. I think
that from a positioning perspective, people feel like we’re well positioned. I think
salespeople feel like they can come in and they have something they can go sell to
companies and that it’s got value and value-add, and we continue to add value.
And so we -- I mean it’s a super competitive market. Everybody is hiring from
everybody else, and there’s a lot of horse trading going on with employees. But I
think overall, on a relative basis, we’re in a pretty good position. And so far, we’ve
been able to keep up in the same way that we have -- that’s a question on sales, I
think it’s a question on engineering, I think it’s a question on support. Hopefully, it’s a
question on ﬁnance people, although we’re usually just happy to have a job. So
we’re -- but still, I think there’s -- it’s competition for high-tech labor right now, and
we think we’re doing okay. Again, knock on wood.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Got it. All right. We touched on Azure. Now let’s go to Oﬃce, Oﬃce commercial
going up and down that pipeline that I discussed. Obviously, Oﬃce 365 installed
base keeps growing. ARPU keeps increasing even with some, call it, dynamics and
maybe in the installed base of where the growth is coming from. So help us walk
through those. I guess, break them into 2, sort of growth of the installed base, where
are you seeing the growth come from. And then ARPU, how do you think about sort
of ARPU growth from here?
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Yes. I would say that people -- there’s sort of -- there might be a historical perception
of Oﬃce just literally as Oﬃce: Word, Excel, PowerPoint. And we’ve expanded far
beyond that. And I think as we continue to add value and we continue to add SKUs,
that helps with ARPU growth. It used to be that we had our E1 SKU, and we talked
about E3. And people were always asking, like, when are you going to be over 50%
of your penetration with D3. Now they ask that same question about E5.
When we architected E5, we really said, hey, let’s go identify places of value for
customers where they might be underserved or where we might be in a better
position to provide it outside of classic Oﬃce. And so we came out and said, we
really think it’s about communications, we think it’s about security, and we think it’s
about analytics. And so that’s what we did. That’s how Teams came to be because we
started out with a product called Link, and then we bought Skype. And then out of
that evolution came Teams. And so I think we’re in a pretty good position for
communications. And some of the Team’s usage numbers we’ve published lately
again, very pandemic-driven, but we just happen to be in a good business and take
advantage of that. So the comm stuﬀ is landing. Security is always a big issue. I think
people are getting smarter about how they think about analytics.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30

A - Phil Winslow
A - Dave O’HaraAnd so when we think about Oﬃce, migrating folks from E1 to E3 to E5 is a natural
progression. And I think a lot of them are beneﬁting from that and seeing that. And
so we’re getting better penetration of E5. I would also just say from a usage
perspective, we’ve come out with a lot of functionality that’s directly beneﬁcial to
small businesses into frontline workers until we’re adding users there. So at the same
time that you’re migrating from E1 to E3 to E5 and driving ARPU up, we’re adding
users in the frontline worker, which is a lower-priced SKU. And so again, it’s like
several moving things that end up resulting in the number. But the key for us is to
make sure that we’re continuing to add value at those higher-end SKUs and provide
value for the lower-end SKUs. And in between there, you end up with good ARPU
growth and good usage growth.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. I think you bring up a great point because like you said, ﬁnance folks, we like to
look at the numbers and be like, oh, here’s the gap between revenue growth and
seat growth and there’s ARPU. But with inside that seat growth, inside the ARPU,
there are two of these very diﬀerent dynamics. And so I guess it makes the ARPU
increase even more impressive in the sense that, hey, a lot of the unit growth is
coming from the...
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Frontline workers.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Frontline workers.
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Yes. And it’s just -- and it’s not you can’t focus on one number, you have to focus on
all the individual drivers. And I think that’s what we’ve gotten better at, is focusing on
individual drivers, and then what comes out of that is the number.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. And so you talked about E5. Amy talked about it in July, 8% penetration in the
O365 commercial installed base. How are you thinking about just E5 adoption from
here? And then within that, how are you thinking about the enterprise voice? You
mentioned Teams phone sort of in that strategy.
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Sure. So we tried to make it so that it was easy as possible for customers to make use
of that. So we -- E5 is what I said, the bundle of communications, security and
analytics, but then we also came out with many SKUs. There are a lot of people to
just say, look, I don’t want the whole thing. I’ll just take this piece. And then what
we’ve seen over time is that customers go, okay, I’ll start with one. Start with security.
Hey, I’ll add comms. Hey, this analytics stuﬀ is kind of not bad. And so maybe I’ll go
do that. And then they go, you know what, we’ll just buy E5. And so we do think it’s
allowing people to consume what they really need at the time. But over time, in theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 14A - Phil Winslow
A - Dave O’Hara
A - Phil Winslowspirit of the Microsoft Cloud, I think they see the beneﬁt of all that. And at some
point, we just make it attractive for them to go the whole way on that piece of it. And
so I think it’s early days in the adoption of E5. Obviously, 8% isn’t where we’re going
to ﬁnish. But we’re not going to force people to go there, and we’re not going to
have some big push to get there fast. We’re just going to let them migrate there as it
makes sense for them.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. To your point, everybody is asking about when’s penetration of E3. When there’s
E5. So next question next time we’re up here, I’m going to ask about E7. When is that
coming? But let’s focus on Teams because the other thing you announced in July,
the earnings, almost 250 million monthly active Teams users. Obviously, to your
point, huge hockey stick over the past two years here. October call, you said, usage
has never been higher. So not just simply monthly active users, but actually usage of
those monthly active users higher than ever. How do you think about the
monetization strategy of Teams? This is a question I get a lot because, obviously, it’s
included in O365. But what is sort of the strategies or monetization addressable
market there?
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Well, one is I think people expect us to continue to deliver new value for modern
work in -- so some of the stuﬀ just gets built in because it’s the new value that people
are looking for and they’re already paying us and so we include it, and that was our
thinking on Teams is we said, hey, we want people to use it. We want people to
consume it. We want people to beneﬁt from it. So let’s not sort of constrain it by
charging more because they’re already paying us a decent amount of money
anyhow.
And -- but still, even with that, if you had referenced in your previous question, I just
forgot to answer about the Teams phone stuﬀ. We have 80 million teams phone
users, and I think that’s an example of where people -- or we can monetize and
people can get additional beneﬁt. Because in some cases, they can just go
throughout their PBX, which is a pretty expensive system and just switch to Teams.
And there’s huge value add for them. And so I think that there’s -- in addition to just
the core teams platform, there are ways that we can monetize beyond that. And even
some of our industry clouds are tapping into Teams now, and that’s the way that
they’re going to operate. And so it’s not direct -- it doesn’t have to be directly
monetizable by Teams itself. I think it can be monetizable through things that work
with teams. And so I think the key for us is to continue to gain share, which we feel
good about the share we’re gaining and then build around that and add value. And I
think there’s plenty of ways to monetize even if it’s not directly.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. Just sort of just the engagement of living in Teams, so to speak. I mean just at
Credit Suisse, one of the things that -- a path we’re going down, we signed these like
10-year contracts with these PBX guys, these telephony folks. But it’s like, actually, we
want to terminate in Teams. So even though we’re not using a hosted PBX becauseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30

A - Dave O’Harawe signed long-term contracts, but it’s like actually, no, we still want it to terminate in
Teams. So that actually becomes the hub. And so...
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
And at some point, the option might be there for everybody to go do that, but I think
that’s a good example. I also think that not just us, but for ISVs that want to build on
Teams as a platform. There’s an opportunity for them to monetize as well. And so
we’re seeing lots of ISV interest. It’s sort of -- I mean everybody knows how ISVs
operate, which is they add value to speciﬁc pieces of software. But mostly, they just
look for like a big user base. And so once you get over a certain number of users
that are like, hey, we want to build around that, and so we’re seeing lots of ISVs show
interest in Teams.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Teams as a platform. And so the -- and I’m very much looking forward to my Teams
avatar, pretty conﬁdent with that, coming up. I’m going to trick that out.
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
It’s there.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. I’d say yes. We’re a little slow. We’re a bank to roll out the new features.
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
We have a couple of senior execs who show up for every meeting in an avatar.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. It’s like get ready for a marketing call near you. Avatar Phil coming at you. The
power platform. So that’s been, what I call, almost like the hidden successes, sort of
secret successes inside of Microsoft. You’ve obviously seen strong growth there, as I
mentioned. And recently, you talked about 20 million monthly active users. What is
sort of -- what is the value? Actually, maybe to step back for some people that don’t
know, like what is the power platform? What is involved in it? Why are you seeing a
strong growth?
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Well, I think we’re seeing strong growth. Power platform allows people to basically
write low code, no code and essentially help more of the world become developers.
And so if you look at Powerhouse power platform, the real value it adds is the ease
of use, but also just the ﬂexibility and the ability to create apps quickly.
We’ve had customers that would come to us. Again, as you think about the evolution
of the cloud, it used to be lift and shift and then optimize. And now we’re getting to
the point to where we’ve had customers that have 10,000, 12,000 apps, and they’re
trying to ﬁgure out, geez, how can I cost-eﬀectively migrate all these apps to theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30

A - Phil Winslowcloud? And then they look at them and they go, you know what, maybe we don’t
need all these apps or maybe we should rewrite some of these apps. And so they
might cut down on the number of apps, they might go and add new apps, but they
do all that through Power Apps and Power platform. And so it really allows a lot more
people to become developers and a lot more people to build apps that ﬁt their
exact usage. And so all of that is done in the background by us, and so I think that’s
the -- a driver of the adoption.
I get involved with lots of customer conversations and deals. And invariably, we’ll talk
about the Microsoft Cloud and dynamics and Azure and modern work. And then at
the end, they circle around and go, hey, we really want Power Apps, like we really
want Power Apps for as many people as we can get. And so it’s interesting how that
just almost becomes an anchor in some of these deals. Like they see that as the
hidden treasurer.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Interesting. The -- what’s next then for the power platform? Because it’s amazing how
much it has evolved organically and inorganically. What are the product innovations
that you’re most excited about?
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Well, I think the ease of use is going to be great, but I also think that the ultimate
thing is to put the power in the hands of the user and put power in the hands of the
customer and let them evolve it where it needs to go. And so we’ll just continue to
make the product better, more powerful and more easy to use. And I think users will
dictate where that goes.
But I think I would just say, again, it’s -- once you get the infrastructure, once you get
the data, once you get the SaaS app, you understand the usage patterns. And when
you can reason over that with machine learning and AI, that’s where the real power in
that comes from. And I think once people start doing that and doing it with their own
apps that are tailored to what they’re trying to do, I think that unleashes a lot of
power. And so we’ll continue to see strong demand there.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Got it. In the last ﬁve minutes here, I’ll pause for a moment to see if there are any
questions from the audience. Just raise your hand, and I’ll call on you. Otherwise, I’ll
just keep going down my list. Okay. We’re killing it.
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
We’ve answered them all. We’ve answered them all.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
We’re killing the Q&A, but I actually want to double-click on AI/ML because I think
that’s one of the, obviously, I’d say, artiﬁcial intelligence could be the most impactful,
call it, technology innovation before -- any others before it. The -- but where -- walkFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30

And then where do you think we are in the adoption cycle actually productizing?
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Yes. I think it’s super early in terms of how we productize AI and ML. And in some
level, I remember having this conversation with the boss years ago, he was like, how
do we monetize this stuﬀ? And I said, hey, we’ll ﬁgure it out as we go. But we -- part
of it is just making it again available in the Microsoft Cloud and making it ubiquitous.
But AI has advanced so far. I mean I remember when we ﬁrst started out and said,
hey, let’s ﬁgure this out. One of the things that we would look at is people to do a
credit check on a customer, they had to call a treasury and say, can you do a credit
check. And so somebody wrote a simple bot. We use that bot now. A salesperson
goes in, enters a customer name. Boom, it’s all taken care of. No human interaction,
all of that. Saves thousands of hours, which eventually that all adds up. Now I think
we’re getting much more sophisticated about it in connecting data sources and
connecting the reasoning. And then even with our own -- some of our own internal
stuﬀ, where you have the machine learning where every quarter, it gets better and
better and better, I think that’s ultimately where it’s going to go. But I think it’s super
early days in terms of how we tap into that.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. Wxactly. Now the -- yes. I mean just -- I mean probably eating your own dog
food, too, with the forecasting, so with the AI/ML side.
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
We do, we do, we do. We still -- there’s still humans involved because I think there’s
still judgments to be made. But once you get that pattern recognition and you can
reason over it, I think that’s ultimately where it’s going to be.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. I’ve joked. I was like, I swear it’s the tightening of the ranges in the guidance. I
was like that’s a machine. It’s --
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
It’s partly the machine.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
And the people. And the people, of course.
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
I would say for the ﬁnance team because I think it’s natural for people to say some
computer is going to knock me out of my job. And with our ﬁnance teams, we just
said, hey, we’re going to do that. You’re still going to be involved, but we’re also
going to free up time for you to go work with customers and show them how itFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30

person to get on the phone with the customer. But we had -- pre-Covid, everything is
either pre or post, but pre-Covid, I think the year before, we had something like
1,500 ﬁnance folks who worked directly with customers on solutions. And so when
you can do that, when you can automate a lot of the stuﬀ, you free up folks to go
work on other meaningful and impactful things. And I think that’s the ultimate beneﬁt
from it.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Just don’t put too much equity research capabilities in power automate. That’s the
one caveat, I guess I would say. Pull back on any eﬀorts there. The -- sorry, last
question for me unless there is anything from the audience, but when you think
about sort of the dues from a management team perspective over the next, call it,
this ﬁscal year, what are you just top of mind for you?
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Well, I think we need to -- it’s a super competitive environment.
So we need to make sure that we’re working directly with customers and getting
direct feedback and adapting. We’ve learned to be nimble. I don’t know that I would
have described us as nimble ﬁve or 10 years ago, but we’ve learned to be nimble.
That’s one.
Two, as you mentioned, recruitment. I mean it’s a fast-growing business, and we’re
growing a huge business top line by -- on the commercial side by more than 20%.
And you have to have folks who are going to help do that. And so I think recruitment
and retention of employees and making sure that people want to get up and come
to work every day are big deals. And then we obviously have some big numbers out
there. But we’ll continue to execute on that.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. Those big numbers keep getting bigger so -- which we like to see. So awesome.
Well, the 30 minutes went super-fast. We really appreciate your time. So thank you
for coming down -- or coming over, like I said.
{BIO 20323127 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks for having us.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Okay. Well, thanks. Appreciate it.
