Hello, and welcome to the Fourth Annual Wells Fargo TMT Summit. My name is Phil
Winslow. I'm the software analyst here at Wells Fargo and very excited to have one of
my favorite company. The company is joining us Microsoft and longtime a Tom
Fannon [ph] and obviously, been a big fan of Azure. I was just looking at some notes.
I think is my 10th anniversary of being an Azure bowl, and so very excited to
welcome Julia White, Corporate Vice President of Azure marketing. Julia, thanks for
joining us.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
I'm so glad to be here. Thanks for having me.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
(Question And Answer)
Cool. Well just to kick things oﬀ. I wondered if you could just -- thanks for everyone
on the webcast. Tell us a little bit about your background roles and responsibilities at
Microsoft?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Absolutely. So I've been at Microsoft almost 20 years now, long time and the past six
years, I've been leading the Azure and server product marketing. So kind of all
things are Azure cloud services as well as things like Windows Server, SQL Server,
Visual Studio, Developer tool chain as well.

Page 2 of 13A - Julia WhiteFair. All the fun stuﬀ, all the stuﬀ I love it's that we can have a great conversation. So I
guess 2020, what you guys have been so far. I think back in April on your ﬁscal Q3
earnings call Satya noted that you'd seen two years of digital transformation the ﬁrst
two months of the pandemic, we're now 10 months now into the pandemic and we
believe CIOs are re-evaluating their strategies whereby no cloud has substantially
become a no-go going forward at least that's a one-liner that we've been using. So
my two questions you are -- can you talk about the COVID-19 impact on Azure? How
its evolved over the past 10 months and what are your customers and partners telling
you?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. I know it has been a wild ride at least. I mean, ﬁrst stepping back and seeing and
working with customers who had already moved, as cloud has already done a lot of
work around digital capabilities. It is super clear that they've been able to be more
agile, adjust, adapt to what's happened. So it has been this idea of digital
transformation and how important digital capabilities are. I think what I've learned
most is that it really does matter. This has been a bit of a test, pressure test frankly of
whether that's proven to be true and it's -- and deﬁnitely seen in terms of agility
ability to switch and meet customer's demands changing, deﬁnitely diﬀerent.
In terms of the overall trends we're seeing, one, lot more urgency to the cloud.
Everyone had a cloud plan, as you -- like, it wasn't the no cloud, but it's now the
urgency and then much bigger, right? They were dabbling or having a very long
plan now, they're like bigger and faster. So that's certainly true. And a lot of it what
why the agility to go to scale up and down, a lot of customers are like, I wish, I could
scale down quickly and movements. So recognizing that. In a lot of cost
management, the cost optimized not run servers a little capacity over long run. So
lots of that type of opportunity.
But then also just need a lot more better capabilities, things like, real time analytics,
rapid app developments. They just needed the cloud and needed the cloud for
those. So lots of those shifts and we can talk more about the speciﬁcs there. But I
think the other thing is, the people always ask me like why isn't cloud adoption
happen faster sooner? I'm like, it's just culture, like people, norms and that's me is
maybe the most dramatic thing that's changed with COVID, right? Around the IT
norms or the culture or whatever reason they didn't want to move faster kind of
blown away. And so that's -- I think that's going to be one of the most durable shifts
we've seen, continue to increase and be durable through this time.
And of course, when I say that people like (inaudible) is Azure revenue going to spite
them and after watching this all that glad consumption does take time. Each of these
projects as they start, whether it's a migration, new approximately, they start small
but they grow over time. But to me, it's an incredible strength as long-term growth
when we see the increase of those projects and the size of those projects increasing
as they go. So -- and then I think the last bit is as we've looked at the diﬀerent
industries and how they're impacted, the high impacted industry is certainly cloud
adoption fell, right? They cost optimized down, they did other things, but the impact
the industries that were not as impacted absolutely spiked so it kind of bounced oﬀFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 13Q - Philip Winslow
A - Julia Whiteand we're now actually seeing even the high impacted industries come back to more
normal rates and so it's starting to see that level oﬀ.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Exactly. I mean when you're just talking to quote from Mike Tyson, it went through
my mind, "Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face" and that's sort of
I feel like cloud migration and digital transformation. There was a plan, but oh my
gosh, whatever my plan was I need to accelerate it. And I guess at least my next
question is sort of prioritization in digital transformation. Can you talk about what
you're seeing from a project creation, projects prioritization perspective from your
customers, has evolved. How do you expect us to evolve in future and over the past
10 months. What is the price you the most about Azure?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. I'll pull that apart. So I'd say a couple things that change dramatically right away
in terms of prioritization. So virtual desktop, right, our services around windows
virtual desktop absolutely spiked and everyone went home and needed to be
working remotely, along with teams, obviously Microsoft teams adoption and our
virtual desktop and our team's integration works together, so you saw that both grow
and there was -- those were projects underway, but they become the quickly the
number one projects. Similarly security, and like always hackers never waste a good
crisis and so around COVID, we saw a lot of new diﬀerent kinds of attacks, diﬀerent
kinds of techniques being used and so we saw a bunch of Azure security, kind of a
broader enterprise mobility security capabilities being put into place quickly.
Particularly with remote work, not everyone had done all the network security, all the
endpoint security they needed to have that in place. So that certainly became a top
priority from a project perspective.
And then the third one that was within the mix, but suddenly became more urgent
was around rapid business process changes, right? We have line of business
systems, you have ways you're doing work you suddenly need to do involve those
really quickly. And Microsoft had this technology called Microsoft Power Apps, take a
low-code way to build applications. And that became the favorite tool of choice to
whether it was hospitals trying to track PPE really quickly or retailers moving to
curbside pickup and remote checking in (inaudible) check out, that type of
experiencing Starbucks doing mobile pick up in their app, being able to do that in
the low-code way really quickly. So you had maybe the nurses in the hospital ﬁguring
out the process versus needing professional developers.
So with that, we did it's a big push around integrating Azure and our capabilities
whether it'd be data services or (inaudible) services with GitHub and Power Apps. So
now we have this beautiful kind of professional developer to low code experience
based on the urgency there. So that was certainly a big one.
And then I think to your question what hasn't changed, but maybe is continuing as
strong pace is analytics and again those -- the modernization of analytics was very
much underway and is underway, a lot of people still sitting on old legacy systems
that aren't keeping up and COVID just put pressure on that, right? People like usedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

Page 4 of 13Q - Philip Winslow

Q - Philip Winslow
A - Julia Whiteto be ﬁne. Then I got 60 day and 90 day old data, like no way I need like 12 hour
data and all my past forecasting models need to evolve and so that use of analytics
and getting to modern analytics has continued to be quite strong, and I expect that
one actually to be even, continue to accelerate as we move forward to certainly hot
area there.
And then the steady run right business of migrations of existing systems, hybrid used
cases, I think those are steady states certainly we saw a lot of people quickly move to
back up possessed recovering in the cloud, but the kind of run rate of migrations
and cost optimization, super strong.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
After describe those two, the gateway drives to the cloud and disaster again just
(inaudible) recovery business continuity where, I need for risk mitigation perspective
to potentially use this capacity. It was maybe cheaper than I've been done -- been
doing before it was better. So maybe I'll then talk about production workloads.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes, it is nice to the cultural norm. That's a very culturally easy way to kind of start the
journey, right, and very common.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Exactly, I'm sure Microsoft from a market perspective has used gateway drug [ph],
but as an analyst good (inaudible) switching gears just a little bit here, (inaudible) still
obviously for some Azure. I think investors are always very much solely focused on
sort of the headline Azure growth number, but I always say there's so much more to
love here, but from your perspective, what are some of the most exciting emerging
or critical, but underappreciated parts of the Azure portfolio?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes, it's such a vast portfolio. So I love this question. So before I jump into that, I
would say though it is ﬁrst, well everyone loves the Azure numbers, important to
appreciate, right, that our overall commercial cloud business is over $15 billion this
last quarter and grew over 30% and so the thing I want to start with is Azure is a core
part of our world Microsoft cloud. All right, and that's across the Microsoft 365,
Dynamics 365, platform GitHub and then of course, all the underpinning about
being Azure. And I think you're seeing us and I mentioned the integration of GitHub
and Power Apps and Azure coming together to create these experiences. You're
seeing more -- still more and more of that to provide those integrated solutions for
our customers.
So I think that's a certainly something that's exciting and emerging and maybe still
under appreciated. So all three of those things, but really keeping an eye towards
the Microsoft cloud growth all up and then Microsoft cloud experience all up. So that
is the ﬁrst thing I might speak to you. Then within Azure more speciﬁcally, you get
exciting emerging and underappreciated? I'll break those down. I'd say let's start
with the critical, but underappreciated Azure SQL. It's a big business that's a placeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 13where customers really look to us. And the thing that's so strong there is we've taken,
our third year old database engine that we perfected and secured in it's the same
on-prem, the same in Azure, it's even same as edge.
And so you have this amazing capability and eﬃciency. So you have the same skill,
same systems being used anywhere as you build these distributed applications and
distributed system. So that's certainly a key -- a key opportunity around Azure. And
then as I mentioned the Windows Virtual desktop VDI again, not (inaudible) but a
huge percentage of people's existing data center footprint is on VI, and these
opportunities to modernize the move to a more capable platform, run it more cost
eﬀectively certainly a big piece of it. So kind of the some underappreciated areas
maybe.
I think from the exciting category analytics, this is -- it's been -- it's a long time
coming at some level like of all the places that haven't modernized, but there's this
moment of moving to a true cloud native analytic system, and seeing that we have
things like Azure announce [ph] and Azure Power BI that can bring together the
opportunity and the actual business, in fact, how much -- like Microsoft CFO cares
about this. How much our business leaders care about this, because what it unlocks
from an organizational decision-making actually making it much better informed
decisions, database cultures all of that is there.
Another area and building on that would be AI, right? I mean so much opportunity in
this and we're seeing it's been again long journey on AI what we're doing, but really
seeing some phenomenal breakthroughs. And I was just looking at the latest on our
image recognition technology where it kind of, I used to go to and say "oh, look it's
two people talking on the webcast." Now we literally say, this age, this gender, this is
just amazing and thinking about so many diﬀerent use cases whether it for help
working people who are visually impaired or just navigating the world. So really
starting to see that and with that the responsible AI aspect of it, right? The
transparency in the models and data protection around the models reducing bias
and that category of things, I think is very exciting on that one.
And then from the emerging category the things to keep your eye on the future, I
would say mixed reality that's a place where we've been long in mixed reality and it
just like we've seen AI of all from being this kind of s... thing, just being something
that's just part of every single application. We expect mixed reality to have the same
thing, right? There's going to be an element of mixed reality, there's a need for
mixed reality in almost any application you have and as it gets easier, cloud services
make that more native and then the devices like the HoloLens and others expand, it
will become more accessible to everybody.
So that's -- and I think it's again been underway for a long time. But you can start to
see how that's going to really take oﬀ. And then more on the industrial side of things
that is digital twins. And again the idea of -- in the kind of the next generation shift
from IoT, right, where you have connected things and this is essentially taking it to
connected environments. So now you have whole systems and understanding how
the system of connected things works together. How do you optimize it? How doFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

Page 6 of 13Q - Philip Winslow

Q - Philip Winslow
A - Julia Whiteyou run it with greater inside? How do you understand the overall environment that's
connected on that part.
And then last but not least, certainly, further out, but massively profound is quantum,
right? And we're now what 14 years into our quantum computing investment
amazingly enough and it'll be 14 more years to, but building up the software
language, the development of SDKs, the simulation engine and getting all that ready
for the quantum compute capability as well.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
In fact, I saw (inaudible) who Head of Technology kick oﬀ today. That's one of the
things he's been talking about frankly since he got here and every time I interviewed,
he sort of increasingly excited about, hey, quantum is not here yet, but it's getting
closer and sort of the pillars, the foundational layers are being put in place and we
actually received a white paper as a bank about some of the things that quantum
could means. So, yes, it deﬁnitely thought about that. Okay, maybe not. I will put that
in Azure numbers yet, but I'm excited about it nonetheless.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Maybe it's interesting, even on that one, we have a quantum simulation engine. So
it's running quantum algorithms just on classical computer CPU, GPU and we're
actually seeing like remarkable breakthroughs and working with hospitals on MRI
recognition, like massive improvements even though it's just simulating, it's
interesting. So yes, a lot of potential there. Not yet in the numbers.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes, exactly, fascinating algorithm (inaudible) put that in the category, stay tuned. It
was the -- obviously, we just walked through a broad portfolio there and I guess a
follow-up question that is thinking about where to invest, what does Microsoft's
framework for growth and operating investments in meeting long-term especially in
the context of Azure's revenue. Where do you think we should see increasing
investments what areas can we may see some deep harvesting potentially?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Okay. Maybe -- again (inaudible) back for a second. We look at the overall Azure
total addressable market is about $4.5 trillion. So like massive just scratching the
surface. So I always remind ourself that there's still a ton of growth in the core
business, right, around compute for systems, like hybrid cloud solutions, running big
SAP ERP systems in the cloud, high performance computing network security. So lots
of growth, and potential, and investment frankly in the core part of the business
which is still a healthy, healthy part of it.
From an increased perspective, as I referenced before, analytics lot of investment
there, machine learning, those two are both evolving really maturing into broad TAM
into themselves. And so expect those to be get big work forces overall as I move
forward. And then a few of the new areas like we've moved into our operators and
helping telecom communications and operators, and we acquired Metaswitch and aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

Page 7 of 13Q - Philip Winslow

A - Julia Whiteﬁrm networks, in that space as well. So big investments there and really helping that
segments, run and optimize into a digital world.
But just like all the other industries moving to digital transformation now in the
operator space. And then working with them right whether it's 4G, 5G and beyond
helping them modernize all of that. And then also from kind of increased investment
area just overall cloud native app development, as a lot of organizations have been
tweaking and modernizing and migrating applications, but now it really, like more
and more, like we need to just move to a full cloud native application, capabilities
like containers and kubernetes, adding AI services into these applications and really
meaningful ways and like, if your application isn't leveraging AI in the next ﬁve years,
it's going to be relevant. So going deeper into the code not just drifting it over and
optimizing it, so that certainly on the radar from an investment perspective.
And then it was actually from IoT and edge perspectives. Actually four years ago, we
announced our kind of $5 billion investments that was going to be spanned ﬁve
years. So we're coming up on the tail the last few years of that. But that's the place
where we belong on as well, (inaudible) three years ago coin like intelligent cloud,
intelligent edge in that pattern. So investment, I think well ahead of market, but
continuing to be on that very important secular change on that. And then there's not
a lot to do prioritize and Azure and it's a good problem is a high-class problem, it's --
there's so many, it's more about which growth opportunities are you going to wait
on versus which ones are you going to go big on versus de-prioritizing per se.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
And obviously I just mentioned edge, I mean I really wrote about that when
(inaudible) came over to Wells Fargo, January, three and a half years ago. And I was
like, hey, I think there's this next platform shift coming. I don't know what it's called
exactly. We were calling it fog or micro fog it's --
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
I remember that.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
And then all the sudden, I was like, I'm not sure what this is, but it's -- I think it's going
to be big and then sitting in build and all of a sudden is intelligent cloud, intelligent
edge, I'm like, yes, it's like ﬁrst oﬀ is better branding than micro fog the -- and -- but I
was like, maybe we're not crazy, Satya's even up on stage, Bill talking about it. So I'm
excited that actually to pointing on the network side. I thought there was also going
to be sort of a natural extension of edge is that the role of the 5G and the operators
in an edge called to cloud world where they are kind of the glue.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Absolutely. Yes, all those pieces have to come together and there are -- they are,
right, and not all here yet. But you start to see that at pattern and as we know the
cloud and edges that's really in our simple terms and application pattern and theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

Q - Philip Winslownetworking capability is what makes that feasible and interesting in a more
compelling way.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, I actually already sometimes that networking is actually the drivers
sometimes of the platform shifts in computing. If you think about it, client-server was
actually enable probably by Ethernet. It's a connectivity lays oﬀ from the driver of the
platform.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
With the bottom of that, one or the other, but yes.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Exactly. So they work together. And so I didn't want to double click on something
you mentioned earlier, hybrid cloud, mold like mine because that's oﬀspin [ph] I
would say that was my original board case 10 years ago on Microsoft was the -- just
that amazing relationship. You have a customer's on premise, but also then
extending that into the cloud with Azure portability of called code, tools, processes,
people into the cloud. But as customers increasingly embraced the cloud, how
should we think about the growth of your on-premise oﬀerings and now hybrid and
multi-cloud comes into play?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. And as you've stated, we've always held it on premise cloud, edge will be
durable, right? And that there will be technology on premises and that's incredibly
important, whether that's big servers, whether that's small devices, right? And before
we continue to invest in our servers create modern experiences, like an example
Azure Stack HCI, Window server based capability that is perfect for modernizing on-
prem systems bringing down your on-prem footprint, but like with cloud capabilities
for disaster recovery and backup those type of things. So bridging those two worlds.
And actually it made a great stat is over 1/3 of our windows server and SQL server
enterprise customers are using our hybrid beneﬁts to deploy to Azure, right? And
that's a fantastic beneﬁt gives more value for your software assurance agreement on
with your on-premises servers, but also gives you beneﬁt into the cloud, right? And
that's the one with that capability AWS is actually ﬁve times more expensive than
Azure for running windows server and SQL server. So it's a huge customer beneﬁt as
well. So is the technology part of it, but it's also the business model part that
supports it as well to ensure that customer value holistically.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. One of the words I think it's been probably the biggest change may be the most
impactful change over the best called 12 -- 24 months, has been the word multi, not
just simply hybrid cloud, but multi-cloud the future. A couple questions here, what
are you seeing in the ﬁeld as the top reasons why customers' strategies are shiftingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 13A - Julia White
Q - Philip Winslowto multi-cloud? And where you think the implications for Azure are and in particular
how do you sort of defend your mode in world of multi-cloud?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. Multi-cloud is the new term. I don't think it's a new reality, right? It's just a new
term, but it's not a marketing person like this new terms and what -- and what -- how
do customers get there? Why do they get there? It is the common things. I see or its
acquisitions, right? I had one cloud strategy acquired or diﬀerent cloud strategies
come together super, super common. There is some level of like, I don't want to be
all in one vendor. I'm going to distribute my cloud capabilities and put a lot of it. I
would say is -- was very much bottoms-up, wasn't because there was a strategic
decision to be multi-cloud. It just kind of happened. My developer chose this. My
data science teams likes that, these are tend to be project by project decisions. And
so you might run your SAP system on one cloud and do data science projects on
another cloud. And again based on the individual group, they decided to do that.
And mostly when I talked to the CIO, CTOs, it kind of happened and they discovered
themselves their versus it being super intentional.
But I look at that's exactly what on-premises look like. Their data centers are 40 years,
there was like, hey, there were never a homogeneous. Lots of diﬀerent systems, lots
of diﬀerent tools, despite people's best intentions it is a heterogeneous world and
there always be best of breed, best of those kind of dynamics. I don't think the
clouds going to be a lot diﬀerent, right? And I think that -- and I think we've had that
view and frankly if hybrid recognizes that view of that everything won't just sit in one
big cloud on that one.
So what we try to do is take our history of really understanding hybrid, might
working across diﬀerent environments in a seamless fashion not making people run
two environments next to each other into what we're doing with multi-cloud. And so
I think we have great wisdom to bring to bear on that. And if we -- from the
infrastructure perspective, we've been doing Azure Stack for a long time, where you
can literally bring Azure infrastructure anywhere. Now, what's moved is, we now can
do that at the software layer, may this technology called Azure Arc, and essentially it
enables the software capabilities of cloud to be run anywhere as well.
So it's just matching the infra and the software, so the data services, the developer
services can also be move around. Today the most exciting things customers like
great I can run at in my on-prem and my cloud, like that's the most common. But I'm
starting to see more of like, I think, I can run Azure SQL over in diﬀerent clouds
compute. Okay, I'll do that. Then -- and lots of diﬀerent reasons, reality of enterprise
customers are complicated, and have lots of nuances and so this is just ﬂexibility for
them to do that.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes, deﬁnitely. I mean even going back to your Virtual Bill 2020, there's a lot of buzz
around Azure. I just wanted to spend a moment on that maybe help investors
understand sort of what Azure Arc is? Why is it important? And you touch on a little
bit, but what does it enable customers to do kind of moving forward?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

Page 10 of 13A - Julia White
Q - Philip Winslow
A - Julia White{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. No, I'm glad you asked, because it is a bit of a complicated area, right? So
people can be like, what are you talking about? So what Azure, I break it down, its
two things, right? The ﬁrst thing is it Azure Arc literally takes the management, the
control plane of what's my policy is what kind of how do I manage my virtual
machines and my services and it extends it out of Azure, so what you use to manage
all your resources in Azure, we use extend it out, so you can do that anywhere. So it
can be the same way you manage by sits on premises, they can be the same system
manages. What systems run in AWS, as an example.
So it just extends Azure management plan. So you're setting policies globally, you're
selling resource allocation globally. So that's the ﬁrst part. But because then have this
management plan that extends, what enables it to do is second thing which is we
call Arc enable all of our Azure software. So all of our managed services can run with
that management plan, which means wherever as Arc presides, we can take our
Azure services. So Azure SQL database, Azure PostgreSQL database, Azure
Kubernetes service, can then also run wherever you want.
So again, comment is like, hey, I want to run this on the Edge device in some other
location, right? I want to run it on-premise. So I want to have a distributed out model.
I want to put some of my data services or sitting in a diﬀerent cloud that type of
ﬂexibility is what it enables. So that's the core of what it is and it just to make it real
because it's conceptually (inaudible), they're one of the world's largest medical
equipment suppliers, right? They -- what they've done is use Azure Arc to deploy
updates consistently at scale from Azure to all of their medical equipment, this
distributed all over the world, right? And during the pandemic they needed to
quickly update, imaging, diagnostic equipment those type of things and they could
do that remotely. And so there is a way to get manage from one place, but not
across all of your systems.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
All right. Well, we got ﬁve minutes left and let's shift to the Edge. As I mentioned
earlier, a big fan of Edge stuﬀ. Why don't you give us just an update if you think
about intelligent AIs, where we are sort of in the life cycle of intelligent agent? How
do you think about the opportunity for Microsoft and for Azure?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, I think as you talked about it was an early idea, but that's we're now
becoming a bit more the new normal. And I was thinking about it like, it's hard to
think about an application being built today, that doesn't have some combination of
cloud and edge technology, right? Maybe people don't talk about it that way or
think about it that way, but a manufacturing plant, right? You have all these
connected systems and it's you -- of course, using cloud for data and analytics.
Even like big company we work with has their few their gas pumps at the fuel station
can connected so they can check for safety is someone smoking while they're
pumping up their gas like those kind of things as Edge compute working with theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 13Q - Philip Winslow
A - Julia Whitecloud compute or retail shelves and notify people that are out of stock, cloud and
edge, contactless delivery systems, smart appliance and all those things are just
examples of Cloud and Edge application patterns, some of the code is sitting on that
Edge device, a lot of the code is sitting in the cloud and are working in concert with
each other.
So if you think about it that way, it's very evolves. Again, the networking part of it as
5G emerges as we get that it'll become more and more capable to do those really
ultra-low latencies requirements as well. So that will also be another two point
unlocking of that next step function. But as I think about the maturity there from the -
- there's edge device maturity and that certainly happening and, we're help -- trying
to help the industry with things like Azure sphere that is world-class security even on
MCU devices ability to run full AI models on very small devices. They're getting high
performance. They're getting secure. They're getting cheap. That unlocks that edge
part of it and then from the cloud perspective, right? Our investments in IoT services,
AI services things like Azure Arc make that possible. So I'd say we are now into --
we're not that mainstream on this thing, but it's pretty much the kind of the new
normal as we move forward.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. It kind of feels like it's becoming more real. I mean every time you're thinking
about, the year after such a sort of unveiled Azure (inaudible) edge to intelligent
edge. You sort of have examples of a drone scanning pipelines looking for cracks or
you're like -- you're starting to see and that was only just a year later. It's a sort of
seeing how it evolved now you hear about examples of drones forums in Africa
because just not doing that on the stage at build, but actually really happening in
real life and so it's pretty incredible. The one question I have to - is one of the things
we talk about is potentially sort of a company almost like a three tier model, you're
potentially evolving where you've got the centralized via cloud Azure you've got the
device itself they decided the Azure ITS [ph] maybe it's like running (inaudible). But
we've also talked about sort of like the edge of the Internet and this goes back to
your kind of your network question. It could be a point.
How do you think about called you a more distributed your footprint, because
obviously, we talked about hyperscale when it comes to Azure, but then you also
think about the device itself. Maybe it doesn't have enough compute power, but the
centralized cloud images too late. Is there something it's kind of an in-between
there? And then how do you think about sort of the distributive footprint for Azure
relative, let's say, when an edge or CDN vendor might be doing?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. Well, you've certainly seen us continue to expand our global regions over 60
now and we're not slowing down. And so -- and that is for multiple reasons, but one
is having beyond the serve, our customers were locally, where they sit from a
performance perspective, but also from a data set, data privacy, data governance
capability, which has also become increasingly important. So both of those drivers
are what's really the catalyst for our continued global expansion into very broad
regions of the world. So that's going to be an important part certainly our work inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

have it working with the operators around our edge zones us, our own edge zones.
So continuing to expand even what the region looks like certainly continue to see
that if all this well.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Well, now okay we only got two minutes, but I couldn't pass up this opportunity to
ask this question, the -- obviously, we've seen every reason (inaudible) market and
Azure (inaudible) you can play with Xbox exercise with Microsoft's strategy where
they call it, content is king with game pass. Maybe we talk about you (inaudible) you
can play a role here?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. Well mean Xbox is possible with Azure and so this to me is an awesome one
Microsoft thing where from a gaming perspective, we -- our vision is to reach 3
billion gamers on the planet and we want to make the Azure the platform for it that's
best for building game developers, right, like building your next fantastic game. And
so Xbox from kind of world-class game streaming experience and the Xbox game
past, leveraging Azure behind that obviously makes Azure better and even things
about like our Xbox game studios, Minecraft, Halo, Gears of War all being built using
Azure makes Azure even more capable, but also helps reﬁne and think about what
we oﬀer from the game streaming perspective. So it is a place where being a ﬁrst
party in this gaming area actually is a wonderful kind of synergy with the platform
powering it underneath. And this is interesting thing too, it's not super useful in
gaming, but some of these -- some of the most high performance low latency
applications on the planet, right? The people's -- gamers tolerance for any of that is
zero. And so, it really pushes the platformer, really pushes Azure, but it's also great
for, if you want to run the NASDAQ on the cloud, gosh, it has, similar types more
types of requirements and so it does have transferable beneﬁt to broader industry
versus just gaming.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
All right. Awesome. Well, that was super informative our 30 minutes went very fast.
We touched a lot of things here thankfully both of us talk pretty fast, but we were
able to cover a lot. But Julia, thank you for joining us virtually. Like I said, super
informative, and that we talking too.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Awesome. Thank you so much for having me.
