{BIO 16211528 <GO>}
Good morning, everybody. We're going to get started with our next session here this
morning. Thank you, all for attending our UBS Tech Conference again this morning.
My name is Steven Chen -- I am one of the research analysts here at UBS. It is my
pleasure to welcome NVIDIA to our session this morning. We have got Colette Kress
today from NVIDIA. She is NVIDIA's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Oﬃcer.
Thanks, Colette, for joining us today.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thank you, Steven.
{BIO 16211528 <GO>}
So I thought we'd just host a ﬁreside chat this morning, go through a couple of
question-and-answer sessions. Then maybe if there is any time, we will see if there is
any questions from the audience.
So congrats on being at NVIDIA for a year. Seems like you have put a lot of new
programs in place, such as the capital return program, integrating the product
architectures, especially with the convergence of the GPU architectures. And
diversifying some of your market exposure.
Maybe you can just give us a quick recap to begin with of where the Company
stands in terms of maybe some of the changes you have implemented. I see you
guys have reported earnings last week. Maybe just a broad picture of where we are
at to start with.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-18

Sounds great. So we did -- we reported earnings about a week ago, indicating our
Q3 ﬁnancial results for the ﬁscal year. And a real strong quarter in terms of we
ﬁnished with record revenue. At one point, $2.2 billion. And 15% growth year over
year.
So far, year to date, in ﬁscal year 2015, we have grown 15% year over year over this
period of time. And within the Q3, again, really focusing on proﬁtability of growth.
Our overall diluted EPS for the Q3 year over year grew more than 55%. So we are
really pleased with the overall results. We are kind of breaking that down in terms of
what we saw in terms of the businesses.
Our real focus is along three key platforms. And where we saw growth was across all
three of these three platforms. The ﬁrst one being our PC business, which is a
particular part of our core. Our core as it relates to our gaming industry as well as our
design. So two areas in terms of GeForce and Quadro.
Very strong growth in terms of our gaming segment year over year within the
quarter, growing about 36%. And this is largely due to our release of our Maxwell
architecture that we released within the quarter. And the adoption of that quite
nicely in terms of the overall gaming as a tremendous improvement for the overall
gaming universe.
Our second platform, being datacenter and cloud, also did extremely well. We again
hit another record quarter in our overall Tesla business, which is for high
performance computing, parallel computing. And some of the aspects of new
machine learning that we are seeing.
Our overall mobile business also a very strong quarter, growing year over year,
associated with all of our diﬀerent SoCs. SoCs in a lot of our diﬀerent mobile
platforms, from tablets to phones as well as our most mobile type of platform, the
automobile, which saw about a doubling year-over-year growth in terms of our
automobile.
So we are really pleased with that transformation of not a chip type of approach. But
really a platform approach that we have done across here. And I think that takes a lot
of work over the last couple of years, really working with the end customers who
think about gaming.
Or if we think about the datacenter and we think about what we want to provide to
the consumer on the mobile, really reaching out and establishing the software
around that and what it means for the ecosystem to grow. So we are very pleased.
{BIO 16211528 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-18
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 14Colette KressOkay. Thanks for that introduction. Maybe we could follow up with some of the
comments you just mentioned on the platform strategy.
In terms of NVIDIA transforming from a chip company into this platform-type
company, could you tell us where you think we are, using the baseball analogy of
how far along we are in terms of taking the product through all these portfolio
changes in addition to some of the software resources and the diversiﬁcation of
sales into some of these stickier revenue opportunities.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So deﬁnitely a focus of ours. When we thought about the amount of innovation
that we have built into the overall GPU and the GPU from its overall visual
capabilities as well as all the compute. Really expanding into markets that can really
leverage that capability.
We have experienced that from the overall gaming side. And to really kind of talk
about that further, gaming is a extremely popular, probably 10% to 12% growth, type
of industry each year. But it is not about just providing that overall GPU.
The amount of work that we have built over the years working with gaming
developers on the new games that reach the market, which are, again, higher and
higher needs in terms of the GPU. We have worked the background in terms of that
ecosystem, such that when the user actually puts in their GPU, it works seamlessly
with those new games.
It takes into account the features of the game, the conﬁgurations that would make
that experience the most valuable to the gamer. Gamers appreciate that. It is a very
well-known brand recognized GeForce around the world.
That if you want to do the great PC gaming, GeForce is there because of that
background work that we have done. Not in terms of building a chip. But all of the
software that goes with the overall boards as they use it for their overall gaming
experience.
We can take that same concept as we move into design and we think about all the
diﬀerent uses that people are using the GPU to design everything that we have in
the world. In terms of almost all of the cars, all of the planes, all of the buildings are
usually built using GPUs for that rendering and that aspect, because of the work that
we have done with the software developers, the applications, to make sure that that
works seamlessly from generation to generation, that they can continue to use that
design.
We move, then, into the datacenter. And there is an extension as well of working with
the key applications in high performance computing, the parallelism as well as our
ability to program the overall GPU with our CUDA development platform that hasFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-18
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 14Steven Chin
Colette Kressallowed us that stickiness and being able to solve customers' problems in the
datacenter.
We move to our mobile area and really taking what we have learned from the
gaming experience on the desktop to a more mobile experience as well has really,
really beneﬁted us as well in some of the high end tablets for use in mobile gaming
has been just tremendous.
And lastly, our automotive. That is eight years in the making of working across that
industry, working with manufacturers on building the next generation of cars. We are
talking about a signiﬁcant amount of algorithm software and the technology for both
safety and security as it goes into the car.
So we are really pleased with how that long-term relationship has really beneﬁted to
us right now.
{BIO 16211528 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks for that overview on the platform strategy. Maybe to drill down a little
bit more into the individual segments here, just starting maybe with the PC GPU. You
spoke a little bit about how the platform approach is changing the way that you do
business in this PC market.
Maybe you could expand a little bit on the implications to pricing and also margins
for the GeForce products, given that some of these PC OEMs are less than a quarter
of your GPU business. Are you depending more on the retail channel as well as prior
years?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So what Steven is referring to is our overall GPUs for desktops and notebooks.
Again, being a signiﬁcant part of our core, we segment that between what we
believe people are using for a use case of gaming and what we believe is just for a
general overall PC.
The volumes and the price points that we see in terms of a gaming aspect has
continued to be a very important part for us in terms of our overall revenue growth.
That is an area where not only is the PC gaming community extremely vibrant. But
they are using more advanced GPUs for a better experience. It is not all about
gaming personally -- it is actually now about watching others game in that arena.
And so that is really, really a interesting sport around the world in terms of what that
has expanded to.
In those areas, we hold a extremely strong market share in the gaming in Asia Pac,
China, many of the parts of Europe, as well as in the US. And what we see is what
they may have started in terms of a GPU and gaming at a price point earlier, several
years ago, they continue to buy more and more advanced GPUs for better ASPs overFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-18
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 14Steven Chin
Colette Kressthat period of time. So we are seeing a mix really to that high end as one of the best
overall platforms to do their gaming in terms of on the PC.
Now when we think about the overall PC OEM, a little bit of a diﬀerent dynamic.
Again, our approach really from a platform strategy is not to attach to every single
PC around the world, because as we know. So many of the diﬀerent PCs are used for
so many diﬀerent types of opportunities. But we remain tremendously competitive in
the overall attach rate in a general purpose PC or notebook.
When we look at the overall notebook business, this is, again, a lot of movement to
buy a more mobile platform, particularly in the gaming world, where you had seen
gamers previously stay within their living room. Now they are ﬁnding that the
eﬃciencies of our new GPUs really allow them to experience that also on a
notebook. And we discussed again in Q3 our overall notebook business for gaming
growing almost double, as gaming notebooks are becoming a tremendous popular
and an interesting attach rate for us.
{BIO 16211528 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks for sharing that color on the PC GPUs. If we could just follow up on the
datacenter GPUs. In terms of GRID, it looks like some of the numbers would suggest
the test trials are up over 20 times versus the past two years, if we try to compare
some of our notes, that would be about just 1,000 now, perhaps.
Can you discuss some of the revenue conversion rates that you have seen from
some of these test trials over the past couple of quarters? And what is the typical
qualiﬁcation that a prospective customer goes through for these datacenter GPUs?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So let me start back in terms of our overall GRID platform. So a GRID is our
virtualized GPU. So diﬀerent from our one-to-one relationships with our current GPUs
on a desktop and notebook or on a server.
What we are talking about is multicurrency, concurrency of users reaching that
overall GPU that may be located in the server. So over a streaming environment, over
a cloud environment, access to the GPU.
So it is bringing in very unique use cases where that would be viable, both on a VDI
opportunity in the enterprise. But also in terms of a consumer streaming gaming,
becomes a very important market to think about.
Now the way we approach this was really certiﬁcation with each of the OEMs for that
GRID to take place in those diﬀerent cloud environments. But more importantly, was
working with key partners, such as Citrix as well as VMware, as those are some of the
key virtualization providers across the world on both the client aspect as well as the
backend server aspect.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-18
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 14Steven Chin
Colette KressSo over this period of time that we have had the GRID product available, we are
working with each one of those partners to develop the software within their
oﬀerings that will allow that GRID opportunity to work seamlessly across the
environments. The understanding as well as the adoption of that through the trials,
the interest, continues to grow more and more.
But with anything in the enterprise, the time it takes to start with one or two trials,
understand that, move out to a project -- to move out to broad availability does take
time. And in each case, I wish I had a speciﬁc time of how long that takes. But we are
solving some pretty important needs and, in some aspects, we see immediate
rollout.
In some aspects, it is a working with VMware, working with Citrix on the availability of
their software to where they can take part on that in a bigger, bigger type of
deployment.
So within this year, we are expecting tens of millions of dollars from GRID, which is a
great start for really being an only market for about a year. But it has a tremendously
strong outlook in terms of a growth provider, as that cloud enables quite a bit of a
unique ability for global teams to work and share visually important renderings
across the world in that scenario.
{BIO 16211528 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on GRID. Maybe just staying in the
datacenter GPUs, a question on Tesla, especially in the high-performance compute
application. That's also done very well for NVIDIA the past year.
So the question is, is this continued demand that you are seeing for Tesla, would you
characterize it from repeat buying or is it also new customers, perhaps new
applications? What are your thoughts on Tesla?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So Tesla has deﬁnitely been a great product over the last ﬁve years, focused in
high-performance computing environments for parallel processing. It has really been
a key understanding with the overall CUDA development platform to really take a lot
of that workload oﬀ of the CPU to the GPU in those environments. And that
continues to be a great growth opportunity.
But what is interesting is the expansion that has been happening over the last year as
the focus on machine learning, artiﬁcial intelligence. And really training the overall
applications and servers in terms of information. So Internet service provider or
cloud service providers around the world really focused on the amount of data, both
voice and video, traveling through their networks and wanting to really get a good
understanding on how to tag all of that diﬀerent information.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-18
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 14Steven Chin
Colette KressAs you see with many service providers the use of voice recognition. And voice
recognition across many diﬀerent dialects and many diﬀerent languages is very
important.
The use of the GPU to teach through those applications has been a very, very high
area of interest. It also moves in terms of video and picture tagging as well, meaning
can I recognize a dog -- a Labrador dog -- across a cartoon, a colored picture, or
some type of other artistic view of that.
So it is a very interesting ﬁeld, tremendous amount of research and high-end
education as well as with these Internet service providers that have driven
tremendous project growth for us in our Tesla business, allowing us to reach some of
the record levels that we have.
We are just in entering this initial, I think, phase of what machine learning and the
expansion of where it will be. But again, there is tremendous understanding in
research in terms of their capabilities.
{BIO 16211528 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks for sharing those thoughts on Tesla. Maybe to transition into the
mobile GPUs on the tablet front with SHIELD. The SHIELD handheld and also the
SHIELD products. I know Jen-Hsun likes to highlight some of the success with
SHIELD.
Given that is sold under NVIDIA's own brand name, maybe you could help us
characterize the demand for those products? What kind of your thinking is there with
SHIELD.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So our SHIELD family of products, including our SHIELD Tablet, is really a set of
products using our underlying mobile GPUs for the overall gaming industry. What
we have learned is our tremendous brand recognition and following in the overall
gaming market and wanting to move that to a mobile type of piece, there was no
better opportunity other than an overall tablet geared on our underlying technology
to take advantage of that.
So the reviews, the response from these tablets has been tremendous, in terms of
some of the best performing tablets out there in the market to take advantage of
that gaming experience. It is really an expansion -- a necessary expansion, as we
know, when you enter into a sport on a gaming, it is something that they want to do
everywhere.
You see more and more people doing this from a mobile aspect. So taking that same
experience that they are doing on the desktop in their living room, they do want to
move to a more mobile experience. As we have seen the expansion of AndroidFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-18
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 14Steven Chin
Colette Kressgaming and high-end Android gaming as well, we have really worked on building
that portfolio of Android games that go along with that experience to really beneﬁt
from the overall tablet.
So we are in the initial stages. Again, this is a new area for us to move into from some
of the places that we have been in the past. We are extremely pleased with the
overall demand. We are currently supply-constrained because demand is stronger
than our overall supply. And we will continue with the overall global launch of these
products set for the upcoming holiday season. And we'll talk about it more when we
ﬁnish Q4.
{BIO 16211528 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Thanks for those overviews on the products at NVIDIA. Sounds like you
have a lot of exciting opportunities going forward.
Maybe we could just transition to talking about some of the NVIDIA ﬁnancials.
Perhaps we could start on the gross margin. You have seen some pretty good
beneﬁts in gross margins, perhaps a favorable sales mix towards datacenter and
cloud. Is sales mix the right way of thinking of the driver to gross margin here in the
near term? Or are there other Company initiatives that you have going underway
that could also drive margins?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So I think mix is a good important part. It is not just our enterprise datacenter
and design products that overall drive our higher growth in margins but it is a key
point on that. As those have been growing and because they take place in so many
mission-critical types of applications, we are to beneﬁt from a very solid gross margin
that is better than the Company average for those.
Additionally, as people have been upgrading in the overall gaming side of our
overall ASPs, we have also beneﬁted from very, very stable and sometimes growing
gross margins in that arena.
The other aspect that we think about is on our Tegra side. The more software -- the
diﬀerent type of form factors -- we are talking about diﬀerent ASPs, we are talking
about diﬀerent gross margins kind of going forward. But probably more of a volume
play than an overall gross margin % on those pieces. So yes, the topline can be
aﬀected, particularly by the overall mix, which can help our gross margin.
But to focus really on the cost of the processing, we had discussed our uniﬁed
architecture about a year ago in terms of a single architecture that expands from the
desktop and the notebook all the way to our overall mobile platform. That helps us
both from the engineering expense. But it also does help us in terms of the costing
that it takes in order to build across our overall platform. So focusing on the cost
element as well as our overall ASPs allows us the long-term focus on gross margin as
healthy as we can possibly get it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-18

Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on margins. Maybe just a follow-up on the
investments in research and development. You spent some time speaking about the
investments in some of these platform strategies.
It sounds like maybe there is some investments needed in some of the software
features and perhaps before revenue starts. So maybe you could talk about how this
approach has worked so far with your R&D spending and perhaps what some of the
key investment areas are for the Company that we should think about.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. In ﬁscal year 2013 and ﬁscal year 2014, the expansion that we were needing to
do, as it focused on the datacenter and focused on many aspects of the enterprise in
mobile, took that time for building out that engineering to really concentrate on the
SoC and then also concentrate on the enterprise.
There is a tremendous amount of software development in almost all of our
products. Not well known is we actually have more software developers than we
have hardware developers at the Company, just based on the overall platform
approach that we have.
But moving into ﬁscal year 2015, it was time to really see that come through on the
overall revenue side and look for an overall eﬃcient base in our overall development
platform to be assured that we can maintain about ﬂat overall operating expenses in
ﬁscal year 2015 while overall seeing the beneﬁts on the topline. And we are really
pleased with that. As you can see with the year-to-date revenue growth of 15% and
proﬁtability exceeding 40% or more in any one quarter year over year, it is really
helped us out on the overall proﬁtability.
We continue to focus on areas of both eﬃciency. But also being assured that we are
continuing to invest in key platforms that have strong growth potential going
forward. And so it is really a balance of the eﬃciency against the areas of investment,
expanding into those datacenter, expanding into mobile, new partners, new sales
channels. All diﬀerent things that we have got to absorb within our cost structure.
So we will continue to focus on it. And it is a good amount of work on that. But we
are very pleased with the results we've seen so far.
{BIO 16211528 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks for sharing that on the R&D investments. Maybe just a follow-up on
some of that sales growth that you are seeing so far of the 15% year to date. Can you
maybe share with us how the intellectual property revenues or the licensing business
kind of ﬁts into the overall business model and ﬁnancials going forward?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-18

Steven Chin
Colette KressIt sounds like you will have a pretty balanced product solution business and then
perhaps the IP licensing business. If you could share some thoughts on that, Colette.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, I can. So about a year and a half ago, we had discussed our overall strategy
regarding IP and IP licensing. And the reason why was as the leader in terms of
graphic technology, we had a portfolio of about 7,000 issued and to be issued
patents. Probably one of the highest levels for the overall size of the Company we
are is really based on the overall leadership that we have in terms of the graphics.
It was an opportunity for us to articulate how we see that moving forward, from both
the ability for us to license our GPU core and our ability to license overall patents
that we may in terms of many of our diﬀerent customers.
So we have been in works for quite some time. One of the very well-known licensing
agreements that we have is with Intel that we signed earlier. They have access and a
cross-license to our entire portfolio of overall patents that we own.
As we move forward, post the announcement and discussions, as we have seen in
the last two months, we moved forward in terms of litigation against Samsung and
Qualcomm on the mobile space. Again, with a lot of IP, sometimes company-to-
company discussions do need to move to the next level. And that next level is about
determining to the extent of the ownership of the patents and use of the overall
patents.
So we did. We did move forward with the litigation. We are working right now on the
court hearing date with the ITC, which is planned for the end of June. So we are busy
working through. So we should have a good understanding after that in terms of
their determination of infringement and overall valuation.
So we think it is an important step in our overall IP strategy. But it is not the only step.
We are continuing many conversations with companies in many diﬀerent
conﬁgurations on licensing parts of our core, licensing our patent portfolio as we
move forward.
{BIO 16211528 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks for sharing that -- thoughts on the intellectual property. Maybe just
moving to the balance sheet and some of the capital returns to shareholders. The
program has been pretty successful so far, in our view. Maybe you can share your
thoughts of how to balance dividends versus share buybacks and how you think we
should think about return target as a percentage of free cash ﬂow from NVIDIA.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-18

Page 11 of 14Steven Chin
Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantGot you. So we're in ﬁscal year 2015. The Company had restarted their capital return
program at the end of ﬁscal year 2013. Fiscal year 2014 and 2015 was an intent to
return $1 billion in capital in each of those two years through a combination of both
our dividends and our share repurchases.
We were primarily in an aspect of that restarting is to return a lot of the cash that we
had received in many of the other proﬁtable years before that. So the $1 billion, for
the last two years, when looked at over 3 to ﬁve years, has been targeting about 75%
of free cash ﬂow over that period of time, which is in line with what you see a lot in
terms of in the industry and through our peers.
So we just ﬁnished our Q3 and we announced our intent for ﬁscal year 2016 as well.
So our ﬁscal year 2016 goal is to return $600 million in capital return and again,
keeping more in line with what we have seen as a percentage of free cash ﬂow over
a longer period of time.
At the end of ﬁscal 2014, in order to aid that capital return, we executed a convertible
debt oﬀering. And the primary reason was for the overall capital return. As we have
discussed, a signiﬁcant amount of our free cash ﬂow or cash ﬂow is earned in
international add back. So with the ﬁscal year 2016 program, we will have returned
almost all in terms of the leveraged approach that we had to restore that capital
return.
Focusing on the split between dividends and share repurchases. Our overall
dividend, when it started, we had targeted near where we wanted to be in terms of
peers and make a good solid introduction, as we knew the dividend would be here
for the long term.
So our dividend yield has ranged right now about 1.75% to 1.9%, in some aspects.
The remainder focuses on share repurchases in really twofold. One, overall share
reduction. But also keeping in mind our employee dilutive eﬀect of the RSUs that are
awarded. So we wanted to make sure we did more than just that overall dilution
eﬀect. We will continue to balance between the two as we go forward. But we have
set through what we want to do for ﬁscal year 2016.
{BIO 16211528 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Thanks for sharing that. Why don't we see if -- we have got a few
minutes left. Let's see if there is any questions from the audience.
Questions And Answers
(technical diﬃculty) Both obviously Tegra but as for the NVIDIA mobile eﬀorts at this
stage. (multiple speakers)FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-18

Page 12 of 14A - Colette Kress
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Colette Kress{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. So when we think about our mobile strategy, tablets -- remember, there were
two parts of tablets. There are specialty tablets in the market. We went to market with
overall Jammy and several other, Woohoo, very speciﬁc visualization types of tablets.
So that is still an important part -- very speciﬁc parts of the strategy.
Additionally, our SHIELD tablet, our own tablet, is also a product of that Tegra
strategy as we build a tablet speciﬁcally for gaming and more of an end-to-end type
of aspect.
The other components of our overall Tegra strategy outside of those tablets really
focuses on embedded types of robotics, drones. Embedded types of devices, where
it is really key in terms of the compute availability in connected overall devices that
may be mobile.
Our auto strategy is also a tremendous component. Our auto strategy has really
been focused on the high end in terms of the luxury types of brands that we have
seen over the last couple of years. Then this last quarter, we announced Honda in
Europe will also have Tegra K1 going forward in terms of the automobiles in the
European market, in more of the mainstream or midway.
And the other aspect that was extremely important in terms of that agreement was it
was based on the overall Android operating system. So we were the selected
hardware provider, along with the Android operating system. And this is one of the
very ﬁrst design wins really focused on that for the overall cars.
We have talked about our overall long-term Tegra for automobile as a very strong
pipeline, as we have been earning design wins over many, many years. And as the
automobile industry works, it is not a design win and the car is on the road in three
months. It actually can take a couple years, in some cases three or more years to take
that design to overall market. So we have remained extremely in a very good sticky
market on the overall automobile.
So I think there are specialty tablets on the Tegra side. There are also very, very key
embedded type of opportunities as we move forward and that continues to grow, as
also our automobile strategy, which I think is another key aspect of our Tegra.
(inaudible)
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So our focus on mainstream phones -- we have been pretty open about this, not
necessarily our focus of a mainstream, just standard overall phone. We still have key
design wins on phones that wanted to diﬀerentiate from many of the ones that are
out there. And we do have that optionality if they want an integrated modem or not.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-18

that is LTE. That LTE version uses our overall modem internally as well. So tablets still
can have that opportunity going forward. We provide that option with the best AP
that we can in terms of (inaudible).
Let's go back to the supply constraint you mentioned earlier. Sorry if I missed that, if
you discussed that on your call. But if you could run me through what -- did you just
underestimate the level of demand and then how quickly can you close that gap,
please? Thank you.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I think when you go to market, I think there is a very interesting time in terms of
feeling out that market. We knew it was a very, very great product from that aspect
and now we are talking about where that supply needs to sit around the world and
how do we get there.
We will solve that. We have deﬁnitely opened up the channels in order to do that
across. And we actually think it is a true positive in terms of seeing the demand for
the overall product. So we will wait and see in terms of this holiday. But the supply is
coming associated with that and we are just really pleased with the demand.
Thanks. Just back on the licensing deal with Intel. I just wondered whether you could
talk whether that's GPU core or the -- that they are using or intending to use and
whether it is the wider patent portfolio?

I'm sorry -- I didn't hear the piece of --
For IP licensing, I think you talked about the Intel deal that you have got. I just
wanted to -- what their intention are what your joint intention is in terms of product
use. Is it for the GPU core for mobile devices, for example, or is it the wider patent
portfolio of the 7,000 that you talked about?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. So our Intel licensing agreement is the licensing agreement that we have in
place right now that we began in 2011. It is -- it runs through to the First Quarter of
our ﬁscal year 2018 or calendar 2017, in that manner.
At that time, it is a question in terms of will it re-sign, will it re-sign diﬀerently, will it
not re-sign. But at the same time, we have many diﬀerent other types of agreements
of those interested in the overall GPU core, those interested in certain aspects of our
patent as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-18

forward. But there is many diﬀerent options in terms of that. But Intel is a part of what
we have right now as a stream and we will continue to expand that as we go forward.

So when -- we will discuss our overall product roadmap when it is usually here and
available. But of course, we are going to move in that direction on that side. So our
current products are still at 28. But you can expect us, just as others, that we'll move
in terms of that where it's necessary.

Okay. I think we are out of time, Colette. But thank you very much for joining us and
sharing with us your thoughts on NVIDIA.

All right. Thank you.
