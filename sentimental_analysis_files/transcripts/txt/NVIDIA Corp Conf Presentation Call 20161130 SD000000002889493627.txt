Perfect. Why don't we go ahead and get started, I'd like to welcome everyone to this
afternoon session. My name is John Pitzer, I'm semiconductor analyst here at Credit
Suisse. It's my distinct pleasure this afternoon to introduce Colette Kress, who is the
EVP and CFO of NVIDIA Corporation. We're going to go through a ﬁreside chat for
the next 20 to 25 minutes. We do have a microphone circulating throughout the
room. You guys have been a very bashful crowd today -- conference today. If you
have any questions, raise your hand, we'll make sure you get a mic.
With that Colette, let me start things oﬀ, my guess is there's not a lot of people in this
room that aren't somewhat familiar with the NVIDIA story. But it's always helpful in a
room like this, just in case to someone that is a little bit less familiar to spend a few
minutes just position the company. What's your core IP, the core end markets you try
to attack, your core strategy. I guess importantly, talk a little bit about how you do
things beyond just the chip level at the software ecosystem (inaudible) really
distinguishes you from a lot of those semiconductor companies.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, I think that's a good place to start. So our Company was founded on being the
leader in visual computing. But as we work through a key part of our transformation,
we started about four to ﬁve years ago, we are really focusing on being a GPU
computing company and what does that mean when you are new to a GPU
computing company. Before, we were looking for places, where a GPU, standing for
Graphics Processing Unit could be leveraged as a component in platforms.
The main component that we were a big factor on was obviously the PC platform
and probably our key most important application that we did at that time was
gaming. And moving towards that. But as we've transformed as a company, weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-30

Page 2 of 11John Pitzer
Colette Kressfocused on very key markets that we felt had tremendous growth potential in front of
them that were extremely hard problems to solve. And where the GPU would be
leveraged ever so uniquely for those platforms. Moving away from just being a
component. But being a platform that is incorporating the key GPU but also a
development infrastructure platform that incorporates development language and
many times our key design capabilities, libraries and frameworks that can be used
for each of these markets.
Our core markets today are gaming. It's still a signiﬁcant portion of our business,
represents about 55% of our business. But also pro visualization, we are essentially
taking that graphic processing capability to enterprise applications. Our third one is
the data center, which has many diﬀerent parts, which we'll talk about and also our
automotive business. And this in terms of our automotive today, is focused on
infotainment, where we're using computing graphics inside the center consoles. But
moving to the future in the strategy of self-driving cars and the overall AI platform
that's going to be necessary for those cars going forward. So those are our four
markets. What puts us in a unique position is that we have the ability to have a
uniﬁed architecture or essentially the same product for each one of those markets
that allows us to leverage or essentially invest in all four of those markets with one
signiﬁcant amount of operating expenses.
We probably have the most engineers on the planet singularly focused on the GPU
here at the Company. So the business is going well and that strategy has really
allowed us to expand into markets that are probably 10x where we were even three
or four years ago.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
That's a helpful start. I kind of want to drill down for each one of your four business
segments into some of the growth drivers. And gaming is probably a good place to
start at that because it's still sort of the largest of the four businesses that you're in, as
you said about 55% of the revenue. This has been a business that you've been able
to grow at a compound annual growth rate over the last ﬁve years of about 20% or
little bit greater than 20%. Now, I know this is not tied to new PC sales. But you did
that during a period of time where PCs are down almost 30% from the peak. Can
you talk a little bit about some of the drivers that are helping you to keep on that
CAGR and speciﬁcally ASPs as the biggest driver of that, because you probably had
better ASP growth than unit growth driving that CAGR over time.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Let me kind of talk about the gaming market. And the gaming market, which is
primarily for us focused on the PC. Yes. The overall PC market is enormous, more
than 300 million. But not necessarily a growth business. What we sell is the actual
gaming platform underneath that PC platform. Rarely, our sales in terms of the GPU
for this market associated with the PC. What is normal, people have a PC and
essentially just opening up and change their overall experience for gaming by
inserting a new GPU for that business. So overall business has been focused onFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-30
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 11providing a gaming platform for every type of gamer. If you think about many of the
other types of platform for gaming, you get one choice.
When you think about us, if you've got $100, if you've got $1000, we have something
to sell for you for that overall experience. What that allows us to do is really ﬁne-tune
working with the software developers and the game developers on better and better
games, games that essentially change based on what kind of GPU you actually have
in there. So our success over the last three years, about a half year ago, we had
calculated overall CAGR to be about 30% historically, much faster than the overall
PC market and there is literally both drivers inﬂuencing that, both from a unit growth
and also from an ASP growth. About half and half [ph] coming from that. But why,
why are the units overall growing in the sensitive PC platform because gaming today
on the PC platform is not all about just playing the greatest games, it's a social sport.
People are not sitting there alone, playing Pong back and forth, they're actually in
there because their friends are online. Their friends are on their side bars, their
friends are watching their game, you are watching other professionals play. Just like
any sport, it's essentially a sport in terms of gaming.
eSports have got people online, watching others in tournaments. If you think about
the wealth of videos that are on YouTube focus on how to play games. It's an
enormous business that's extremely healthy.
So people get the appropriate gearing [ph] or essentially they are having gamers
joining two by two, not necessarily one by one because it is to be there in terms of
social. We see expansion of broadband access across the world. We think that
everybody has all those broadband capabilities as we do in the US. But that
continues to grow. And they look at the western world or many of their sister
countries. And they want to be onboard with that overall gaming population. So we
continue to see that grow. The gamers continue to be gamers for longer period of
time. We have some of them over 40 years old but are still gaming, their
discretionary income there to buy whatever they need for their overall gaming
experience. Second, it comes into the actual games.
The games that they're playing online are multi-player types of games, multi-
strategic types of games going from volumes to volumes, franchises that have been
around for ten years, 15 years and they're on version 5, version 6. The more
complicated the game, the more complicated you see the overall graphics capability
and the rendering is going to be necessary for all of those diﬀerent scenarios.
Because of that additional production value of games, we need higher-end GPUs. So
that goes into the second piece of what we're seeing, higher ASPs. That's not a case
of price increase, it's a case that people are buying what they need for the types of
games that they want to play. They are buying higher-end GPUs.
And so on average, we are selling a higher price point in terms of that [ph]. The
fortunate piece that we're in right now is, we just launched our recent Pascal
architecture, which is also a very big inﬂuence, probably one of the largest increases
in terms of performance from the last generation is what you can see in Pascal. What
that means is gamers' performance per dollar is tremendously higher. It's a greatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-30
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 11John Pitzer
Colette Kressopportunity to buy. We exited [ph] the market over the last four to ﬁve months with
more than six, seven diﬀerent types of gaming cards unavailable and the great thing
about that is essentially anything above the $200 price point, you get to buy NVIDIA
because that's what's available for you. So it's going well. This last quarter, we did
60% growth in our overall gaming business and we're in the initial stages of the
holiday season.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
One of the questions I got after the October quarter was how should we think about
the channel, the transition from Maxwell to Pascal, both on an ASP basis and kind of
a channel ﬁll basis because clearly when you waterfall the new products out and
assuming the high ASP products are kind of ﬁrst to market, October quarter
probably beneﬁted the most from that. As you move into the January quarter, you
get volumes. My guess is the rich -- the mix kind of becomes a little bit less rich on
the Pascal side. So how do we think about channel ﬁll and sort of mix over the next
couple of quarters as you move from Maxwell to Pascal?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. With each of our lines that we've come out with, whether that would be Kepler,
whether that would be Maxwell, which is our last generation to Pascal, we've
continued to keep our customers on their toes in terms of what's coming up ﬁrst.
And what we've concentrated on, given that it is the exact same architecture across,
we have that opportunity to see that market in diﬀerent ways that we feel will -- both
beneﬁt the market. So there is no one said, hey, we want these ﬁrst for a diﬀerent
type of channel ﬁll because I want to concentrate a little bit here on the actual
channel.
Our channel is extremely important to us. These are partners that enable us to do a
deal because we're in terms of building the best architecture, we're not here in
terms of managing the day-to-day in terms of the channel. We have a great
relationship working back and forth on both understanding the demand, what we
believe is the demand and as well as what they're seeing locally, because if to grow
the growths [ph] that we have been it's really about a factor of every single region
growing, every zip code growing, every card that we've in terms of growing. So it's
not about channel ﬁll because (inaudible) number of our platform approach is, we
have designed a set of key drivers in software for every gaming card that goes out
there, we can see you light up, GeForce Experience is the experience that allows you
the latest driver for the next game that comes out. We want you online in gaming in
seconds. But we can see the games that you're playing, we can see what types of
cards that you are overall buying. So it's not a case of channel ﬁll because we can
also see them light up on GeForce Experience, which helps us again to concentrate
on where is the excitement in the market for gaming going forward. So the growth
that we have seen has been a seamless execution of moving from Maxwell to build
up in terms of what we have in Pascal.
I know we don't talk about it a lot. But that's a lot of 20 years of hard work to make
sure we can manage that very, very eﬀectively both for our channel partners that theyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-30

John Pitzercan see through nicely at the end of Maxwell and the beginning of Pascal.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
And when you say that Pascal is one of the largest performance improvements
you've seen generation to generation, can I replace that with ASP improvement as
well as those two things kind of track hand in hand?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I think we're in the early stages of Pascal. We're probably about four, four and half
months into what we're seeing in terms of the sales there. So I think it's a little bit
early to say, have we seen a signiﬁcant improvement more than what we saw in
terms of Maxwell or the other generations. But yes, average ASP so far has been a
driver of that growth, has been a factor -- a large factor of the growth as well.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Then another element of driving the gaming business in the October quarter albeit
smaller was the Tegra side of the business with the Nintendo Switch. How do we
think about kind of the initial builds for that and how should we think about
modeling that over the next three to four quarters?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So our relationship with Nintendo we can be more pleased about. This was an
opportunity to meet all of our key speciﬁcations of being inside a console. As much
as we love those overall console markets, we are focused on high-performance. We
are focused on a relationship where they can appreciate the underlying value of the
GPUs that we put through or in this case the SoC. Number two, which will be really
important is for us to work on that relationship, we know that it is semi-custom and
we need to have engineers 100% focused on making sure Nintendo's product is
great.
And we have done that and we have been working on that for some time for them to
be ready for the upcoming launch. Then number three, the business model was very
important to us that they appreciated the value of what we are producing and that
could be a win-win situation for both Nintendo as well as NVIDIA. So I can't be here
to announce the numbers because it's Nintendo's great product, it's a great product,
it looks really cool and we hope greater success for them. But yes, we are working on
ceding those SoCs for their upcoming launch.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
The other question I get from gaming from a growth perspective longer term is the
impact of AR and VR. I'm kind of curious from your perspective, do you guys look at
this as a separate sub-category within gaming or do you look it as an application that
continues along this path of higher ASPs over time?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-30

Page 6 of 11Colette Kress
John Pitzer
Colette Kress{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Correct. I think we would look at AR and VR as essentially the next generation of
gaming. Gaming today is more of a two dimensional, yourself with the overall
screen. As we move to the importance of virtual reality. We thought that it's getting
more and more realistic. And you can take on a diﬀerent character in terms of where
you stand within the game.
Hard work has been done for many years now to improve the overall technical
capabilities to allow VR and AR. What you need is you need that performance, the
ability for it to render at a speed that it is a pleasant experience from a virtual reality. I
think we're in the early stages of virtual reality. But we've gotten to a point where it's
a great experience with the opportunity to both increase the overall content now
that the underlying hardware is capable, as well as to probably improve the overall
form factor of VR so it can be in the hands of many.
We have focused our platform on enabling VR on a couple of ways. You'll see almost
all of our Pascal cards that come out are essentially VR ready. And we know there is a
likelihood, if you're going to come and buy a card, it's going to be a factor in your
mind that says, wait, am I buying this so I will be able to do VR at a later point. That
doesn't mean that they're going to be spending 100% of their time on VR. But even if
they're going to spend 10% to 20% of their time on both new games for VR and old,
they want to be ready and that's a factor in the types of cards that we believe that
they're choosing today. So no, it's not a separate category. I think it is an extension of
where that next wave of gaming will go.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
And my last question on the gaming front is just on the competitive side. You guys
have done a great job over the last several years, taking share in the marketplace.
But you see AMD, your largest competitor coming back into the market this year with
Polaris. They've done a roadmap for Vega next year. If you look at the third-party
data, they actually on a unit basis took some share back earlier in the year; hard to
ﬁnd out on a dollar basis or a proﬁt basis. So how do you think about the
competitive market with AMD coming back in with new product?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So AMD and NVIDIA are two ﬁrms that have been together for quite some time. We
however took a diﬀerent approach, probably about ﬁve years ago. We are not here
to be a component and inside of some type of PCs. We have taken a hold of
determining what that end customer, what that gamer is looking for and we use our
OEMs to help us see that market. So right now, I think we have established a very
high performance level for what we think is the type of gaming that people want to
do. And I think we're initially seeing that being well received.
I think they've got some ways to go. But I think we're excited to be running around
the track with somebody else. I think it makes you run harder. I think it's more fun.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-30

Colette Kress{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Perfect, switching gears to data center. 10% to 15% of the business today,
tremendous growth story. If you go back over the last three years, you've gone from
a $200 million annual run rate to now a $1 billion annual run rate. Can you help the
audience sort of understand to what extent is this being driven by better penetration
within the supercomputer HPC market versus new workloads especially around AI?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So I think it's good for us to kind of introduce what's in our data center business. It
seems very -- kind of simple to talk about. But there's actually quite a bit of
complexity in diﬀerent areas in there. We exactly have about ﬁve diﬀerent markets
with -- inside the data center business. You spoke about the overall high-
performance computing market, that has been an area that we've been focused on
for more than 10 to 12 diﬀerent years in terms of growing that business. Those are
areas, where mathematical computations need to be completed that are well known.
But using an accelerator such as a GPU, taking workloads oﬀ of the CPU and travel
through the GPU can speed up those workloads.
You can think about many large data center would beneﬁt from getting the work
done faster. So most of the largest supercomputers in the world and the Top 10
applications in high-performance computing are now using accelerated computing
using GPUs. And that continues to be a very important growth market for us and is
growing quite well. But that has expanded us into some other markets. The second
one that we talk about is actually a GRID, which is our virtualization.
That is a case, where you want to leverage in the VDI environment, the use of a GPU.
So instead of a one-to-one relationship between yourself and the overall PC, we've a
one-to-many to where the GPU is in a cloud environment, if you're interested in
streaming down your application, streaming down your overall compute, we now
have the capability with the software layer to virtualize that GPU for that experience.
That makes up approximately about 10% to 15% of our business in that space.
We've been working tremendously with Citrix and VMware and others to continue to
build out that market because we signiﬁcantly improve the user interface. So that
breaks down to what is the rest, what is really some of the fastest growing pieces in
there and that's our three types of areas of artiﬁcial intelligence. This is ﬁrst started
oﬀ after many years of working with many of the high-end hyperscale’s around the
world. Now, why and why would the hyperscale’s be focused on this? They have a
signiﬁcant amount of data. They have a signiﬁcant amount of data of all diﬀerent
form factors running through the networks. And what they're trying to do for us is to
make the applications that they provide us to work better. These are things such as
search, these are things in terms of image deduction, this is things in terms of video
transcoding. These types of things are very important to us.
As you've noticed, your search command seems to be getting smarter. But the reality
is there's artiﬁcial intelligence behind the scene. The GPU has been uniquelyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-30
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 11John Pitzer
Colette Kresspositioned and available to expand the use of artiﬁcial intelligence with frameworks
referred to as deep learning frameworks. Those deep learning frameworks are
frameworks working with (inaudible) is allowed to take a signiﬁcant hundreds of
millions of data points and infer what the answer is. Diﬀerent from high-performance
computing, do you know the answer? This is after signiﬁcant amount of data, the
actual accuracy of that information will be better.
So the hyperscale’s have been moving to when you speak into your phone, better
battery performance in terms of translating your information and returning back in
millisecond in terms of what you need in terms of response. Those works have gone
application by application, workload by workload in the hyperscale’s. We've
continued to advance to almost every single or if not all hyperscale’s on the planet in
terms of working with them in this environment of AI.
Number two, the hyperscale’s are also working for availability of AI to the masses. As
we know, we are now in the evolution of cloud computing and the importance of
being able to just go online and get a cloud instance, one that is generated with the
GPU behind that. So we now have whether you can use the GPU for computing, our
researcher wanting to do AI can go up to AWS, Microsoft, Google and others to
overall do that. That's another key growth area of AI.
And the number three, as we continue to expand out to diﬀerent industries. And we
extend out into many of the parts of the enterprise. And a process with large sets of
data, you can now buy a supercomputer, AI supercomputer for us called DGX-1. It
comes with eight GPUs, comes fully enclosed with all of the storage, all the memory
as well as a development layer and a software layer. We plug it in and we get started
in terms of our AI. So those are our ﬁve diﬀerent businesses in terms of data center.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Drilling down the AI, I think one of the things that everyone in this room is struggling
with is trying to quantify the market opportunity over time. I have a couple of
questions along those factors. First, how do we think about AI with the GPU versus
an FPGA versus an ASIC accelerator. Do you feel as this GPU is suitable IP to attract
the entire AI market. When do we think about the architectural diﬀerences between
using a GPU, FPGA and ASIC to do that AI computation?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. We have been uniquely positioned for some of the initial and continue to work
in artiﬁcial intelligence, mainly because of the work that was done on deep learning.
And creating deepening frameworks.
The overall use of a GPU has been well positioned because of its overall
programmability, the openness of accepting every single one of those diﬀerent
frameworks that is out there. (inaudible) we will work with them. We've continued to
not just focus on the underlying hardware in that case, which remember to do AI,
we're talking about a signiﬁcant amount of data, a signiﬁcant amount of processingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-30
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 11John Pitzer
Colette Kress
John Pitzerand a signiﬁcant amount of processing that needs to happen at the same time in a
parallel standpoint for it to be eﬀective. Waiting a week for the information or answer
to come back. So that you could tweak it to get to even a better answer is not an
overall value-added process. So the GPU is uniquely situated in those cases. There
are and there will be other diﬀerent form factors. I do believe AI computing is an
evolution that will probably be with us for the next 10 years to 20 years. And there
will be many diﬀerent form factors through that. But it doesn't mean they can all
perform the same type of work.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
One of the ways -- I don't know if this is correct or not. I would like to get your
opinion. But there seems to be a perception out there that there is two parts of the
AI market. There is a training and there's the inference. And for training, a GPU is
particularly well suited. We're still very early in the training market. But people are
concerned as you move to inference that perhaps you don't need as the high
performance chip and people will move to a diﬀerent sort of architecture. One is
that's too simplistic and two, as the world moves from training to inference, will you
have sort of product available that's sort of optimized for that inference market as
well.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I think that's a good place to start. Let's say for training, we're not exactly seeing
anybody use anything else but a GPU, just because of a signiﬁcant amount of
performance that's necessary. Even if we move to inference, there is a continued set
of cards, chips, whatever that we're putting together to enable the consistency from
the training environment, the algorithms that are there to the overall inferencing
process. But inferencing is going to be wide and broad.
You can be doing inference using your refrigerator, using your thermostat. That is
probably going to be a small, watered, very simple functioning type of AI device.
That's not necessarily something I agree that you would necessarily need a GPU. But
that's not what we're going to concentrate on. There is a signiﬁcant amount of
beneﬁt that we've already seen in terms of an inference using the GPU in terms of
the speed in terms of that piece of conﬁrming your overall training environment that
you've done as well.
You've already seen us come out with the P4 and the P40 as well. Much, much
smaller, small size ﬁtting into existing architectures, allowing you to scale out, scale
up and providing that even at energy eﬃcient type of use. So we all approach that.
But it wouldn't surprise us if there is diﬀerent types of pieces along there. But it's
going to be probably a sizable market for all. But we'll continue to do our expertise
of bringing the computing platform together for that.

(inaudible) some of the markets that you have been attacking. So some of the
applications actually ﬂow back to Intel?
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Just for people on the webcast, the question was just how do you view Intel Xeon Phi
or Nirvana acquisition relative to the competitive front?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So lots of diﬀerent types of competition there. I think it's important to note that
even though it may be referred to as an FPGA versus GPU, they are not the same.
There can be very likeness on that. But GPUs performance level is tremendously
diﬀerent than anything that we have seen FPGAs have been around long time as
well. And not necessarily the growth. We don't have a case that we know that FPGAs
are being used in the deep learning training types of environments. It is actually
challenging to think about designing on an FPGA or reconﬁguring on an FPGA. So
Intel is probably working on many diﬀerent types of strategies. You see them with
Xeon Phi, you see them with FPGAs, you see them with diﬀerent acquisitions and all
things that are referred to as coming soon. We're here focusing today. We're here
focusing today because the customers are here today.
We're focused on not trying to determine what type of hardware because we know
that. We're here to focus on that infrastructure development work that needs to be
for each of these diﬀerent markets. We have been working with the ecosystem
building out the libraries, building on top of the frameworks and assisting the speed
at which AI wants to go and not with we're focused. Again they have the capabilities
I'm sure to do that. But we just haven't seen them develop a cohesive piece together
that can serve some of the most important areas that we see that are signiﬁcant
today.
