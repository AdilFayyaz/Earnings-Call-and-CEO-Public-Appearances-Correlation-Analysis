Thanks, Anurag. Hi, everybody, thanks again for joining us today. So, my name is
Stacy Crook, and I'm a Research Director with IDC's Internet of Things Ecosystem
and Trends Research Practice. The IoT Ecosystem and Trends Research Practice is
IDC's umbrella program for IoT that looks at the market holistically and really looks
to understand how the IoT ecosystem is evolving. But I also do a lot of work, looking
at the IoT platform space in particular, so we will dive into some speciﬁcs on that
segment of the market today after we sort of go through an overview of what's
happening in the industry.
So in terms of the agenda today, we'll again sort of take a look at the big picture for
IoT in 2018. We'll put some numbers around it, so we'll look at the worldwide IoTFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-17
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 2 of 14opportunity, we'll also look at the IoT vendor landscape from a macro perspective,
and then we'll dive into the IoT platform market, speciﬁcally.
So I talked about this idea of IoT being an ecosystem, and the reason that we need
to think about it from an ecosystem perspective is the fact that there is a complex set
of technologies and services required to make this happen. So, we think about IoT
from an enterprise perspective, think about all the decisions that they have to make,
right. You ﬁrst have to think about what are the things that we want to connect and
those things could be anything from a chipset to a module to an industrial assets to
a consumer device or consumer goods, such as a refrigerator. Then we have to think
about what kind of connectivity do we need and there's a lot of options there as well,
everything ranging from cellular to some of the new low power wide area
technologies, to WiFi, to satellite, to even ﬁxed connectivity is still very much part of
our IoT implementations.
Then we need to think about the infrastructure that's going to support that
implementation, so this could include things like gateways and routers and other
pieces of equipment that we need. Then we have to think about the software
components of the stock. The IoT platform will help us to build and manage
applications, as well as managing the devices themselves and you have to think
about how are we going to gain intelligence from our data, so there is an analytics
layer that goes into this. And then also there will be IoT speciﬁc applications that are
oriented towards horizontal and vertical use cases.
And then we have to think about how do we bring this all together, so we see IT
services providers as playing an important role in this ecosystem from a consulting
perspective, from an implementation perspective, providing managed services,
support services, so we really need them to be this kind of glue that can help us tie
these solutions together.
And then we have to think about security and that really has to be considered
holistically across this entire stack. So there is really a lot that organizations have to
think about when they're looking to deploy IoT technology.
If we think about some of the key themes that we're seeing in 2018, we ﬁnd that
budgets are starting to be earmarked for IoT projects and often this is happening
within the scope of broader digital transformation initiatives. We do a survey every
single year where we ask close to 4,000 IT decision makers worldwide about their
plans for IoT. And, in 2016, we found that 30 something percent of organizations had
a budget in place for IoT projects. When we did the same survey in 2017 that
percentage had jumped about too close to 70%. So that is a huge spike in one year
and it really shows that organizations are starting to take this seriously.
We also ﬁnd that the market opportunity is increasingly becoming used-case driven
and, therefore, vendors are sort of narrowing their strategies to become more
focused on various vertical industries and various use cases that support the needs
of that industry. We're ﬁnding that organizations aren't necessarily seeking out IoTFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-17
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 3 of 14technology, in some cases some verticals don't even refer to it as IoT but they're
really looking for IoT technology to support certain business call.
We see that cloud is the underlying enabling capability to IoT success, because it's
going to give us that scale, but increasingly we understand that the EDGE is also
taking on additional signiﬁcance. And we talk about the EDGE, it is this capability to
compute closer to the source of data generation.
Analytics and artiﬁcial intelligence are really at the forefront of the discussion. Today,
you go to any technology conferences and all you hear about is AI, AI, AI, but when
we talk about IoT it's really important to remember that there is other building blocks
that have to be in place before we can start applying any type of advanced analytics
on our data. We need to have the right connectivity, we need to able to manage our
devices so that we are getting reliable data from them and we have to make sure
that our implementations are secure from holistic perspective. We also see that there
is an increasing acknowledgement of these skill shortage and that this is holding
back IoT projects today.
When we think about some of the drivers and inhibitors for IoT investments. So we
touched on some of these challenges, but again in our survey every single year
security comes up as the number one inhibitor to IoT projects. We're really
increasing our potential attack surface by quite a bit when we extend out beyond the
traditional sort of IT perimeter, so we kind of went from the traditional IT perimeter,
then mobile devices, and now as we imagine the IoT perimeter, we're just really,
really increasing that surface area by a multitude.
Costs are always the second challenge to these projects when we think about an IoT
project. Again, there's a lot of piece parts that go into it. There is going to be a lot of
services that has to go into it as well. So there's a lot of upfront costs, but then when
we think about the ongoing cost, the connectivity as a part of this, right. So usually
there is going to be something, an ongoing costs related to the connectivity as well
as just the usual ongoing costs that are part of any kind of an IT project.
Privacy concerns are deﬁnitely being raised to the forefront with IoT when we think
about retail and the strategies to put beacons that can track our location when we
are in the store tracking perhaps demographics about who we are. These things are -
- bring up real privacy concerns. There is concern about technology stability and
capabilities, and I think that we're getting to a point in 2018 where there is becoming
more stability around that technology, but still we are talking about an emerging
space and so it is a signiﬁcant concern.
And, ﬁnally, we talked about the lack of skills and this is a challenge, there is a lack of
skills in terms of some of the embedded technologies that we need, there is a lack of
skills in terms of how do you bring the solution together, there is a lack of skills on
the analytics and data science side, and you really need all of this to bring those
solutions to market.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-17

Page 4 of 14In terms of the drivers, there is meaningful drivers in place here and that's why
despite the challenges organizations are planning to move forward with these
initiatives. So there is the opportunity to improve business productivity when we
think about this from, say, a manufacturing perspective, we could do dynamic
scheduling in our factory, predictive quality, more automation within the factory, the
ability to reduce costs. We think about Smart City, for example. If we have Smart
Lighting System that can save a lot on energy costs, same thing with the Smart
Building System.
Moving into eﬃciency for customers is an important driver when we think about the
supply chain. That improvements that we can make in our supply chain will impact
our customers downstream in that whole value chain. Internal maintenance costs, so
again we'll talk about manufacturing a lot in this session today, because it is sort of
the largest used-case that we see today, the largest vertical area of vertical spend,
and many of the biggest use cases come out of manufacturing. So, when we think
about, it is the opportunity to do predictive maintenance on our machines and,
therefore, save costs on maintenance.
And, ﬁnally, improving customer experiences. So we think about this from a retail
perspective. Yes, it's a little bit nerve-racking to think that something is tracking us,
but, at the same time, this is how we'll be able to have more personalized
experiences oﬀered to us. And then, also, we can also think about new service-based
products that can be oﬀered from IoT data. So instead of having to buy an asset, we
can buy a service to that asset.
So if we look at this from a spending perspective, we believe that IoT spending will
grow to $1.1 trillion in 2021 and it will be growing at a rate of 14.4% over the forecast
period. And I know that sounds like a really big number, but, again, we have to think
about all the diﬀerent technologies that are going into that spending. So there is a
hardware component, there is a software component, there is a connectivity
component, and then there's the services component as well. And we are tracking, I
think, close to 75 use cases in our IoT spending guide right now, but that's obviously
just one piece of the puzzle. There are going to be hundreds of use -- IoT use cases.
So this is going to be very, very pervasive and that's why we think that the number is
really going to be very signiﬁcant as we move through the forecast period. As we can
see, Asia-Paciﬁc lead spending with North America coming in second and EMEA
coming in third, and we'll speak to some of the regional trends on the next slide
here.
So, again, when we think about IoT spending, I'll touch on sort of some of the mega
trends that are driving the spending across the region and then some of the top use
cases across each regions. So in North America, really the mega trend here is digital
transformation. And one of the main drivers for adopting IoT within North America is
the need to reduce operational costs and this could be something like headcount
within an organization or fuel savings for our ﬂeet. And in North America,
manufacturing and transportation and logistics are the two largest use cases or, I
should say, verticals.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-17
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 14In Europe, process automation is really the top driver of IoT spending today. And
some of the key trends there are really the trends around industry for now. And in
Europe, our manufacturing is also the top vertical in terms of spending. But by the
end of the forecast period, we also see that consumer industry spending is going to
make up a signiﬁcant amount of spend in that region.
In Asia-Paciﬁc, improving internal eﬃciencies was the top driver of IoT projects.
Again, manufacturing is the number one vertical for spending in that region,
followed by utilities and transportation as well. And so, some of the trends in Asia-
Paciﬁc that are driving the spending there still have initiatives like Made in China
2025 certainly in the manufacturing space. There is also the fact that there's the kind
of rise of the middle class in Asia-Paciﬁc. In Japan, there's a lot of eﬀorts around
connected society. And so, as we go from region to region, we do see some
diﬀerences in what's driving IoT spending, but again manufacturing is kind of a
constant in terms of being that -- the top verticals of IoT spending across the world.
And now if we look at IoT from a vendor perspective, so as we discussed, the
technology sack includes a broad range of technologies, and so it's no surprise that
there is a lot of vendors that participate in this space. And we've broken it out here
into hardware, software services, standards bodies and industry solutions. And,
again, we've grouped it this way, but when you think about the way that organization
has to go about building an IoT solution, they have to make a lot of decisions and
there's a lot of diﬀerent vendors to choose from. So, I think that's one of the key
takeaways from this slide.
I also want to call your attention to the IoT platform component of this slide, which is
in the, sort of, right in the middle here. I think the important point here is, ﬁrst of all,
that it takes up a lot of real estate. It is a space that a lot of vendors are participating
in and the other point here is that, organizations cannot make an IoT platform
decision in a vacuum, right. They have to think about the hardware that they need to
connect to that platform, they need to think about the analytics that they're going to
leverage from the data they collect on the platform, they have to think about the
standards the platform supports, they have to think about what industry are they in,
are there speciﬁc industry solutions that they want to adopt to run on that platform
and how they're going to bring it together. So we'll get into the platform a little bit in
a couple of minutes, but just wanted to call attention to that on this particular slide.
So, again, when we think about IoT from a macro perspective, one of the questions
that we ask in that survey I mentioned year-after-year is, what type of vendor do you
think is going to be most likely to lead in the IoT? In the earlier days of ﬁelding the
survey, the hardware vendors, sort of, were more at the top of the list. And we've
seen this shift over the last couple of years where software and analytics vendors
have now risen to the top, and we believe that this is just market maturity taking
place, right. In the beginning of the market everybody was really thinking about what
are all the potential things that we connect and how are we going to connect them.
And now it's moving into, okay, so we may be have a handle on what are some of the
pieces of hardware we want to connect in the connectivity, but now we need to think
about, well, what is the end goal here, what is the insight that we want to gather fromFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-17
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 14the data. And so, now there is more attention being focused more on that software
and analytics component of the stock.
And so, the next question we asked was, okay, so you think that, for instance,
software vendors are going to be really kind of the thought leaders in the space and
the ones that are really making a lot of the money. So, who do you think is going to
make the money? And so, this is the result and we asked it by each of these diﬀerent
categories, so each person was able to sort of give their viewpoint on these
categories. And so, I think there's a couple of important points to take away from this
slide. First of all, asking about perception. And so, this is, again, perception versus
who was actually making the money right now? I think today -- as it for example,
from the software and analytics area, Google came up in number three, but Google
didn't actually have a commercial oﬀering for the key space until -- well, in the
enterprise side anyway, really -- have really focused product until 2017. So this is
more of the perception at that point that the Google could be a leader, and I think
that certainly some of that's being driven by what they're doing on the consumer
side with also the focus that they have around analytics and everything that they've
done with AI.
I think another, sort of, telling aspect of this is also Siemens on the OT side, where
they've really just began to kind of mature their commercial IoT oﬀering for market
over the last year, but they, from a perception perspective, were ranked number one.
So, I think it's very interesting to kind of understand who has -- this is really
interesting in terms of like think about who has the mindshare in the market and I
think that's our job to sort of track how the revenue shakes up over the next few
years in these respective spaces.
This slide also really reinforces the idea that IoT is an ecosystem and that no one
vendor can dominate the space entirely.
Okay. So now we're going to move into a discussion speciﬁcally around IoT platform,
and we really see the IoT platform as an essential component of the IoT stack. And if
you've been following the space at all, you may have heard that there are hundreds -
- I think the number that gets tossed around the last is 400 IoT platforms on the
market. So IDC doesn't quite look at it that way, because we have a bit more of a
narrow deﬁnition of what we include in the IoT platform space. And for us to be
classiﬁed as an IoT platform within our market sizings, the platform has to have a
connectivity component and a device management component.
Usually these oﬀerings have solid [ph] data ingestion, processing and management
mechanism as part of them, because once you connect to the device, you start
getting some of that data out of the device, you need to be able to ingest it and
store it and the processing piece comes in where do you -- where does that gets
stored or do you need to run an analytic on it in real-time.
Visualization tools are usually part of these platform products as well, because, again,
if you have this data you won't be able to visualize it. So those are kind of the fourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-17
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 14key components that we see making up an IoT platform, but it has to be all in one
product for us to consider an IoT platform. So, if it's just an IoT visualization tool, we
don't consider that a full-on platform, that is a IoT visualization tool.
Sometimes these products include application development tools, sometimes they
include advanced analytics. So if it's included in the pricing that we consider part of
the platform, if it's not, then we don't. In terms of architecture, we'll talk about this a
bit more in a minute, but we really think that these platforms have to support
distributed computing. We talked about this idea that the cloud is very important.
The cloud and, we call it, the core, because this could be any centralized data center,
it could be the cloud and it could be an on-premises data center, but it's a
centralized data center, that is not, say, on the mid, on the factory ﬂoor, in the
manufacturing -- for manufacturing, example.
Security has to sort of run throughout the stack. We don't see that as a kind of a --
there are standalone security products, but we wouldn't consider that an IoT
platform. For us, the IoT platform has to have security architected in, and then we
also think that the platforms increasingly have to have APIs to integrate with other
business systems, because a lot of times raw IoT data itself is not that meaningful,
you have to combine it with other points of context to make it meaningful.
So, if we look at the IoT platform from a vendor perspective, it's a crowded space
and it's interesting to look at this, because it maps nicely to that. That ﬁrst slide that
we showed, that sort of showed the IoT technology stack from these things to the
services. So we've got companies and vendors that makes things that ﬁt IoT
platforms. Again, this could be machines, this could be chip sets, this could be
cellular modules. We've got vendors that build network equipment in -- heavily
involved in this space. We've got vendors that run connectivity networks that have
platforms, and then we've got all the analytics applications cloud vendors that are
participating, and then the services vendors as well. And the services vendors,
sometimes they have a proprietary platform, but usually they oﬀer partner platforms
as well, because their focus is really on generating services revenue and it's less so
about having allegiance to any one speciﬁc software platform. It's more about
ﬁnding the right ﬁt for the customer.
And so, obviously, there's a lot of competition here. But if we think about it, we don't
think that there is necessarily a winner-takes-all strategy in the IoT platform wars. We
do think that there will be winners that emerge in each of those categories, but they
all have to play together, because when you think about it, nobody's in the vendor
landscape is really positioned to sort of lead across all of those areas, so they have to
partner. And we see the evidence of this and what's taking place in the ecosystem
over the last couple of years. There's partnerships across application development
cloud, EDGE, connectivity management and device management and I will talk
through a couple of these examples just to bring them to life.
So if we look at application development, AWS obviously oﬀers a number of web
services that are really the building blocks to build solutions. Salesforce brings the
customer contacts into that situation, so a customer might build their underlying sortFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-17
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 8 of 14of IoT infrastructure, software infrastructure, I should say, with AWS, but then if they
want to bring some points of context into their application, they might leverage
Salesforce's IoT solution in concert with that to bring. Again, we talked about the
idea of adding context to IoT data.
In the cloud space, one other things we've seen is that the organizations that are
really focused on the cloud infrastructure like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, they are
certainly focused on their own cloud strategy, but other vendors that do have some
cloud strategy but are less focused on the infrastructure piece of that are trying to be
more multi-cloud and give their customer's choice. So SAP, GE Digital, and PTC are
all examples of companies that are really trying to focus more on the platform-as-a-
service layer and they're partnering with cloud infrastructure providers. So that if
their customer wants to run their PaaS on a Google IaaS, they're able to do that
instead of having to run it on SAP's own cloud.
On the EDGE infrastructure side, we have got a number of organizations that
provide the gateways and the hardware, but then when you think about running an
application on that hardware, for instance, IBM has an SDK, so that you can run in
IBM IoT Watson application on a Cisco gateway.
In the connectivity management space, Cisco -- for this piece of it, we're talking
about Cisco Jasper. So Cisco Jasper has integrated with many mobile operator
networks around the world. So for an IBM or Microsoft, it doesn't necessarily make a
whole lot of sense for them to try to make that eﬀort as well, it makes more sense if
they have a customer that wants to do an IoT deployment with cellular to partner
with Ericsson or Cisco Jasper.
On the device management side, there will be a lot of partnerships, because there
are lot of diﬀerent providers of device hardware and who knows how to manage
those better than the company that originally manufactured the same, right. So
Bosch and IBM are good example of that, where IBM has partnered with Bosch on --
for Bosch's device management software.
So, again, there has to be partnerships across the space and I think that we've come
to sort of see the IoT platform is an ecosystem itself within the broader IoT
ecosystem, but there will be some key attributes of winning platform players. We talk
about ecosystem partnerships and like [ph] some will believe at that point, standard
support is really important. There's a lot of diﬀerent standards out there and you
need to understand which standards are important in your industry and support
them. It's really important to focus on use cases. Again, we don't see customers
necessarily going out and saying I want to buy an IoT platform, what they want is a
piece of technology that supports their use case.
It's going to be very important to have a developer ecosystem. Anytime we talk
about our platform, you want developers and you think cloud momentum is also
very important, because we talked about that scale, but also this is where a lot of theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-17
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 14developer interest is being pulled these days. So if you're a big cloud provider with
the strong developer ecosystem, that is only going to enhance your IoT strategy.
Analytics are really important, this is where we get the value from the data, so we
think the IoT platform players all need to have strong analytic strategies. They've got
to get pricing right. We've seen many IoT platform players slashed their pricing over
the last year up to 50%, because the pricing models were just too high when we
think about all the data that customers want to run analytics on and store. And IoT is
very global in nature as we talked about earlier, so whether you're a multinational
organization or you're manufacturer that shipping products all over the world, you're
going to have to think about global connectivity, you've to think about global
language support, global tech support, so these platform players have to really have
strong global capabilities.
Okay. So just ﬁnishing up here with a quick view on the future of the platform. So,
again, we really think that the idea of an EDGE to cloud or EDGE to core architecture
is really important, increasingly because of the cost to send everything to the cloud,
because of security issues, because of concerns around latency and bandwidth,
organizations are going to want to process more of their data closer to the point of
generation. So as a platform provider, you need to be able to support that
application wherever it needs to run.
We think that trends around containers and serverless computing are valuable to the
platform. Containers oﬀer portability, which is important when we're talking about
very heterogeneous endpoint environments. Serverless computing really allows us
to take an event-driven approach to IoT, which can save us cost if we're just spinning
up the computing when we see a certain event happen, instead of running all the
time. We also think blockchain is going to be an interesting technology with an
intersection to IoT for certain use cases like those around supply chain and track and
trace.
In terms of functional enhancements, we think that there will be more rapid
application development tools added to these platforms, because they allow more
people in the organization to participate in the development process. This idea of
digital twin and augmented reality taking the digital -- taking the physical world and
making it digital is going to be a really key trend in -- especially in Industry IoT, more
integration of the device, so that when organization wants to on-board millions of IoT
endpoints that makes that process simpler. We talked about contextual integrations,
it could be customer data, it could be weather, it could be location. Data
monetization tools, so that you can start to build new revenue models based on this
data. And then in terms of consumption, it's going to go two ways. On the one hand,
it depends -- and it depends on who is buying the platform. If it's more of a technical
sale, you need to have those micro services available, so that they -- that technical
person can, kind of, buy the piece parts that they need.
On the other hand, if it's more in a line of business sale, which will happen a lot in
IoT, you need to have more of an application go-to-market. And so, we think it's
actually quite useful for a platform vendor to be able to oﬀer both approaches to theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-17

Page 10 of 14Anurag Rana
Stacy Crookmarket. So that's where we see the momentum in this market happening over the
next year or so.
And so, that was all I had today. There I am with my contact information and if
anybody has any questions that don't get answered within our Q&A session today,
feel free to reach out afterwards. That's it.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Thank you so much, Stacy, for such a good overview. Just a request to our listeners, if
you have any questions, please type them out and I will read them out to Stacy. So
Stacy let me just talk about a little bit of something that we have learned from just
cloud, in general, is, when you look at a cloud architecture and cloud, you could say
one of the reasons of going to the cloud was, it was a little more secure or, I would
say, far more secure, it has a homogeneous architecture compared to a combination
of a lot of internal IT patched together over years. But when we look at the IoT space,
we really don't have, as you mentioned, one large mega provider and we are again
going back to that same construct of IT services companies patching together these
relationships, these products, and are we going to come up with, again, business
models that are so ﬂawed with security that would, once these things take oﬀ, it
might actually come down pretty quickly.
{BIO 18685239 <GO>}
So I think that that's a really astute observation. I do think that what we're going to
see happen is that some of the leading cloud providers are going to take the
initiative to move into spaces that -- either that they haven't before or they're going
to create really tight partnerships with other leading technology providers. So I think
one example of this is that we've seen that these cloud providers are moving their
cloud technology actually outside of the cloud, right. So the ﬁrst thing that we've
seen is that they're taking cloud technology and allowing customers to run it on-
premise.
And now, so -- like Azure, if you take Microsoft, for example, Azure stack is a good
example of that. And then with IoT now, they're moving it even further out, so like
we'll just continue with Microsoft. With it, now they have Azure IoT EDGE, which is
kind of taking a bunch of those web services and running it even further out from the
cloud on a smaller IoT endpoint. And then what they introduced most recently with
fear, which is something -- which is an operating system for a microcontroller, which
is like the end of the IoT endpoint usually.
So we do see that the cloud providers are one -- are taking this initiative to create a
more of a -- and part of the reason they're doing this, right, is to create a secure, their
trade net chain of trust from the end -- the way end of the IoT back into the cloud,
but there are going to be other complete pieces of computing in there that say
Microsoft might not do like a gateway. So I think that we'll see these companies, like
we talked about the example of IBM and Cisco, coming together to create a
partnership around IoT. So that's what I think will happen here. It's not that the
services providers won't still play an important role, but I do think that theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-17
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 11 of 14Anurag Rana
Stacy Crook
Anurag Ranatechnology vendors are going to increasingly take this upon themselves to create
this chain of trust within their own solutions to the extent that they can, but then also
form these really close alliances with other major technology providers where it's
needed.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Now, that's fairly a detailed discussion of that. Now, one of the things that we have
also seen as we have been digging around this topic for the last few months is, these
EDGE computing services launched by the cloud providers are fairly new. I mean, I
think -- it's -- all of them are perhaps not more than 2 years old, is it that concept that
is helping the adoption rate, because as you mentioned, I mean, we have been also
hearing from some of the services companies that are implementing these projects
that the project size are improving and enterprise adoption is going up, is that -- that
is the key reason or do you see anything else that's driving this adoption rate?
{BIO 18685239 <GO>}
So I think that that's part of it, right. Because when we think about manufacturing and
the -- that -- the majority of IoT spend is within the manufacturing space. EDGE is
very important for industrial IoT, right. A lot of these organizations, they are just not
going to send, because we talk to them, they are just not going to send that certain
pieces of information are just probably never going to go in the cloud. And so, it is
really important for them to be able to adopt IoT that they know, that they can keep
their information on the factory ﬂoor or whatever that private network is that they
need to keep it within.
So I actually do think that these EDGE computing technologies are going to make it
much more realistic for not only manufacturing but oil and gas too when we think
about the fact that you're having an oilﬁeld in the middle of nowhere, you don't have
that connectivity all the time. So there's diﬀerent challenges they're driving it, but I
think that that's deﬁnitely one part of it.
I think that also digital transformation eﬀorts as those become more mature, IoT
should really sit hand in hand with the digital transformation eﬀort. So as we see that
maturity happening, I think we'll see more of it. I also think as the analytics
technologies mature, that also is really going to help push IoT forward. And one
other really key component of this two is connectivity. So I mean we have cellular
connectivity, but that's expensive. We have -- WiFi is there and that's ﬁne, but when
we talk about somebody's mobile use cases, I think the increasing prevalence of
these LPWAN networks will also help move it forward. So, I think we've got a number
of trends converging at once to help start pushing IoT forward.

Thanks. So there is another one that has been on our mind for a while. So when you
look at some of the vendors that are currently amongst the top list that you have,
General Electric pops up and you have a number of other industrial companies, you
mentioned Siemens and Bosch. Now, they have been -- at least General Electric hasFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-17

Stacy Crookbeen talking about this for many years, but it seems like it doesn't look like that had
that level of traction as I would have expected three years ago and we recently saw
them partner with Microsoft, for example, to do -- use Azure as the back-end for
some of those Predix applications. Now, is this a trend that we should see going
forward as well that industrial companies will use the tech companies as their
backbone and would be more interesting in selling some higher value services? And
will the cloud providers be the ﬁnal winners in that case?
{BIO 18685239 <GO>}
So, I do think that we see this trend happening. So I think GE, as you mentioned, GE
Digital is moving in that direction, Bosch is also moving in that direction, where
they're running various components of their IoT suite on public clouds. We talked to
ABB the other day, who is really highly invested in Azure as the platform for their IoT
solutions. And ICG has done this too, where they are moving more towards an IoT
solution or application focus, and I think what those companies have realized is that
running of the infrastructure for these applications is not their core competency, and
that -- and doing that takes a lot of resource and eﬀort. So I think that what they're
really trying to focus on is what is our core competency and their core competency is
knowing these industries very well and understanding the speciﬁc use cases and the
value they're trying to get out of it, so I think that they are going to focus more on the
analytics and the application layer versus the infrastructure moving forward.

Got it. One of the more interesting use cases I've seen with Salesforce where these
devices can be connected to their CRM system and messages can be sent to
people's mobile devices or to e-mails about things potentially breaking down, so it's
a very interesting concept, because there -- it doesn't look like they are on the device
management side, they are more on the CRM side of it. Any other vendors that are
doing that kind of cooler stuﬀ in that arena? I know you had mentioned Google, but I
wasn't sure if they have something like that too?
{BIO 18685239 <GO>}
So, I think that when you think about what Salesforce is doing, yes, it is on that
adding the context piece of it. So other companies that are sort of competing with
them in the CRM space are going to look to do similar, look to have similar
strategies, right. I think when you think about the way that Oracle, SAP, Microsoft
started to think about IoT, they are thinking about -- even GE, with its ServiceMax
acquisition is thinking about how do we make -- how do we improve customer
service through our ﬁeld service organization, how do we create those personalized
experiences. So if customer is staying in this hotel and we know every time she
comes to this hotel, she likes to, I don't know, order the same meal from room
service. Then I think that that's something that's being looked at.
IBM too is one to watch and in this space with the IBM Assistant that they've recently
launched for IoT, so I think any of these companies too, they're participating in the AI
space, which all those companies have some strategy there, they'll look to see howFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-17

Anurag Ranathey can combine IoT with AI to create better personalization. So seems to be a lot of
interesting things going on.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
I have one ﬁnal question and that's on blockchain. I mean, that's something that's
obviously been in the news a lot for a lot of reasons. What are kind of the use cases
when it comes to IoT? And what kind of, I guess, solution/applications can we see
emerging from that?
{BIO 18685239 <GO>}
So, yeah, I think -- so let me say, I think there is kind of three big places, big
applications that we're looking at right now. We do plan to write some research on
this very, very soon and all sort of detail this all out. But I think anything that has a
track and trace component can be very interesting to use IoT with blockchain. So the
thing and that's moving through the supply chain or the logistics could be
transmitting data and could be transmitting data to a blockchain, so that -- and the
blockchain is verifying that this is true, so that when the product ends up wherever
it's supposed to go. If something goes wrong with that product, so say it's food; if
the food reaches its end destination and it's spoiled, you can ﬁnd out exactly where
in the logistics process this happened, because say when it was on a plane, it was
sending back information which was veriﬁed by the blockchain that the refrigerator
temperature was X, Y, Z at this time. But later in the process, maybe we see that
refrigerator did not -- it was not at the temperature it was supposed to be, and that
was also veriﬁed by blockchain, so we can -- it veriﬁes, it gives us better veriﬁcation
on when something may have gone wrong in that process of getting that food to
someone.
I think another interesting use case for blockchain in IoT is with security. So when we
think about traditional security models, something is authenticating against a
centralized authenticator. And in IoT we might not have the time to make the trip.
Again that authentication service is in the cloud, we might not have time to make
that trip out to the cloud and back. So we can have more of a peer to peer security
model for IoT that could be interesting. Again (technical diﬃculty) that IoT and
blockchain are both more or like these distributed models.
Another interesting use case could be for monetization. So if we can use
cryptocurrency as our way to pay for something within the IoT, so we can think about
blockchain and IoT coming together for IoT monetization use cases. And there are
certain organizations like IOTA is one of those that's really focused on that use case
of bringing IoT and blockchain together. I think, IoT Chain is, maybe, another
organization to look at there.

Awesome. Stacy, thank you so much for such an informed session, and we look
forward to talking to you again next year and get an update on the same strategy.
And that's all from me. Thank you, everyone.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-17
