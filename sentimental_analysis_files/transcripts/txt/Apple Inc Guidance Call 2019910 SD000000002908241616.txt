Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Good morning. Good morning. Welcome to
the Steve Jobs Theater. We've always believed that by giving people wonderful
tools, you enable them to do wonderful things. In Apple, we put the customer at the
center of everything that we do with products and technologies that are designed in
the service of humanity. Innovations that enrich people's lives to help them learn,
create, work, play, share and stay healthy. Through the deep integration of hardware,
software and services, these products empower people to do incredible things every
day.
We have a huge morning planned for you with some truly big announcements. So
I'm going to dispense of my usual updates and get right into it, beginning with the
App Store. We're adding a whole new way to enjoy games on the App Store with
Apple Arcade. We joined forces with the world's most innovative game developers
to push the boundaries of what's possible.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-10

Ann ThaiTo tell you all about Apple Arcade, I'd like to invite Ann to the stage. Ann?
Thanks, Tim. We are thrilled to launch Apple Arcade on the App Store, the world's
ﬁrst game subscription service for mobile, desktop and TV. Apple Arcade is the only
place you can get unlimited access to over 100 groundbreaking, exclusive new
games made for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV. You can't ﬁnd these games on any
other mobile platform or subscription service. No game service has ever launched as
many games at once. And we can't wait for you to play all of them.
Instead of paying upfront for each game, your subscription lets you download and
play any Apple Arcade game right from the App Store. It all starts with the App
Store's brand new Arcade tab, where you can discover the latest Apple Arcade
games with new games added every month, get personalized recommendations,
watch game trailers and get expert editorial content like game guides and sneak
peeks. This collection of awesome games covers so many genres and play styles. So
everyone in the family can count on ﬁnding games they love on Apple Arcade. We
are really excited to show you a few today.
First up are our partners at Konami, who have delighted players for decades. Their
next game is sure to be a hit for the whole family. Please welcome Konami brand
manager, Benjamin Kinney, to tell you more.
{BIO 21966256 <GO>}
Thanks, Ann. Everybody loves Frogger. That's why together with Q-Games, Konami
could not be more excited to bring our title to Apple Arcade, Frogger in Toy Town. In
this level, we ﬁnd ourselves in a bathroom. And Frogger has to rescue some of his
froglet friends. Like classic Frogger, there are many obstacles in the way. But for now,
you can ﬁnd power ups, like this bomb, that you can use to clear a path ahead of
you. You're also, of course, collecting jellybeans. This is a fun and important part of
game play. But I'll tell you more about that here in a little while.
So the physics are incredible. See how the blocks bob up and down in real time
when you jump on them and look, we rescued another froglet friend. You have
dozens of diﬀerent outﬁts that you can put your Frogger in. Today, we have picked
this adorable bathing suit. Isn't he cute? Whoa, what is that? Is that a giant baby
wearing sunglasses? He is making a mess. Let's try to go around him. Remember
those jellybeans from earlier? Well when you collect 100, you unlock Super Frogger.
All right, all right, enough of that. We got the last froglet to rescue. And we did it.
Great job.
Frogger in Toy Town time will be available at launch. And we cannot wait for you to
play with your friends and family exclusively on Apple Arcade. Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-10

Kelsey HansenThanks, Benjamin. Frogger looks adorable. Next up is legendary game studio
Capcom. Their new game brings console-quality graphics and gameplay to a whole
new audience. To tell you more, please welcome Capcom producer, Peter Fabiano.
Thanks, Ann. With Shinsekai: Into the Depths, we set out to create a beautiful yet
treacherous underwater world. The world above is covered in ice. You have no
choice but to search the ocean below. This is humanity's last survivor. You'll notice
gauges at the top that indicate air, health and depth. You'll need to be thoughtful
and careful as you traverse the new world. You can use thrusters to navigate or get to
safety.
While searching for resources, our explorer encounters a terrifying creature, which is
why it's ever important that you maintain your oxygen levels. Lucky for us, our little
drone is here to help us out. We crafted every detail of the world to make it feel
authentic and immersive. In fact, we recorded music and sound eﬀects underwater.
Let's give it a listen.
Shinsekai's controls are simple, yet mastering shooting while thrusting will challenge
even the most seasoned gamer. The underwater physics and the creature's
unpredictable attacks make battle both challenging and a blast. You'll have to ﬁnd
out what happens next by playing Shinsekai: Into the Depths.
We are bringing our brand of game design to a new, wider global audience both at
home and on mobile available only on Apple Arcade. Thank you.
Wow. Thanks, Peter. That was beautiful. Our last demo is from Annapurna Interactive
known for innovative games that break the mold. Their next game is truly one of a
kind.
To tell you more, please welcome, Annapurna Interactive producer, Kelsey Hansen.
Thanks, Ann. We are teaming up with Simogo to bring their creative, ambitious new
game to Apple Arcade. Sayonara Wild Hearts is a fast-paced, neon pop music
dreamscape. We like to think of it as a playable music video. Let's jump in.
You play it as our heartbroken heroine as she races to win back her heart. In this
level, our heroine is chasing after the stereo lovers. You'll seamlessly transition back
and forth between rhythm-based tapping and high-speed racing. You as a player will
never actually move in the camera but playing in perspective automatically change
makes this game challenging and so much fun. The battle and storytelling are
interwoven with the music, making sure you never miss a beat.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-10

Timothy D. CookTo add to the excitement, collecting hearts will increase your rank. The more hearts
you collect, the higher your score will be. Sensing defeat, the twins up the ante and
transform their swords into a giant jet in an attempt to escape. But our heroine has
other ideas. With one slash of her sword, our heroine defeats the stereo lovers. She
reclaims a piece of her heart and steals a piece of ours.
We hope you enjoy Sayonara Wild Hearts on Apple Arcade. Thank you.
Thank you, Kelsey. What an awesome soundtrack. These 3 talented partners joined
so many more amazing developers, bringing new games to Apple Arcade this year.
Apple Arcade is available starting on September 19. And that's in over 150 countries
around the world. We'll be introducing over 100 new games to our launch catalog in
the weeks ahead.
So how much does unlimited access to all these amazing games cost? Just $4.99 a
month for the whole family. And we're launching with a 1-month free trial. We hope
you have a blast playing all the incredible games on Apple Arcade.
Thanks. And back to you, Tim.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
Thank you, Ann. Apple Arcade is a gaming service unlike any other out there. We
can't wait to start playing when it launches later this month.
Next up, let's talk about Apple TV+. Our mission for Apple TV+ is to bring you the
best original stories from the most creative minds in television and ﬁlm, stories that
help you ﬁnd inspiration that are grounded in emotion, truly stories to believe in,
stories with purpose. This summer, we released 3 trailers for a few of our premier
originals like For All Mankind, an innovative reimagination of the space race. And
Dickinson, starring Hailee Steinfeld, a coming-of-age story about Emily Dickinson
told in a completely modern way. And The Morning Show, with this blockbuster cast
starring Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell and Jennifer Aniston in her ﬁrst TV series
since Friends.
The reaction to these trailers has been incredible. They've been viewed over 100
million times. In fact, the trailer for The Morning Show is one of the most watched
trailers for any new television show ever. This is incredible. And the new issue of
Entertainment Weekly calls The Morning Show "fall's most anticipated series."
This morning, I want to share with you one of the most imaginative, thrilling and
thought-provoking dramas ever. See stars Jason Momoa. And it takes place
hundreds of years into the future in a world without sight. We worked with blind andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-10

for how this world should be deﬁned.
Today, I am so excited to share with you the worldwide premier trailer for See.
(presentation)
I hope that you get a sense of why I love that show. And I think that you will, too.
Now these are just a few of the exclusive originals from the exciting Apple TV+
lineup. With Apple TV+, you'll get access to these and so many more, the best
movies, comedies, dramas and kid shows.
Now I know that some of you have been wondering when will Apple TV+ be
available and how much will it cost. Well today, we're excited to tell you that the ﬁrst
shows will be available on November 1. And we'll be adding more Apple originals
every month. And Apple TV+ will be available in over 100 countries at launch. And it
is just $4.99 per month for your whole family. That's all of these incredible shows for
the price of a single movie rental. This is crazy.
We are so excited about Apple TV+ that we wanted to do something really special.
And so starting today, when you buy an iPhone, an iPod, a Mac or an Apple TV, you'll
get one year of Apple TV+ included for free. So we can't wait for you to start
watching Apple TV+ on November 1 in the Apple TV app across all of your screens.
That's Apple TV+.
Now let's turn our attention to iPad. When we created iPad, we set out to design
something truly unique, a product that you could take with you everywhere and that
is so fun and so easy to use. And now with hundreds and hundreds of millions of
iPads out in the world, iPad is transforming the way we create, learn, work and play.
This has been a huge year for iPad. We've revamped our entire lineup starting with
the new iPad mini, all the way up to the powerful iPad Pros. And we pushed what
people could do with iPad further than ever before with the introduction of the iPad
OS.
IPadOS is an advanced operating system with a new name to recognize the
distinctive experience of iPad. Of course, iPadOS builds on the same foundation as
iOS but adds powerful new capabilities and intuitive features that are speciﬁc to the
large display and versatility of the iPad. iPad's unique integration of hardware,
software with over 1 million apps that are speciﬁcally designed to take advantage of
the large canvas, provide an experience that you won't ﬁnd on any other device out
there. We have never been more excited about the future of iPad.
And to tell you about the newest iPad, I'd like to invite Joz to the stage. Joz?

Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 6 of 25Thanks, Tim. Thank you. Thank you. We're incredibly excited about iPadOS and our
entire iPad lineup. But today, I want to talk to you about our most popular iPad. The
9.7-inch delivers so much versatility at such an aﬀordable price. And it brings more
new users to our iPad than any other model.
In fact, for nearly 60% of these users, this is their very ﬁrst iPad. And we're about to
make this iPad a whole lot better because we're replacing the 6th generation iPad
with this, the new 7th generation iPad. This is a big upgrade with some great new
features and it's designed to make the most out of iPadOS.
Of course, iPad is a magical piece of glass and can become almost anything we want
it to be. So the display is so important to the iPad experience. And we're making the
display even bigger. This iPad has a new larger 10.2-inch Retina display. It has nearly
3.5 million pixels. When you compare it to this, the top-selling PC laptop in the U.S.
for the ﬁrst half of this year, I know, I know, this display has more than 3x the number
of pixels, plus greater brightness and a much wider viewing angle so your content
always looks amazing. Under the hood of this iPad is the A10 Fusion chip. So that
means that this iPad is up to 2x faster than that top-selling PC.
And for the very ﬁrst time, our new most popular iPad features the smart connector
so you can eﬀortlessly connect the optional full-sized Smart Keyboard, which delivers
a great typing experience and a thinner, light design that also folds into a protective
cover. And we're especially excited that this iPad was engineered to take full
advantage of iPadOS.
iPadOS is packed with an enormous breadth of new features designed for iPad's
unique capabilities, including the redesigned home screen, powerful new ways to
work with multiple apps, deeper integration with Apple Pencil, desktop-class
browsing with Safari and so much more. iPadOS truly expands what you can do with
this iPad. So let's take it for a quick spin.
First, let's talk about multitasking. With iPadOS, it's never been easier to get to your
favorite apps. You can quickly switch between multiple apps and slide over or fan
them out to pick the one you want, or you can swipe along the bottom to get in
between multiple spaces. You can even use the same app like Notes across multiple
spaces and pair with diﬀerent apps. It's perfect for working on multiple projects.
Safari brings desktop-class browsing to iPad. So now you can create a website in
Squarespace or edit your documents at Google Docs right in Safari. And with a
simple pinch on the soft keyboard, a new ﬂoating keyboard appears, gives you more
room for your content and a great one-handed typing experience is awesome.
iPadOS enables new workﬂows on iPad. So now you can even connect your SD card
or your thumb drive to quickly browse your photos and videos right in the ﬁles app.
And you have a whole new video editing experience with powerful new tools in the
new enhanced Photos app. You can add ﬁlters and eﬀects. You can even crop and
rotate your video.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-10

Page 7 of 25Timothy D. CookAnd there's some great new ways to use Apple Pencil. Simply swipe up from the
bottom corner to capture a screenshot or choose the new full-page option to create
a PDF of a full webpage or your document. And from there, you can mark it up with
your notes and share it, all without ever putting the pencil down.
And there's so much more to iPad, including our awesome new services. I mean
gaming on the iPad was already awesome. But now it's even better because of
Apple Arcade. You can't get anything like this on any other device or just lean back
and enjoy all that amazing Apple TV+ content. And as Tim just told you, you seem to
like it, you even get one year of Apple TV+ included for free.
We think the combination of iPadOS, our new service oﬀerings, this new iPad
hardware is simply incredible. So this is the new 7th generation iPad, 10.2-inch Retina
display, support for Apple Pencil and a full-sized Smart Keyboard and as you would
expect, great cameras, sensors and ultrafast wireless, all packed into a thin and light
design that's durable and weighs about 1 pound. And for the very ﬁrst time, our
enclosure is made from 100% recycled aluminum. We're really proud that we can
continue to expand our environmental achievements for this, our most popular iPad.
We're also proud that with all these enhancements, this new iPad will start at just
$329. And when you think about all the things this iPad can do, we can't think of
another device that delivers this much value. And for our education customers, it's
even more aﬀordable at $299. And you can -- well, there you go. You can order it
today. And it will start shipping at the end of the month.
It really has been a big year for iPad. This new iPad joins the new iPad mini, iPad Air
and iPad Pros, all taken further than ever before with iPadOS.
So that's the news for iPad. Now back to Tim.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
Thanks, Joz. This new iPad will enable so many more people to experience the
power and versatility of iPad.
Now next up, let's talk about Apple Watch. Apple Watch puts groundbreaking
health, ﬁtness and communications capabilities onto the wrist of millions and
millions of people. Today, Apple Watch is everywhere. And it's making a diﬀerence in
so many ways all over the world. We hear ﬁrsthand every day about the truly
personal and profound impacts that the Apple Watch is having on people's lives. So
we made a video for you this morning to share just some of these stories with you.
(presentation)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's truly inspiring to see the diﬀerence that the
Apple Watch is making. And me hearing these stories really make my heart sing. And
these are just a few of the amazing stories that I get every day.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-10

important area that aﬀects all of us. And that is health research. We're excited about
how Apple Watch can make a tremendous diﬀerence in this area.
And to tell you more about it, I'd like to invite Sumbul to the stage. Sumbul?
{BIO 22291272 <GO>}
Thanks, Tim. What makes the amazing stories you just saw even possible are the
incredible capabilities built into Apple Watch, each one requiring sense of
development and research. This deep focus on science is the foundation of many of
our product features, especially the ones focused on health.
For example, the irregular heart rhythm notiﬁcation was developed using the data
from the largest study ever focused on atrial ﬁbrillation. Over 400,000 people
participated in the Apple Heart Study. And this showed, for the ﬁrst time, that a
smartwatch could help in the early detection of AFib. It transformed how we look at
cardiovascular science.
We were so encouraged that today, we are announcing 3 new health research
studies, starting with the Apple Hearing Study. Since Apple Watch is on you all the
time and can now measure sound levels in your environment, this study will analyze
how your daily sound exposure impacts your long-term hearing health. For this
study, we're working with the experts at the University of Michigan and the World
Health Organization.
For our second study, we're using the new cycle tracking feature that we introduced
in June. The Apple Women's Health Study focuses on an area that hasn't received
much attention in many years. It'll look at how menstrual cycles can inform the
screening for important conditions like infertility and osteoporosis. For this novel
study, we're partnering with the Harvard School of Public Health and the NIH.
Finally, the Apple Heart and Movement Study will look at how metrics from Apple
Watch can serve as early warning signs and help create innovative interventions to
improve overall health. For this study, we're so excited to be partnering with the
American Heart Association and the cardiovascular experts at the Brigham and
Women's Hospital.
If you would like to participate in this research and make a contribution to potential
medical discoveries, you can enroll using the new Apple Research app, where you
can enroll, perform tasks and view your data. Of course, you decide what data you
want to share and with whom. Apple cannot access any information that directly
identiﬁes you. The new Apple Research app will be available in the U.S. later this
year.
Now back to Tim.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-10

Thank you, Sumbul. We're really excited about the impact the Research app can
have. It gives us, all of us, an amazing opportunity to participate in health research
that could lead to innovations to improve our health and the health of future
generations. So I hope that you check it out.
Since the beginning, innovation has been the core of the Apple Watch, innovations
that really matter to people. From the life-changing to the potentially life savings,
many of these technologies were barely imaginable just a few years ago. Apple
Watch has become the most advanced and most loved smartwatch in the world.
And to tell you all about what's next with the Apple Watch, I'd like to invite up Stan
Ng. Stan?
{BIO 22686675 <GO>}
Thanks, Tim. We want to make Apple Watch even better for all the things you do and
places you go. And so today, I'm so excited to share with you the next generation of
Apple Watch.
(presentation)
Introducing Apple Watch Series 5, featuring an innovative new display that is always
on. The new always-on Retina display never sleeps. So the watch face is always
visible. With previous models of Apple Watch, when you lowered your wrist, the
display would go completely dark. But now with Series 5, you'll always be able to see
your time and complications. A wrist raise or a tap brings everything back to full
brightness.
Now the new always-on display is just loaded with advanced technologies. So I want
to tell you about it. It all starts with the industry's only low-temperature polysilicon
and oxide display or LTPO. LTPO allows the display to refresh dynamically from as
high as 60 hertz to as low as 1 hertz, which is extremely power eﬃcient.
There's also a new low power display driver, an ultra-eﬃcient power management
integrated circuit and a new ambient light sensor, which all work seamlessly
together. By combining this incredible hardware with innovative software, we're able
to deliver this always-on display while still maintaining the same all-day 18-hour
battery life.
Now all of the watch faces have been carefully tuned for the new display. So you'll
always be able to see your time and your complications. We've also optimized the
screens for all of the workouts in the Workout apps so you'll able to see your
workout metrics without raising your wrist.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-10
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 10 of 25This always-on display is perfect for those times when you can't raise your wrist or
tap the display or when you're in a social or work setting where you kind of want to
just sneak a quick glance at the time, right, or when in you're in the middle of a crazy
hard workout where a wrist raise just isn't possible. The new always-on display is
going to be useful for so many diﬀerent situations throughout the day. We can't wait
for you to try it.
Next, let's talk about another new feature in Series 5, a built-in compass. Now with
the updated Maps app, you will be able to see which way you're facing just like on
your iPhone. You can add the compass to your watch face so you can see your
direction at a glance. And there's even a new Compass app, which allows you to see
not only your heading but also your latitude, longitude, current elevation and incline.
Now our developers can take advantage of the Compass as well. So the direction is
always clear when you're hiking with Wikiloc, paddle boarding with GOSat or
searching out the constellations with Night Sky.
Next, let's talk about safety features. Apple Watch has some important safety features
built right in, like fall detection, emergency SOS, medical ID. Now emergency SOS
could be lifesaving should you ever need it. And so we wanted to make it even more
capable. Now with Series 5, every cellular model has international emergency
calling. So you can call emergency services in over 150 countries around the world
just by pressing and holding down the side button even without your iPhone. We
think this will give you great peace of mind if you ever travel internationally.
Next, another important beneﬁt of Apple Watch is being able to express your
personal style. And Series 5 has the widest assortment of case ﬁnishes ever.
Aluminum models come in silver, gold and space gray. And now the cases are made
from 100% recycled aluminum. Stainless steel models come in gold, space black and
polished. And we're introducing new models for the ﬁrst time in titanium. This
natural-brushed titanium maintains its color through a special surface treatment that
Apple custom engineered. And there's also a second model in titanium in this
brushed space black with a diamond-like coating. Series 5 will be available in
ceramic as well in this brilliant white color. Thank you. It's really beautiful.
There are new Apple Watch Nike models, featuring new Nike Sport bands, new
reﬂective Sport Loops and cool new Nike watch faces. And there are new Hermès
models in these beautiful color block bands with the classic Hermès print. Aren't
they cool? This year, we're also introducing Hermès models in black, featuring space
black stainless steel cases featuring handcrafted leather bands. These are just
stunning. Of course, every Apple Watch is designed and manufactured in the most
environmentally friendly way possible.
We're so excited about Apple Watch Series 5 with its always-on display, Compass,
international emergency calling and all the other great features like its swimproof,
you can take an ECG, fall detection, Apple Pay, all the new features of WatchOS 6. It
truly is the most capable Apple Watch ever.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-10

Thank you, Stan. I'm really excited about this new Apple Watch lineup. And with all of
the new amazing features, Apple Watch is going to enable you to do even more than
before. We created a fun video to demonstrate just this. And I'd love to play it for you
now.
(presentation)
I love that video. I love that video. It really helps you understand so many of the
amazing things that the watch can do.
Next up, let's talk about iPhone. iPhone and the incredible capabilities that it puts
into people's hands has changed the way we live our lives in ways that we never
could have imagined. It's become so essential for hundreds and hundreds of
millions of people all over the world. It's changed industries and led to the creation
of entirely new ones. And it's made a profound impact on all of our daily lives.
Customers love iPhone. And we keep striving to make it better and better. Last year,
we launched 3 incredible iPhones. The iPhone XR became the most popular iPhone
and the most popular smartphone in the world. We also launched the iPhone XS and
the XS Max, the most advanced iPhones we have ever created. These 3 iPhones
together have a combined 99% customer satisfaction. This is the highest in the
industry, really unbelievable. Customers love the iPhone because we focus on
technologies that matter most in their lives.
Today, I am thrilled to share with you the newest iPhone.
(presentation)
This is iPhone 11, the next generation of iPhone. And it is jam-packed with great new
capabilities in an incredible new design. To tell you all about iPhone 11, I'd like to
invite Kaiann to the stage. Kaiann?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-10
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 12 of 25Thank you, Tim. The innovations in iPhone 11 are truly remarkable. And that starts with
the design. IPhone 11 has a beautiful anodized aluminum and glass design. And that
glass, it's the toughest ever in a smartphone on the front and back. And the glass
that surrounds the camera has a sculpted 3D geometry. And it was precision-milled
down from a single piece of glass to achieve this elegant look.
iPhone 11 comes in 6 new colors with an all-new purple, white, yellow, green, black
and product red. It has a 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display with true tone, wide color, tap
to wake and Haptic touch in even more places with iOS 13 like contextual menus.
Our videos are wonderful to watch on this display. And now we have spatial audio,
which provides an immersive theater-like experience by creating a sound ﬁeld
around you using an Apple-designed virtualizer. And we support Dolby Atmos for an
incredible sound experience.
Now let's talk about camera. iPhone is the world's most popular camera. And it gets
even better with iPhone 11. We have an amazing dual camera system with an all-new
wide camera with a new sensor with 100% focus pixels for faster autofocus, 3x faster
in low light. And we have a new ultrawide camera with 120-degree ﬁeld of view. This
will let you capture way more in your photos and videos.
Because now you can take a wide camera shot like this. But switch to the ultrawide to
reveal the scale, yes, you can now see the beautiful framing by mother nature. But
the details still are there in the sky, the rocks and the sand. This is doing an optical
zoom out 2x. So you can capture way more without moving.
So now when you're taking a wide camera shot, you'll see our new immersive
camera interface that lets you see outside the frame, hinting at a bigger shot. Then
you can simply tap to switch to the ultrawide, revealing more of your scene. This is
great for these epic landscape shots where you can see edge to edge all this detail.
And it's also great for tight spaces, where you can't physically backup. But the
ultrawide lets you do that, revealing more of your story.
You can use an angle like this to take a heroic and dynamic shot because the
ultrawide can elongate your subject yet keep all these details sharp from her red
dress all the way to her face. Now these are some examples of great ultrawide
photos.
We've also updated our image pipeline, which processes over 1 trillion operations
per photo. And it's got our image signal processor and it has our Neural Engine for
machine learning. And now we've added semantic rendering. This allows us to more
intelligently detect subjects and relight them with detail so they look even better.
Now we use this across your photos, including in our next-gen smart HDR. You can

Page 13 of 25Now it works here in portrait mode. And people love taking portraits on iPhone 11.
And iPhone 11 has this wide angle camera. So you can take these beautiful wide
shots of portraits for people. But now with 2 cameras, we have stereoscopic depth.
So now you can also take portraits of your favorite pets. And you can also use
creative depth-of-ﬁeld for shots like this.
Now we have a new portrait lighting eﬀect. And that's High-Key Mono. You can take
a stunning studio quality portrait like this from a pretty ordinary background. All
right. Let's talk about night mode. This is for those very low light environments like
outdoors at night or inside a dimly lit restaurant. And night mode comes on
automatically when it's dark enough to brighten photos and reduce noise. Here is an
image with night mode turned oﬀ. Here it is with night mode turned on. We
determine the image fusion time and use adaptive bracketing based on what we see
in preview. So shorter frames if you have subject motion or longer frames if you have
deep shadows to recover them. Then we intelligently fuse images together reducing
motion and blur.
All right. We know you love taking videos. And you're capturing more than ever on
iPhone. So I'm really excited to show you the ﬁrst video shot on iPhone 11 entirely on
our wide and ultrawide cameras.
(presentation)
So the quality is just astounding. That was shot in 4K resolution. And all the shots,
including the ones overhead, were handheld. So it's making use of our even better
cinematic video stabilization.
So in taking video, you can easily tap to switch to the ultrawide camera to capture
even more in your scene. You could also use the zoom wheel to just transition easily
between the 2 cameras.
Now we make it great to capture in all the formats you love because we support 4K
resolution up to 60 frames per second, slowmo, time-lapse, cinematic video
stabilization and now extended dynamic range at 4K up to 60 frames per second.
And this is across both cameras, which is pretty cool.
We also wanted to make it easier for you to take a quick video with QuickTake. So
now when you're taking photos and you decide you want to take a quick video,
simply tap and hold the shutter button to record a video. You can do that without
changing frames. So video really shines on iPhone 11. In fact, it has the highest quality
video ever in a smartphone. This is enabled by our real-time processing across our
camera hardware, our software, our video encoders and our chip. So that's the
amazing dual camera system on iPhone 11 with the new wide and ultrawide for 2x
optical zoom out, night mode, a brighter ﬂash, next-gen smart HDR and the highest
quality video. It will change the way you take your photos and videos.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-10

Page 14 of 25Yang YangWe've also updated our front TrueDepth camera to a wider 12-megapixel sensor. So
now you can still take your 7 megapixel selﬁes as you normally would. But simply
rotate to landscape to capture even more people using that wider sensor.
Also on the front camera, we've added 4k video with extended dynamic range up to
30 frames per second. And you can also capture on the front at 4k 60 as well. Now
we've also added slow-motion video to the front camera for the ﬁrst time. Now we
think this is going to be really fun. So fun that we created a little ad about it and we
couldn't resist showing you.
(presentation)
Okay. So we want this to inspire you to go take some awesome sloﬁes because we
can't wait to see them. All right. Now so much of our great camera is also enabled by
performance. And iPhone 11 has leading performance for your everyday to the most
demanding tasks. In fact, our Apple design chips have led the industry for many
years. Ben says the A12 is so far ahead of the industry that it will still be competitive
with the best Android smartphones in two years.
We're now introducing the A13 Bionic, the next generation of our industry-leading
chip. So if you look at CPU performance with the iPhone XR's A12 Bionic chip, it still
leads the pack in terms of the latest smartphones and chips. Well the A13 Bionic is
just going to extend that lead even further. The A13 is the fastest CPU ever in a
smartphone. And that's great because everything you do, every day from morning
until night, makes use of the chip.
So what about graphics? Well if you look at the A12, still leading the pack in GPU
performance. And the A13 Bionic is just going to get even faster because the A13
Bionic is also the fastest GPU ever in a smartphone.
And to show you more about that because this is great for mobile gaming, I'd like to
introduce Giant Network. They are the force behind some of the most popular
mobile games in China. And now with their studio, TipsWorks, they're preparing to
release their ﬁrst global title. It's called Pascal's Wager. And I'd like to introduce Yang
Yang, the founder of TipsWorks.

Now we've changed to Benita, whose powerful whip can take on enemies midrange.
We spent hours recreating the perfect sounds of footsteps, chains and even blades
clashing. Details are clear with the iPhone spatial audio. Let's watch as Benita ﬁght

this with an incredible 60 frames per second of smooth performance, which comes
in handy as we keep the evil at bay. Speaking of evil, our hero could use some help.
We don't want to spoil anything. This is a preview of Pascal's Wager. Preorder
exclusively on the App Store next month. Thank you.
So I just have to say how remarkable it is that a game like that with those kinds of
phenomenal graphics can run on a small and powerful chip in the palm of your hand
with A13 Bionic. So just kudos to that and our incredible silicon engineers. We can't
wait to see Pascal's Wager and what else other developers will come up with, with
the A13.
All right. So battery. We know that battery life is really important to customers. And
last year, with the iPhone XR, we already had the longest battery life in an iPhone
ever. And it was a big leap and our customers loved it. So with the advancements in
iPhone 11, it'll still have an hour more in battery than in your iPhone XR for incredible
battery life.
The advances in iPhone 11 really touch areas that customers experience every day.
This is innovation that matters, powerful, dual camera system, night mode and things
we didn't even have time to talk about like faster Face ID, water and dust resistance,
wireless charging, WiFi 6 and more. We think customers will love iPhone 11. And
we've created a really fun video all about it.

am thrilled to introduce it to you now.
(presentation)
Thank you. Yes. This is the iPhone 11 Pro. And these are the most powerful and most
advanced iPhones that we have ever built in a stunning new design.
I'd like to invite Phil up to tell you all about them. Phil?
{BIO 1921735 <GO>}
Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone. How are you doing out there? This is the
ﬁrst phone that we've called Pro. And for us, that means it's a device that pros can
count on to get their work done. But it's also a product for all of us who want simply
the best product made even if we're not a pro.
So let's talk all about it. We'll start with this incredible stunning new pro design. This
is the most advanced and detailed iPhone we've made yet. It's made of a surgical-
grade stainless steel. That back is a single piece of machine glass with an optical
PVD coating. There's a beautiful new matte textured ﬁnish that looks great and feels
awesome in your hand.
iPhone 11 Pro has its own gorgeous new ﬁnishes. This is an all-new midnight green.
There's a very pro space gray, a beautiful silver and a new gold. These are incredible.
All right. Let's talk about this pro display. It comes in 2 sizes, 5.8 inches and 6.5
inches. They have the highest pixel density of any display Apple makes.
Our Super Retina display is the most advanced we've ever built into an iPhone. It's a
new OLED panel that has 2 million to 1 contrast ratio. P3 wide color, true tone, Haptic
touch and now a much brighter up to 1,200 nits. That's incredibly bright while also
be 15% more energy eﬃcient. Now this incredible new display has a level of
brightness, contrast ratio, color and detail. But really, it's the experience that we're
building into the new display for the Mac Pro, we call that the Pro Display XDR. And
now that experience is being built into an iPhone.
In addition to that, it has the spatial audio sound that Kaiann told you about. It has
HDR10, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos. So we decided it's worthy of a new name. We call
it the Super Retina HDR display.
All right. Let's talk about performance, a pro level performance. As you know, our A
series chips have kept Apple ahead of the industry for years now. And the A13 Bionic
is going to extend that lead.
So to tell you even more about the A13 Bionic, I'm really excited to bring up Sri

Thank you, Phil. Hello, everyone. Our engineering team at Apple has been designing
chips for iPhone for over a decade. And today, I'm excited to talk to you about A13
Bionic, our latest creation. And we have touched everything.
Now at Apple, we have the beneﬁt of owning the entire vertical stack, the software,
the system hardware and the chip design. And we work together to optimize every
block on the chip, all the way from the transistor up through the package design to
work eﬃciently for iOS and iPhone. We've touched so many things and improved so
many things in the A13 Bionic. But today, I'd like to talk to you about 2 speciﬁc
improvements, machine learning and low-power design.
First, machine learning. We use machine learning all throughout iPhone. And in our
chips, our CPU, GPU and Neural Engine are all optimized for diﬀerent types of
machine learning workloads. And in A13 Bionic, we made them all faster for ML,
particularly the CPU.
We added brand new machine learning accelerators in our CPUs. These accelerators
are built to run matrix multiplication very fast. That's an operation that's used
frequently in ML computation. These dedicated accelerators allow the CPU to
process matrix mapped operations up to 6x faster, making the CPU capable of over 1
trillion operations per second.
Now as developers experiment in the bleeding edge of ML, the CPU can accelerate
these nascent evolving models. In addition, the chip works on our latest generation
of the Apple design machine learning controller so that ML models can be
automatically and seamlessly scheduled on the CPU, GPU and Neural Engine,
balancing eﬃciency and performance.
Together with iPhone 11 Pro, this creates a fully integrated platform where developers
can do some incredible things like natural language processing, image classiﬁcation
in photos and videos and character animation and people inclusion in AR apps. All
of this makes iPhone 11 Pro the best machine learning platform in any smartphone.
The second thing I'd like to talk to you today about is how we lowered the power of
the A13 Bionic. It is our most eﬃcient chip to date. And here are a few reasons why.
First, it starts with the transistors, the fundamental building blocks of our chips. An
A13 Bionic uses an advanced, improved second-generation 7-nanometer transistor,
the most advanced in the industry. And we carefully tailored each transistor for high
performance and low-power. And we did this with over 8.5 billion transistors. That's
the most we've ever put into any iPhone chip.
But it's not just the sheer volume of transistors. To get both high performance and
low-power, you need great architecture. One example of that is our Apple
architected high-eﬃciency CPU cores. These cores are the most eﬃcient place to runFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-10
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 18 of 25Philip W. Schillerlightweight tasks and powerful enough to use most of the time, giving you great
battery life.
Finally, at the design level, we applied many, many low-power design techniques to
increase the eﬃciency of our design. For example, we have hundreds of voltage
domains in the chip. So we light up only the sections of the chip that need to
function at any given time. But that's not all. We have hundreds of thousands of clock
gating domains. So we only turn on the smallest amount of logic in the chip,
dramatically reducing power. The result is our highest performing, most eﬃcient
design ever. All of our cores, CPU, GPU and Neural Engine are all up to 20% faster.
In addition, at the same time as we move performance up for those applications and
tasks that don't need more performance than the A12, we were able to reduce the
power of all our engines, for example, our GPU by up to 40%. All of this translates to
great performance and battery life for our customers. And in addition, combined
with the thermal design of the iPhone 11 Pro, we have our best sustained
performance ever.
And that's A13 Bionic. It is our most eﬃcient, most performing chip we have ever
built for iPhone. We can't wait for our customers and developers to see it in action.
Thank you. And back to Phil.
{BIO 1921735 <GO>}
Well thank you, Sri. So what has our team done to help the battery keep up with this
incredible level of pro performance? We are so excited to tell you that with iPhone 11
Pro, you now get up to 4 hours longer in your day; and with iPhone 11 Pro Max, up to
5 hours longer to your day.
We're also including our fast charge 18-watt adapter in the box so you can the
charge them all faster, too.
So I know what you're waiting for. I am, too. Let's talk about the cameras. No
question, my favorite part about iPhone. This is the ﬁrst iPhone that we've had, a
camera system that we call Pro. And it's really worthy of his name.
So what does it have? First, it has a new wide camera. It has a fast F1.8 aperture and
focus pixels that cover 100% of the sensor. There's a new telephoto camera with a
larger F2.0 aperture. It lets in 40% more light and has a new ultrawide camera with a
super wide 120 degree ﬁeld of view and a tremendous range of focus across the
entire image. Now all these work together with the A13 Bionic chip and its new
generation Image Signal Processor. And that enables a whole new level of
photography, pro photography. And you're just going to love it.
So let's go to some of the things it does. First, with the telephoto camera and the
ultrawide, you have the ability to zoom in 2x and zoom out 2x. That's a 4x opticalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-10
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 19 of 25zoom range. With these 3 cameras, you have incredible creative control. So for
example, you can use the telephoto and get in close on your subject to really zoom
in on it, or you can use the wide to tell a bit more of a story. Or you can pull all the
way out to the ultrawide and reveal the full surroundings. And you can take all 3
shots from 1 vantage point.
Now we've given iPhone 11 Pro to some pro photographers to use to see what they
can do with this incredible new camera system. And ﬁrst, they absolutely love it. And
they are excited to share with you some of the photos they've taken. So we've picked
from all the incredible shots they've taken, 6 -- we're going to go through 6 shots
that pros have taken to show you some of the diﬀerent cameras and what's possible.
And they're just stunning. And here's a perfect one to start with. Look at this image. It
is shot with the wide camera, shot by Geordie Wood, shot in a perfect name place
for this photo, Peekaboo Canyon in Kanab, Utah. That's just an awesome name for
this. Look at the eye, the detail of the eye, the details in the eyelashes, the incredible
skin tones. This is a great photo to show the power of this new camera system.
Here's another shot, very diﬀerent kind of shot, also taken with that wide camera.
This was shot by Jake Michaels in L.A. You can see he caught a moment frozen in
time. The fast shutter speed can capture the light just bouncing oﬀ those frozen
water droplets. And it uses our black-and-white pro level image ﬁlter, which gives
incredible tonal grayscale to it.
Now, let's switch over to telephoto. This is an incredible shot taken by Francesca
Allen out in Malibu. Just the incredible image clarity, stunning environment, skin
tones are beautiful, shot by natural light. And that's just the natural depth of ﬁeld of
that aperture with F1.8 -- F2.0. It is amazing. And the blues of the sky and the water,
just stunning.
So now let's look at a portrait mode shot of the telephoto camera. This is very
diﬀerent than what you would take. This is backlit, a backlit portrait mode telephoto
shot by Jake Michaels. And you just see the incredible silhouette. But so much detail
in the hair. Look at the blue and gold backlit. Just so -- such vibrant colors, a stunning
image.
Right. Now let's look at a photo taken with our new ultrawide camera. Jake Michaels
took this down in Venice Beach over a skateboard park. How do you take this? He
got up on a cherry picker, 50 feet above the ground. I think many of us would be a
little nervous doing that. But for us, he did it. Took a shot down with the wide-angle --
with the super wide camera. Just see this incredible abstract image. Looks stunning.
The focus is incredible because of the depth of focus of that camera.
All right. One more example. This is shot with the ultrawide by Chiara Zonca, shot
this in the Arizona. See this amazing contrast between the lights and the darks and
the midtones, the sky, the landscape is just surreal. This is just this otherworldly kind
of shot that we'd all love to get.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-10
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 20 of 25So those are 6 examples of photos using the 3 cameras, what pros could do if you
put it in their hands with their incredible talent. It's amazing stuﬀ.
But now what we want to do, yes, now we want to give you a sneak peek of a new
feature coming in the camera that will be available with the software update this fall.
But it's so cool we had to tell you about it. It's using the Neural Engine of the A13
Bionic to create a whole brand new kind of image processing system. We call it
Deep Fusion. And this is so cool.
So to tell you what it's doing, I'm going to do that while we look at an image. So this
is a photo that was shot on an iPhone 11 Pro using this Deep Fusion technology. And
this kind of an image would not have been possible before. We used machine
learning to take this photo in low to medium light. And it's unlike anything possible
with an iPhone camera before.
So what is it doing? How do we get an image like this? Right, you ready for this?
What it does, it shoots 9 images. Before you press the shutter button, it's already
shot 4 short images, 4 secondary images. When you press the shutter button, it takes
1 long exposure and then in just 1 second, the Neural Engine analyzes the fused
combination of long and short images, picking the best among them, selecting all
the pixels and pixel by pixel, it's going through 24 million pixels to optimize for detail
and low noise like you see in the sweater there. It is amazing. This is the ﬁrst time a
Neural Engine is responsible for generating the output image. It is computational
photography mad science. It is way cool.
All right. Now let's talk about video. iPhone 11 Pro is a powerful new video camera
system. All 3 cameras shoot 4K 60 frame a second, extended dynamic range video
with beautiful highlights and shadow details. So of course, we gave iPhone 11 Pro to a
professional cinematographer and director and asked them to take it to a backlot in
L.A, shoot something and show us all what's possible with this brand-new camera
system. And that's what we want to show you now.
(presentation)
Isn't that incredible? That was not only shot. But also edited entirely on iPhone 11 Pro
by Director of Photography, Guillermo Garza and Director Diego Contreras. Thank
you, guys. That is just stunning video.
And the team works hard to make sure that you can get consistent image capture
across all 3 video cameras. We actually pair the 3 cameras right at the factory,
calibrating them for color and exposure. Then all the time, while you're using them,
we actually do some smart things like we in real time, take data from the camera
you're shooting with and prime the other cameras automatically for autofocus, auto
exposure, color temperature, even tone mapping. So you can get a smooth
transition across all 3 cameras while we minimize any shifts in color or exposure.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-10

new advanced video editing features built into the Photos app. So you can do things
like edit a video for exposure, color temperature, even cropping and scaling right in
the palm of your hands.
So this is the new camera system in iPhone 11 Pro. We think pros are going to love it.
We're all going to love it. It is incredible, new wide, ultrawide, telephoto cameras,
our highest quality video ever, 4x optical zoom, new smarter HDR, new night mode,
on and on, it is incredible. We even have redesigned the camera app. There's a new
font in it called SF camera. It is so pro. You're going to love using it.
Now on top of all of this, iPhone 11 Pro is really the only pro camera with a native app
ecosystem. There's -- App Store has over 50 -- excuse me, over 30,000 photo and
video apps. So you can do just about anything you can imagine right on device.
So a great example of this is FiLMiC. They make a great app called FiLMiC Pro that
makes it possible for award-winning directors to push the boundaries of what's
possible with cinematic ﬁlmmaking on iPhone. So we're really honored to invite up
their CTO, Christopher Cohen. And along with him, Director of acclaimed ﬁlms, The
Florida Project and Tangerine, the ﬁrst theatrical trailer shot entirely on iPhone, Sean
Baker. Welcome, guys.
{BIO 17735608 <GO>}
Thank you, Phil. I shot Tangerine on iPhone using FiLMiC Pro. And I've been working
closely with Chris and the FiLMiC team every sense. Now every shot has the right
lens. As a ﬁlmmaker, it's my job to ﬁgure out which lens that is. On set, I use a tool
called the director's viewﬁnder. It helps me ﬁnd a frame and choose focal length.
Filmmakers have been doing it like this for nearly 75 years.
{BIO 19472878 <GO>}
But what if you could use what we're all going to have in our pockets? We're
delighted to preview the next version of FiLMiC Pro. It's going to move ﬁlmmaking
forward.
Let's take a look at the next generation of lens selection. We've divided the
viewﬁnder into individual feeds, visualizing every ﬁeld of view available on the new
iPhone. With the new A13 and the higher sustained performance of the new iPhone,
you can shoot with our most complex capture pipeline up to 5x longer than before.
But now you can shoot with multiple cameras at the same time, giving ﬁlmmakers
even more options.
{BIO 17735608 <GO>}
And I love that because it's totally transformative. With 2 cameras rolling in FiLMiC
Pro, I get twice as much coverage on the same take, reducing my number of takes
and giving me more options in post.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-10

You just saw all of this great news about our new iPhones. And now you can use your
current iPhone as credit towards a new iPhone. And because we know many of our
customers prefer to pay by month, we're pleased to oﬀer low monthly payments in a
number of our countries. Apple Trade In makes your new iPhone even more
aﬀordable. And because we reuse and recycle, it's great for the planet.
Now those were just 2 of the services that we oﬀer. There is so much more. So much
and the entire store experience is brought to life by our amazing teams and the care
that they have for our customers. This deep care, along with our incredible collection
of products, services and experiences like Today at Apple, are designed to delight
and are available only at Apple.
Now ﬁnally, our stores are the best place for a celebration. So on September 20, the
same day our new iPhones and Apple Watches arrive, we're thrilled to be hosting
our biggest store reopening ever, Apple Fifth Avenue. The newly expanded public
plaza is going to be a wonderful place for the community to gather. And inside,
everything's been completely transformed. We've dramatically increased the height
and we've nearly doubled the size, making it our largest in the world. Apple Fifth
Avenue has a special place in our hearts. And we can't wait to welcome you back.
That's a quick update on retail. Back to you, Tim.
