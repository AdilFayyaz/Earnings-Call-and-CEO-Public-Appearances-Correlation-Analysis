{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Excellent. Thank you everyone for joining us. My name is Keith Weiss, I run the US
Software Research Group here at Morgan Stanley, and very pleased to have with us
this morning Amy Hood from -- CFO from Microsoft. So, Amy, thank you for joining
us.
Before we dig in, I do have to read a brief disclosure. For important disclosures,
please see the Morgan Stanley website at
www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures. So Amy thank you so much for joining
us.
Always an interesting conversation with Microsoft between the commercial side of
the equation, the consumer side of the equation. You cover such a broad swamp of
what's going on in software and technology. I want to dig in on the macro side of the
equation, ﬁrst. And it'll take in two parts. Absent sort of the Ukraine-Russian conﬂict,
what was the Microsoft you heading into 2022 in terms of the overall spending
environment, particularly on the commercial side of the equation?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I think it's not dissimilar to what we shared really in January, which in some ways very
consistent with how we talked about the demand environment for the past couple of
years. The reality that customers around the world have of modernizing business
process at a fundamental level to enable growth and to enable competitiveness,
have been underlying demand, I think on a consistent basis.
Those pressures to modernize and be competitive maybe come from diﬀerent
places, depending on what industry you're in or where you are around the world. But
the process that we have -- I think, sort of, call digital transformation for a lack of a
better term for it, I think sits at the bottom of the demand curve, and we feel good
about the signals, the conversations with customers remain very consistent on thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

Q - Keith Weissfront. Maybe taking on diﬀerent levels of urgency depending on what industry you're
in, where you feel like you are in that competitiveness curve.
And competitiveness is deﬁned, I think oftentimes we say and use and think about
cost or cost per or how does you do something more eﬃciently, eﬀectively. I think it's
also about growing faster. What new markets can you be in. Can you quick up, Can
you patient or quick in the pace of innovation, can you launch new products faster.
Can you do simulations faster. Like, what is the goal.
And so I think that probably sits maybe on a consistent way for me and for the
company. You always have ebbs and ﬂows from other things that impact demand,
but I think overall, it feels pretty consistent.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. So right now there is a big other thing hanging over us, Ukraine-Russian
conﬂict. Can you ﬁrst talk about the immediate Microsoft response? You guys put out
a press release about operations in Russia and Ukraine. What does it actually that
you disclose and any kind of sort of sizing of the impact that you could talk to us
about what that would mean in terms of how much of Microsoft's businesses in
Ukraine and Russia?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Sure. Maybe we should start with the most important thing which is, the war in the
Ukraine and the unjust and unjustiﬁable and illegal envision is the most important
point that we released in our statement. We've been entirely focused on a couple of
things. Number one is life safety of our employees in the Ukraine and being able to
just provide cybersecurity services which are part of our ability to provide help,
where help is needed.
I think ultimately, our ability to contribute to what will be a -- and here is a
humanitarian crisis remains something that both us and our industry and every
industry can contribute to helping alleviate. We did announce that, of course, we're
complying with government sanctions. And then secondly, we've stopped new sales
in Russia -- to customers inside Russia through our Russian subsidiaries.
In terms of impact, I think for this audience, you mean revenue. I tend to start with
everything else, and revenues. That was the least important concept, you talk about
when it comes to this topic. But Russia represents less than 1% of our revenue and I
assume that there will be an impact to that less than 1% of our revenue. But frankly, it
would not be a focus.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it, got it. There is just a broader concern amongst investors of contingent,
resource crisis are going higher, consumers could get scared out of spending. In
your view, we talked about these digital transformation initiatives. We've seen your
bookings do really well in the back of these digital transformation initiatives, which
tend to be multi-year endeavors by these enterprises.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

Page 3 of 17A - Amy Hood
Q - Keith Weiss
A - Amy HoodHow do you feel about the durability of those digital transformation projects even in
a more disruptive sort of macro environment or even with the threat of potential
recession in Europe?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yeah, I think in general, and we've talked about this. Whenever there are -- I think the
question generally has been asked about labor was the ﬁrst input costs that we got
asked, would it impact digital transformation? I think other inﬂationary pressures
such as I think, in this instance probably energy pricing tends to be the ﬁrst one,
people talk about.
The best way we know how to help customers talk through how to control costs, how
to be more eﬀective, how to make every dollar you spend, be spent in the right
place with the most impact is in fact technology. It's always been a way to address
fundamental challenges. In some ways, I think that's true across many topics being
able to speed the pace of addressing those challenges.
And so I think for us the conversations tend to still be around that. It's about how do I
get the most out of my workforce? How do I get the most out of the unit of input?
How do I get the most out of my COGS pricing, right? How do I ﬁnd a way to make
sure I'm running the most impactful programs, whether those programs are our
marketing program, sales program, engineering program, a pricing change? And I
think that tends to be the conversations we do in fact still have and so.
In many ways, it's hard to put what's happening into the bucket of -- disruption is not
the right word. But I do believe in the durability of a transition that says, as we talked
about tech will be a larger percentage of GDP, a signiﬁcantly larger percentage of
GDP, tech enabled change will continue to be a tailwind for those that are well
positioned across segments and industries and across the globe to deliver that to
customers and so because I believe that is a durable trends, it keeps me pretty
grounded. And I think it keeps the customer -- our employees focused on the right
things amongst other distractions, whether that's a question around how do I -- how
can I help a customer? That's the right question. How can I help a customer address
their biggest challenge?
And while you may have a labor challenge, the right question is, let me make the
most of what you have. Let me show you tools that don't require advanced
engineering degrees or computer science degrees to be eﬀective, right. And so I
feel really good about those underlying trends for us.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
It sounds like you're talking a lot about -- you said, to get the most out of -- get more
out of it is productivity enhancing types of technologies. It reminds me of what Satya
has been saying about software being a deﬂationary technology in an inﬂationary
environment.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 17Q - Keith Weiss
A - Amy HoodI think that's, yes. He's -- I think that is, in a summary, how he thinks about it. And then
when you think about deﬂationary pressure and I think productivity is a way of saying
it. I think in our world, where people say productivity, they think about the Microsoft
365 Suite and really what it is that so much broader than that. It's like wait, if you can
cut the time to develop a new product, I guess that's productivity.
It's not the standard deﬁnition of productivity that people use when they apply it to
Microsoft, or maybe you can do business process work with non-CF degree
employees to change the process and take out some steps and how it be done in
half the time. That's productivity. It's not productivity in the way, I think that -- people
people think about us. So I guess productivity suite, it's fundamental enhancement
to productivity. Maybe, which is the curve everybody has been trying to actually
improve for decades.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. So I want to shift gears a little bit and really dig into some of the biggest
opportunities ahead for Microsoft. We recently did a big report on Microsoft looking
out kind of over the next ﬁve years in our view and what were the big growth
opportunities are and we cut the report to kind of two segments. One was
leveraging the broad user base of Microsoft.
I think you guys reported over $400 million commercial oﬃce users out there within
your base. And there's a lot of your initiatives that are bound sort of the user and sort
of more solutions you could drive into that user. The second bucket, we put it into
with the platform. Right. And that's sort of building larger solutions on top of Azure.
Starting on the user base side of the equation. I think, one of the key focal points for
investors is obviously Oﬃce 365 and where we are in the transition? And can you
talk to us about kind of where are we in terms of sort of moving over to Oﬃce 365?
The seat growth in the overall commercial base I think has surprised people the
upside, is there still more room to go on there? I mean we'll start on the Q side of the
equation, how the seats growing?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Keith, your questions are sometimes so long. I need to bring a notebook. But I think
we start -- I got through most of it and then I just even with my real focus on your
speech, I got pulled this straight. I think what you actually asked was the Q, that part I
remember, and I'm guessing, since that was the key, it's about seat growth and really
-- and then we'll get to, I'm guessing prices. The P-times Q that -- so you could've just
asked me (multiple speakers) about I could've really killed it.
Equation to how I work. I mean, I'm going to have you do an excel at time. It's just to
be easier for me. So back to users. There's really -- I think in some ways, if I look back
a decade almost, to how long we've been talking about Oﬃce 365 or Microsoft 365
and our ability to land a solution, I think we probably underestimated the number of
people for which this was applicable, and our ability to build new solutions to
address them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 17Q - Keith Weiss
A - Amy HoodSo what you've heard talk about recently, and you've seen that in our seat growth,
especially over the past, I would say, two years where people have been surprised
with this durability is that, the ability of that solution set to reach into two places
more directly.
First would be small and mid-sized businesses, which for us tends to be -- a
deﬁnition of that would be entities with less than 300-ish seats. Right. So they are still
a pretty big, but we would call that small to mid-sized in our language that we use.
And then secondly frontline worker. And there is about 2 billion of those around the
world for whether you can address with diﬀerent types of solutions that really make a
diﬀerence to that fundamental productivity we've been talking about. So when
you're seeing the seat growth, and is it durable and how far we along the journey, we
just have a long way to go, with solutions that can I think, really add fundamental
value to their productivity, to the joy of doing your job, being able to complete that
job easier, feeling empowered in your job and so I'm excited about the progress
there. And so that's the Q. I don't want to guess. But if you can ask about the
peanuts, I'm ready.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
All right. Next question, what's the P look like? I just keep it short enough.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Here we call back Keith at work. We call that the growth mindset, because when you
get feedback, you take it in and you learn and I get feedback a lot of work on this
topic and I was just going to say, you did great.
So on the peak, which in this sense, I'll talk about as both pricing, which I know we
get asked about and price changes. And then secondarily, our ability to have users
adopt more of the suite or more solutions to raise price overtime.
So ﬁrst I feel really -- I feel good about where we are on pricing. We have some price
changes go into eﬀect, again, this month, beginning at next month. I lose track of
March this month. Great. It's March. And so the ability to realize that price, I feel
strongly about there is a ton of value and the SKU. We continue to add value and so I
think that's being well executed.
The more exciting part has always been the ability to add new value to SKU for users
and companies around the world to feel and get more value. In some ways, I think
we've talked a lot about security. So people always kind of start and stop with
security as the value and because we've given more I think, revenue points on that,
people have an understanding of how big that opportunity is for us.
Beyond that I think compliance and there's a lot of room, I think, to continue to move
people as we've said E5. So, security, compliance, analytics value, power of BI is
really the default tool for analytics and it's to come that, we've seen great growth, I
feel really good about our progress on that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

Page 6 of 17Q - Keith Weiss
A - Amy Hood
Q - Keith WeissAnd then ﬁnally one we've been talking about a little more lately, Teams Phone,
which we've talked about as voice and telephony. We've seen really strong growth
there as well. And those pillars, I think, add a lot of opportunity for us, right, to both
cut costs for customers, and let them have a better and more integrated experience.
And so we've got some room for sure on ARPU as well, and the job there is to
continue to make sure people understand the full value of the suite. All four legs of
that E5 tool have a ton of utility to them and they are quite competitive on their own.
And then if you think about them as a suite, certainly oﬀer very compelling value. So
we've got some good room there as well.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Is there ever a time when will see in E7 SKU of that more functionality comes
into the suite?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
It's interesting. I get asked that a lot. And I could see why in excel, if you go 135,
there's a decent question on 7. And so I would tell you though, right now, there's
been a lot more focus on whether or not -- and we continue to think through this,
and you've seen us move a little bit down this path, whether you're better oﬀ
oﬀering some standalone solutions that you would sell in addition to E5 and may be
not call it a suite.
I say things like that, Viva, it is a terriﬁc example. Viva will be monetized mostly
outside of the suites. That experience is resonating incredibly well with customers
around the world that we've just really started talking about, it releasing very early
components. The desire for employers to be able to have a real pulse in terms of
employee engagement, employee learning and skilling, right, that blasts the type of,
I think, example where I would think. I'm not sure that's the right move is to put it in a
suite. Got a great standalone value, people should adopt it and deploy it directly.
Having that be a direct sale makes a ton of sense to me.
The other thing to think about is a lot of the new -- I would call productivity tools,
may in fact look a little bit more like consumption that you would normally associate
with Azure, maybe you have on the backend, limits, right, and that would be --
deploy it and the more you use the more you put pay. Otherwise -- and I guess it's
value pricing. But it's -- I think I tend not to limit the scope of Microsoft 365 or Oﬃce
365 to a concept that says it has to be in the suite and it must be for user. It's pretty
narrow. It's actually -- I wouldn't say pretty narrow, I now believe it to be narrow and
too narrow for what that cloud opportunity and footprint can be.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. What came into my head, did not in necessarily E7 oﬀering, but like a natural
extension of what we've seen, Power VI is going to be in E5 suite, the power of
platform more broadly. There are two other legs of that stool that we're hearing
good indications on that. There is a lot of customer demand for that are automatingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

Page 7 of 17A - Amy Hood

A - Amy Hood
Q - Keith Weissthose processes. Can you dig in a little bit in terms of the sort of the opportunity
around Power Platform and where you guys are seeing the initial fraction of that?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yeah, I think it is if -- you were to ask me, hey, in terms of proactive conversations
with customers, where they bring tools up, this would be near the top of the list. I
think for very good reason. We just talked about, if you deﬁne the desire for
deﬂationary pressure, is the ability to adjust business process eﬀectively with a quick
time to value, using labor that is closer to the problem as a subject matter experts,
Let's say, you look at that problem set and say, gosh, what would be a good tool?
Well, it would be Power Platform, being able to take a far broader parts of the
organization, no matter what organization or industry you're in, apply that work in
those workers who are closest to the workﬂow to the problem solving, being able to
have them deploy tools. I think, which people like to call low-code no-code but it
makes people like me, to be able to deploy business process adjustments.
If I can do it, it means, trust me that many, many people can do it. In our ﬁnance
organization we see it every day. Our ﬁnance team is able to capture those business
changes without needing. Although I love our core engineering and IT organization.
If we're capable, we should do it and if you get compliance and security by default
through those processes, there's really no better people to be adjusting and making
those decisions.
So I think what we see in our own organization or in my own organization is certainly
what customers are seeing and I think it's a great opportunity for us as a company to
especially in a place where labor and labor-constrained is a real challenge, to be
able to have a product that is in the right place.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Right. Is it -- I mean is that where you're seeing the initial question, like when we think
about sort of RPA tooling, robotic process automation and low-code, oftentimes it's
starting in the ﬁnance department and the accounting organizations. That's the
whole true for Power Platform as well?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I'm not sure I could narrow it in that direction. We've seen it -- seen that in marketing
departments. We've seen that in supply chain. We've seen that in ﬁnance. I think
there's a lot of places. I think it more -- I have always felt like, it's not necessarily
about the certain processes are easier to apply it to, it's more about the desire of an
organization to eﬀect change.
So I might answer that with more of a culture comment than necessarily certain
products or industries or more. It's easier or not. It's just more I think a world view.

Page 8 of 17A - Amy Hood
Q - Keith Weiss
A - Amy Hood
Q - Keith WeissGot it. I want to touch on two other of the more kind of user base products. One is
LinkedIn, which I think has surprised a lot of guys to the upside in terms of...
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Lot of people,
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
A lot of people, the upside, that -- the lot of people to the upside in terms of the
durability of growth and that solution hitting the -- really hitting the right nodes in
terms of sales enablement, but also kind of recruiting, particularly in labor market.
Can you give us a little bit of an update on kind of where we are with like the
software side of the equation when it comes to LinkedIn?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yeah. It's interesting. It may have surprised people, I would say, probably didn't
surprise us as much. LinkedIn is an indispensable tool for millions and millions of
people around the world to ﬁnd their economic opportunity. So if you boil down the
purpose of an entity to allow people to better themselves to their families and better
their security, by ﬁnding the right job opportunities for them, by getting the right
skills.
The application of that tool then is quite broad. And the utility is quite needed. And
so if you think about -- really and I think what Ryan and the team have done there is
quite extraordinary in terms of their execution and relentless focus on mission that
matters, which is to deliver that experience in a better and better way everyday.
And so I think what you've seen is real growth in users but also real growth in
engagement. There is fundamental things then provide -- as long as you're providing
and you keep it your core that mission, it then has utility for recruiters and HR
organizations around the world, has utility for marketing teams around the world in
terms of business to business connections and you've seen that in some of the ad
growth numbers we released.
We now have the four businesses that LinkedIn all reaching that billion dollar
threshold and the organization itself, still growing at a very healthy clip given its
scale. And I think it derives from a relentless focus on the member. And as long as I
think the team is focused on that, adding value and whether that's through mobile
capabilities or whether it's investing and really critical things when you have a pretty
remarkable labor market, maybe skills based hiring which I think people are going to
hear more and more about, adding tools to address that to make sure people can
ﬁnd the exact right talent regardless, maybe of some of the other more historic ways
to ﬁnd talent. So I'm pretty optimistic about LinkedIn business.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Excellent. I wanted to talk about Dynamics 365. And I think it's a under-appreciated
part of the story. I math sort of the growth trajectory of Dynamics 365 versus theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 17A - Amy Hoodother sort of big SaaS companies that we think about ServiceNow, Salesforce and
Workday, Dynamics 365 is right along with the leader ServiceNow within that, as I
said it passed through $4 billion kind of annualized run rate has been as good as
anything we've seen in SaaS.
What's working on that side of the equation? You re-platform a couple of years ago.
How are you guys, able to scale like that and what's the potential on a go-forward
basis?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yeah, I think in -- and I think we're taking a journey down the P&L, which is
interesting. And so next, literally, visually, in the P&L it's (inaudible) So it makes sense
in my excel spreadsheet. So this team has done a nice job. Five years ago, as you
said, we did a re-platforming, but more importantly I think what we realized is that
we needed to make Dynamics 365 in addition to the most modern business process
reinvention application set.
It needed to be module -- I can't ever say this word, [ph]mud juvarized. I'm not even
sure that's the word. Now that I've said it. The point being, we needed to make
smaller more consumable pieces, right, easier to deploy, quicker time to value, more
applicable to your industry or solutions that.
When the team has done that, it's both -- how does that has a great tool and a more
focused go to market. Then you say, well, what really can make Dynamics 365
diﬀerent? Those two things make a lot of diﬀerence. But of course, it's also its
applicability of the Microsoft Cloud and what problem that you are really trying to
solve and you start by saying, number one, you need to focus on data problem. You
need access to the right data to make good business process decisions.
Secondly, you want to apply AI where you can to that problem to make decision
making more -- with more eﬀective and more eﬃcient. And ﬁnally, you want to make
the tool accessible. And I think Dynamics is focused on those things, enabled by the
fact that the Microsoft Cloud has a lot of ability sitting at the platform layer to help
the Dynamics team achieve those goals, and I think in a really innovative way.
It also took frankly some investment on the sales side. Sales process is a little
diﬀerent for business applications. It takes some time, but more importantly you sell
to diﬀerent people. We thought a lot of people in the buying community inside an
organization. But there is members of people who have budgets inside orgs that we
didn't spend as much time with by the nature of the business as we were in. And
really when you think about where is the Dynamics applicable, Judson, our Head of
Sales, often says it's applicable in every room of your house and I think that's a good
way of thinking about it. Meaning it's applicable at every component of the business,
every budget and so the ability for us to address those needs to really focus on
customer solutions, focus on customer problems, it's been a focusing point for the
cloud story even beyond just the Dynamic story.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

A - Amy HoodAnd so I think you've seen that in our results. I think it's a place where there
continues to be very -- there is a lot of opportunity for us to continue that growth. I
think you'll see us talk a lot about more industry level applicability, helping people
understand exactly what problem they can solve in their industry, not necessarily by
adding technology but we're adding context which matters a lot.
So I think it's one of the places I started with Power Platform. I was excited about that.
And we're excited about LinkedIn. So now I'm excited about Dynamics. I'm excited
to -- you're asking about next. You're on a good streak.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
One more question on Dynamics, the target customer for their, I think a lot of
investors think of it more as a mid-market.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I know, it's not.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
I think all that for saying that...
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
No, its not about folding. This for me is a 100% -- the only proof is the who's
adopting it.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Right. As I said like, I'm a data person. So we develop products maybe historically, as
you know that team was developed through acquisitions done long time ago. And
the acquisitions we did were more focused in the mid-market. I would say, not sure
how to deﬁne it exactly, mid markets a fair term.
But really what this does is, these are about -- the ultimate department deployments.
Maybe organization deployments. They run alongside other business applications.
They may be one next to or around, maybe it's -- and so I think now it's safe to say,
we've seen some of the largest organizations in the world adopting Dynamics to
solve a problem.
So I think it's absolutely fair for people to have thought that's the market. I think we
actually even told people that was the market. I think at this point the market is, if
there is a problem that can be solved by a module that this best does, then that's a
good customer for us. And we should help them do that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

Got it. Want to shift gears to more platform side of the equation and talking about
sort of the big growth driver in our model at least which is Azure. And the market
opportunity ahead for Azure, Jason Zander, the EVP of Azure, he talked about a top-
down market for Azure, the TAM being as highest $4 trillion, $1 trillion if you look at it
just from an IT speciﬁc. These are massive numbers. Can you help us understand
where does the budget dollars come from?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
It's interesting. I think, if we go back, and I think Satya and I both talked about this
relatively consistently. Every time we've thought the market with size excess usually
been bigger on this topic. And it's almost as if you took every line item, literally
everyone not like the P&L, I mean literally every PO, purchase order opened, every
process run inside any company around the world.
And said, can this be run more eﬀectively, more eﬃciently? And the answer likely is
yes. And the tool to do that is likely technology. So then when you ask somebody
how do you deﬁne how big that market is? The answer is it's a very big. And then
you ask, okay the two other -- are there businesses that are possible because, you
can now run a distributed system with real-time data, enabled by AI, are there
businesses that are possible, absolutely.
And so I think it's why you see -- I think most people feel incredibly optimistic over
any period of time about the size of the market. I don't think anyone feels
constrained by market TAM. You take other constraints, not that one.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
So when you're talking to a customer about Azure, and then I know customers are
thinking about it in terms of sort of where does the budget come from. Traditionally
we've seen -- we've said it comes from servers and storage and not buying anymore,
but then it expanded to the software stack and are buying the databases anymore
and that's coming through Azure. But I'd imagine it also extends to telco and
networking and human cost and administration. Do the customer see it that way or
do they understand sort of the full value replacement that comes with Azure?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Interesting. I would tell you, most of the conversations do not start with, where does
the budget come from? I'm not trying to be dismissive of budget. I love the budget,
trust me, really take great pride in budgeting. But customer conversations tend to
start with, I like to grow faster. I'd like to win more. I'd like to better serve a customer.
I'd like to improve customer state. I'd like to reduce churn. I'd like to grow price. I'd
like to retain margin. I mean it's just not about cost in the way that the questions
raised. It's much more about like the problem to be solved. And the problem to be
solved, hence they take about language to it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

A - Amy HoodThe implementation is generally and can be Azure, Dynamics or Oﬃce 365 or other
security, it can be a bucket of good to that problem. But it tends to not start there.
And so when people say, okay, well, how does it get paid for? It may be, to your
point, replacement dollars moving your budget priorities around. It may be that you
say, gosh, I mean, if you can lower churn by 0.5 point, there's a lot of top-line growth
to aﬀord costs. As you get room room in the system, so I feel like, I don't know that
I've been in many conversations where that's been the energy of the room I'm in. But
I'm sure that it lands somewhere, right, ultimately, but it's much easier, I always say to
ﬁnd money in their budget, when the passion of the team is around growth. You can
ﬁnd the money, even if it's hard.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
To me, it's -- it sounds like over the past four or ﬁve years, the conversations that
Microsoft is having and I'm assuming like the contracting behind that is shifting from
being a technology provider to a more strategic relationship you're forming with
these companies like in Albertson or forward who are looking to really drive change
in their business. Is that -- the structure of the contract of structure of that relationship
today diﬀerent than it was ﬁve years ago or 10 years ago when Microsoft was more of
a technology provider?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Interesting, Keith. I want to say yes to that. The reason I say it's diﬀerent, but maybe
not materially diﬀerent. We've always tried to have customer -- to have contracting
reﬂect customer desire for that structure. Having said, as you all know, because you
can see it in sort of the rhythm of our exploration base, I get to drone on about on
the quarterly call is, there is a reality to the three-year contract, especially on the
oﬃce side or on-premise part of the business or the Oﬃce 365 business.
What we are seeing and I think that's what you're alluding to is maybe on the Azure
side of the business, are those contracts taking a very diﬀerent ﬂare? And do we try
to make them look like the old? The answer is you tried really hard not to make them
look like the all, because it's not the right answer for the customer. So you may
actually and we've talked about it, you may get these big long contracts, you know,
and you'll hear us talk about the remaining RPO with longer than a year, less than a
year and all of that is just the nature of that transition.
So, yeah, you got some big ones with commitments made upfront. Maybe you do it
for price reasons or maybe you do it because you want to work and have laid out
speciﬁc workloads and that made the contracting a better tool or maybe frankly
you're really large customer or you just prefer Pega and pay as you go, right, maybe
that's just your preferred method. That's okay too,
I remind people that Azure is unique in that regard. Right. I mean you got to use it for
it to show up on the P&L. So whether you contracted it and it's sitting at book --
sitting in the RPO, it only really really counts, if it gets deployed use loved and adds
value, which is revenue. And so the contracting language far more important to just
make sure you're getting workloads deployed and the customer is getting value far,
far more than it is two years, three years, ﬁve years, seven years, two weeks.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

Got it, got it. How should investors think about the Azure growth equation evolving
in terms of, is it workload growth, is it -- or the mix between sort of what's workload
growth, how much of it is moving from sort of more core services like infrastructure
service up to the platform services, like a database or machine learning service on
top of it? And I guess it comes back to the Ps and Qs, is it more of a Q equation still
on a go-forward basis or now are we getting higher value services becoming a
bigger part of the mix and that's increasing the P?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yeah, I think if you go back to TAM, if you assume you have a market this large, I
don't generally feel a gap. There is a Q challenge, right. Q in this instance on a
consumption model is just literally growing usage of workloads and adoption. Right.
And the workloads you picked and are they expanding and I think that tends to not
be the constraints, would be, I think what you're asking is pricing and margin actually
tend to be the bigger nuances, right. When you've got Q growth, it does depend
where it lands in order to how really gross margin looks.
I still feel good about platform. But what I think you would call core infra growth. But
you are saying and we have seen obviously very good growth in our data platform
layers and increasingly other what we would call premium service layers. And it's not
just workloads shifting, right. I think Q feels constrained to people who feel like it's
left hand, right hand, right.
Take on-prem workloads that exist, shift them like shift right. That is not what being
seen today, right. It's new workloads, new things that frankly weren't being
considered before and so you don't see that just a shift of spend, it's a shift plus new,
And it looks quite diﬀerent, so. I think -- and when you see those shift to new, it's a
combination of data generally and core platform overtime.
Sometimes people ask me which one would be bigger? I know that I have an answer
to that. I expect Q to grow in both. Growth may look better on the data side, just
because it's oﬀ a smaller relative base given when the transitions happen, But I I'd
have to think more about that one.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Even if it has been getting in education on how consumption models work, right.
This is deﬁnitely diﬀerent ﬁrm. We've gone through perpetual licenses to
subscription now functions that I think we're doing a lot of learning. How should we
think about or how do you think about price performance. Right. How much price
performance are you looking to push that to the end customer, so they consistently
see sort of increasing value from the platform. How much sort of price performance
and eﬃciencies that you've garnered from Azure become better gross margins?

Page 14 of 17Q - Keith Weiss
A - Amy HoodI'm trying to think which of your questions, I'll start with. I think number one, we --
this is a competitive market, where prices are set by the market. So I don't tend to
think of it as, hey, wait, we have all these eﬃciencies. We've gained where do they sit.
A better way to think about it is consumption mark -- it's a marketplace like any other
in some ways.
It's a competitive market with lots of big players competing aggressively, means
prices move down with time and new prices with new workloads, new capabilities,
whether it's higher diﬀerentiation tend to have more margin and others have less.
I don't -- and then I separately believe in a competitive market that you should and
do, spend a lot of time making sure your fundamentals are terriﬁc, which means you
focus on cost per unit of work. You've seen that in the gross margin improvements.
Team has done a great job frankly on that front and continues to do a great job on
that front.
The reason you focus on that is because ultimately in a competitive market, cost is
price. Right. You want to make sure you continue to address in fundamentals, great
service, great quality, easy deployment, low cost, low cost to deploy and
diﬀerentiation lets you have leverage in margins.
So we'll stay focused on gross margin. We will stay focused on winning. We'll stay
focused on taking share. And we'll stay focused on the fact this is a very large
market, that can have I think, a lot of good tailwinds and we're well positioned in it.
So sort of, you have gives and takes on that on the margin side, but in general, we
focus on, I think where it's controllable.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Right. One last question on the commercial side. I want to touch on a couple of
consumer and more corporate strategy questions. Within server and tools, that's
been a much more durable grower than a lot of people imagined. Hybrid cloud
advantage has been a great program for Microsoft, unlocked a lot of sort of I would
say latent demand, if a -- CIOs and sort of your customers not getting locked into
one side of the equation and the other. Does there come a point where the
customer takes advantage of that hybrid cloud advantage and start shifting more to
Azure versus on premise and that starts to become a headwind?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I don't know, I would call that happening a headwind. The way we've always thought
about the hybrid program was really customer needs, customer need and desire to
run the workloads in the most eﬀective place to run the workload and where they
want to run -- where frankly they want to run it.
The enablement of that ﬂexibility is what we call the hybrid program. And so for us,
and I really do believe this, as why I focus on the overall KPI even though everybody
really just doesn't want to do that, it's because that's how customers purchase. And
so if you want to -- and that so I'm always saying like listen, adopt ﬂexibility.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

A - Amy HoodIf you don't know when you want to move workloads, if you don't know, but you're
committed to Windows and you're committed to stipple, then this is a great and
ﬂexible option to give customers the absolute most control. Now overtime, I guess
they move more to Azure, I would quote unquote heavy headwind to on-prem
revenue. I don't know in my world view that the headwinds strategically.
That just customers continuing to use our products and services in the best way that
works for them. It would likely show up as Azure revenue and it would then not show
up on-prem revenue. I don't feel badly about that and I -- don't loose a lot of sleep
over it. If the reason that you see ﬂowing on-prem growth is you're seeing faster shift
to Azure, I view that is a good thing.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Moving to more personal computing.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
We got there. We've got three minutes left, my friend. I mean, almost made it
through the P&L. We're going to get through it.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
I'll shorten my questions even more. I would say over the last two conference calls,
the tone from you and Satya on PCs has been surprisingly strong about sort of the
changing nature of PCs on a go-forward basis. And probably a question I get a lot
from investors is like what are they saying that we're not. So, if you talk to us a little
bit about that more positive tone on PCs.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I think in some ways, the bigger issue and you just hearing a positive turn on PCs is
frankly the deliver or which is made. I should have been talking about Windows.
Absolutely, the role of large screen devices to your productivity and your ability to
do your job every day. What we saw in the past two years was proof that that's true,
and have been true.
The utility of that device in my inability to accurately explain it, may in fact either is
issue, people are just now realizing, wow! she just ﬁgured out. Windows matters. No,
I just ﬁgured out how to talk about it. And so the reality is, a large screen device over
the past couple of years, we've all been reminded of the role it plays. There are more
PCs for household and more time being spent on PCs. We're continuing to see that
even with hybrid.
And so there are just jobs to be done and it plays a great role in many jobs to be
done. Windows 11, I think it's a great investment and having a modern beautiful user
experience for Windows. We're seeing good response to it. But people love
Windows 10 too, and that's great. I'm thrilled, in fact, that what you're seeing is a
more holistic version of what Windows and the experience should be for user.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

A - Amy HoodThe diﬀerence that that world view is made is evident, I think in many places. It's
evident in the strength of the Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions. It's evident in
browser share grant games. It's evident in the search numbers. It's the simplicity of
having Windows work for you as a user, and it being a meaningful positive
experience. That makes your days better.
I have said, you know, Excel may brings me joy. But other things bring other people
joy that they do on a PC. Gaming is a terriﬁc example. Windows has always been the
place people games, always. And bring you up your back, integrating it into a user
experience. I don't know, I ﬁnd it, I think in some ways, this is one where whatever
review form I got this year should say, she forgot about to talk about Windows for a
long time. And now we're going to remedy that because you're seeing it in users.
You're seeing it in usage. You're seeing it in the market.
We've had eight quarters of demand that's never been seen before. People talk
about supply constraints or absolutely as supply constraints in the system. This is the
eight highest quarters of PC demand we've seen ever of shipments. So the market is
stepping up. Partners are stepping up. But there is more demand than there is
supply, even with record shipments. And so, I feel good about -- I am optimistic. I'm
more optimistic about Windows can mean to a user. And how we can continue to
make it better, more integrated, make it easier to do the things you like to do. For me
that's Excel, for others maybe something else is fun.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. I want to sneak in one last question on OpEx. I think people have been very
impressed by your ability to both trying to fund the growth within Microsoft but also
continually ﬁnd eﬃciencies within the business to grow operating margins. Is there
still kind of room on the eﬃciency side of the equation as to fund that equation on a
go-forward basis?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Well, I mean, we had 16% head count growth last quarter. So in many ways, we -- I'm
excited to be able to do that. We spent, I don't know 40 minutes talking about our
optimism over any long period of time on revenue and the opportunity that exist. In
order to capture that ultimately you need people, you need people who are excited
to work on it. People who want to sell. People who want to help customers deploy.
And so I actually feel really good about that investment.
Even more so, I also still believe you can spend dollars better. I mean the team, -- I
mean, I don't know, I just always think if you're not reinventing yourself, if you're not
moving your dollars around, if you're not asking yourself every single day, can you
do better, can we move things around, can it make me -- maybe we don't have all
the right bets on the table.
If you don't move it, ask yourself, I mean I love it. I mean, that's like. I mean. Okay,
second to excel, I love headcount budgets. Because to ask about asking yourself
every day can you do better? Can you do better for customers? Can you do better
for the engineering team? Can you make their process work diﬀerently? Can youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

something shift faster? Like it's just, I don't know to yeah, nobody is also hooked you,
Keith. I can still ﬁnd ways to be more eﬃcient. We can still do things better. And yes,
we still need to grow.
All those things can happen and still have good operating leverage. But the best
thing to do is top line growth mix everything else is here. So if we execute at the top
and makes a lot of moving around far, far easier day to that, so.
