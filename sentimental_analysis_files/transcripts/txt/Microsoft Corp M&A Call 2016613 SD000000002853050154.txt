{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thank you, Chris. Thank you for joining us. Before turning to the news about this
deal, Jeﬀ and I wanted to take a moment to express our condolences and
sympathies for the victims and people of Orlando. There should be no place in the
world for violence and hatred exhibited this weekend.
Let me turn to the information we wanted to share with you this morning. This deal
brings together the world's leading professional cloud and the world's leading
professional network. Let's start by going through some of the deal speciﬁcs.
Microsoft will acquire LinkedIn for $196 per share in an all-cash transaction value at
approximately $26.2 billion inclusive of LinkedIn's net cash. LinkedIn will retain its
distinct brand, culture and independence; Jeﬀ Weiner will remain CEO, report to me
and join the Microsoft team and leadership team. Reid Hoﬀman has stated his full
support for the transaction, which the LinkedIn Board recommended unanimously in
his intention to vote all his shares in accordance with the Board's recommendation.
And we expect this transaction to close by this calendar year.
As I think about acquisitions, it is important to call out how I think about them in
terms of the dimensions that we evaluate. First, is this an asset that will expand our
opportunity? Speciﬁcally, does it expand our total addressable market? Is this an
asset that's riding the secular technology trends and is this core to who we are and
our core mission as well as sense of purpose and structural position? And when I
look at those three dimensions, LinkedIn really checks all the boxes.
It starts with the mission; LinkedIn and Microsoft share a mission. When we talk about
Microsoft mission, we talk about empowering every person and every organization
and the planet to achieve more. There is no better way to really realize that mission
than to connect the world's professionals to make them more productive and
successful. That's really what this merger and this acquisition is about. So let me, withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-13

Page 3 of 21Jeﬀ Weiner
Satya Nadellathat, turn it over to Jeﬀ to talk a little bit about the vibrancy of the LinkedIn asset, as
we see it today.
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks, Satya. So on the next slide, we've captured in a bit of the highlights in
terms of our ongoing progress and momentum with regard to the membership now
up to north of 433 million; worth calling out there, China remains our fastest growing
and not surprising, given the size of the addressable opportunity there. One in ﬁve
of the world's knowledge workers and students, pre-professionals, if you will, reside
within China so that continues to be a focus area for us.
105 million monthly actives and that year-over-year growth rate reﬂects an
acceleration, not only in mobile but desktop as well. A byproduct of the recent
investment we made in the re-imagination of our mobile application. And you can
see the carryover eﬀect in terms of the growing engagement in the section below
that. Mobile now accounts for about 60% of our traﬃc and we continue to expect
that to grow. Then lastly with regard to our revenue and results, Talent Solutions
comprises roughly two-thirds of our overall business. You can see in 2015, it was up
41% year over year. And sponsored content within our Marketing Solutions line
continues to be the fastest-growing business at scale.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Great, thank you, Jeﬀ. The opportunity ahead for us is to realize this mission that
both Jeﬀ and I referenced. And that's the most exciting part. And the way we do that
is by driving the product usage and engagement across LinkedIn, Oﬃce 365 and
Dynamics, that's really truly become the core of what Microsoft does. And we'll
accelerate that engagement and usage through a variety of diﬀerent business
models: subscriptions for individuals, subscriptions for organizations as well as
advertising. So that's really the opportunity ahead.
When you think about the total addressable market, it goes up by 58% but to give
you a bit of a feel for it, you should think about how Dynamics, for example, gets
enhanced with LinkedIn Recruiter, how Dynamics get enhanced with Sales Navigator
and Social Selling. How you can take some of the learning solutions of LinkedIn and
then build out the full learning management solutions. The marketing solutions that
LinkedIn has and our distribution. Then of course, not to forget Oﬃce 365 usage
which is at the core of Microsoft and the LinkedIn usage. So this is how we realize the
total addressable market and our share of this total addressable market is just 9%. So
we see plenty of opportunity going forward.
Now, we already have a great position here. Some of the numbers in this slide, I
think, are well known to you. We have over 1.2 billion users of Oﬃce, now over 300
million active devices running Windows 10; 70 million MAU, or monthly active users
of Oﬃce 365. Dynamics is 8 million paid seats. Now you take all of that and look at
LinkedIn, 433 million members, 105 million monthly active users. And all of the other
data you see on this slide.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 21Jeﬀ Weiner
Satya NadellaNow, besides the numbers though, what's underneath that is this rich information
graph. What we have at Microsoft today is what we refer to as the Microsoft graph
where people and their relationships, their calendars, their work artifacts, their
projects as well as what's inside of business systems, whether it be leads and
prospects; all of that is connected as one information graph. Of course, LinkedIn has
a similar graph. It is about the professional network. It's about you, your job history,
your skills, the people you know in your profession; and if you connect these two
graphs, that's when the magic starts to happen in terms of how digital work gets
completed. We really can transform the life of professionals in terms of completing it
and let me just turn it over to Jeﬀ to talk a little bit about some of the vision he has
shared here.
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
So one of the things both Satya and I are excited about is when you combine
Microsoft's corporate graph with LinkedIn's professional graph, we think we're going
to be able to take a very substantial leap forward in terms of the realization of our
vision, which is creating economic opportunity for every member of the global
workforce and we're going to do that through the development of the world's ﬁrst
economic graph. That's a digital mapping of the global economy.
For those of you a little less familiar with this, it's something at LinkedIn we've been
talking about for several years now. The economic graph envisions a proﬁle on
LinkedIn for every one of the three billion members of the global workforce; a digital
representation for every company in the world, somewhere in the order of between
60 and 70 million companies when you include small and medium-size businesses.
A digital representation for every one of the job availabilities made possible by
those companies on the order of 20 million-plus; a digital reﬂection representation
of every skill required to obtain those jobs; and through our Lynda acquisition, the
course work to make that possible.
A digital proﬁle for every university or higher educational organization, vocational
training facility that enables people to acquire the skills they need to get the jobs
oﬀered by those companies. Then lastly, a publishing platform that facilitates the
sharing of professionally relevant knowledge between individuals, companies and
universities to the extent they are interested in doing so.
The goal is then to take a step back and to allow capital, all forms of capital:
intellectual capital, working capital and human capital, to ﬂow to where it can best
be leveraged. And in so doing, help transform and lift the global economy. We now
believe through this combination, we're going to be better positioned to make that
possible.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Great. And so let me now take you through a couple of illustrations to bring this
home. I want to start, in fact, with talking about more of usage of Oﬃce 365 and
LinkedIn and how that will get lit up and really help drive engagement on both sides.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 21Jeﬀ WeinerTake the most obvious one, which is the proﬁle. LinkedIn essentially becomes the
social fabric across all of Microsoft, whether it is in Outlook, in Excel or Skype or
PowerPoint or Word or SharePoint. Now you have the ability, whenever you're
looking up a contact, not only to see that contact with the information that's
contained in active directory. But you can get at the full richness of their information
in the professional network and who are all the others in their professional network.
So that's what we mean by the social fabric of your digital work and Oﬃce 365.
Another scenario is something I'm very, very excited about is the newsfeed. It's the
fastest-growing engagement part of LinkedIn; this is where there's fantastic traction
on the mobile usage with the new ﬂagship app. And it's already a very relevant feed
based on what the LinkedIn proﬁle contains, which is you, your skills, your
profession, your company. And your industry. But just imagine now, that feed being
informed even by the projects you're currently working on; the calendar information,
essentially all the meetings into the next month that you have; the relevance of that
feed, bringing some of the AI and machine learning technology for Microsoft to
improve that on a continuous basis and drive engagement. Then of course, the ad
monetization that goes with it, which is one of the fastest-growing businesses in
LinkedIn. So we are very, very excited about the newsfeed and what it can do.
Of course, the next one is Cortana. Just imagine you are walking into a meeting and
Cortana now wakes up and tells you about the people you are meeting for the ﬁrst
time but tells you all the things that you want to know before walking in and meeting
someone because it has access to the professional network. Cortana is about
knowing everything about you, your organization, the world. And now, the
professional network. So really being able to reason about all of that and be your
personal digital assistant, that's truly the best professional digital assistant is a
fantastic opportunity.
So those are some of the end-user beneﬁts that drive intensity of usage across Oﬃce
365, in particular. And inside of LinkedIn itself. But it's just not just about that
because it's also about business process usage, whether it be CRM, whether it be
HR, whether it be Talent Management and learning. So I wanted you to get a bit of a
feel for that because I want Jeﬀ to go over some of these business process things
that we can do with LinkedIn and Dynamics and other products.
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
Thanks, Satya. So historically, at LinkedIn, for us, our overarching value proposition is
connecting to opportunity. That holds for both members and customers. And Satya
just touched on a few of the examples of how we will be able to create additional
value for members.
I'm going to now turn towards customers. And historically, it's been about several
diﬀerent areas of focus. Hire, market, sell and learn. And we think this combination
has the opportunity to tap new addressable markets that Satya mentioned earlier
and create true diﬀerentiation in the marketplace.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 21Let's start with Social Selling. It's something we've been focused on now for a couple
of years through our Sales Navigator tool. It provides business intelligence to
salespeople and enables them to take selling to social selling. What does that mean
speciﬁcally? It means being able to identify exactly the right prospect by virtue of
leveraging data ﬂowing through LinkedIn on a proprietary basis. It's connecting with
that prospect, turning cold calls into warm prospects by virtue of leveraging your
network to get the introduction, which can make all the diﬀerence in the world.
It's tapping and understanding of who that prospect is, to best engage with them
and reach out to them. And all of this is done in service of greater sales eﬃcacy and
closing the deal. Now we will be able to take that business intelligence tool, Sales
Navigator, deeply integrate that into Dynamics and CRM and we believe we can
change the game that way. So that would be one example.
Turning now to organizational insights and transformation. And this is going to be a
fun one for us. We have, arguably, the most unique and proprietary set of insights in
the world of recruiting and as a result of that, we've been able to transform and
disrupt the way recruiting works, speciﬁcally, able to scale what we call passive
candidate recruiting, which has disrupted the industry in a signiﬁcant way.
We are also able to provide insights to customers and a showstopper, historically,
has been what we call talent inﬂow and outﬂow. So you'll sit down with a company
and their executive team and CEO at a executive brieﬁng. And we will show them
where their talent is going to in terms of the competition. And where the talent is
coming from. Just brieﬂy and anecdotally, it is always fun to see the response
because when it's green and there's a lot of talent coming in from the competition,
the CEO says, this is the greatest day I've ever seen. I love this and when it's red,
they're like, this can't be right. I'm not losing talent to the competition. And it just
speaks to the importance of that kind of proprietary insight.
When you take Microsoft's assets, speciﬁcally in this case, volumetrics and this
acquisition that enables you to understand all kinds of business intelligence within
an organization that speaks to productivity, whether it's sales productivity,
organizational eﬀectiveness throughout the organization, you can start to paint the
picture of how we can create a platform here. How we can create a stack here. And
by virtue of Microsoft's deep relationships and workﬂow throughout the world, in
terms of their enterprise customers, we can change the game in that regard.
Then lastly, this is one that I think Satya and I would rate pretty highly on the
excitement scale. We're both very passionate about learning. And I think, share a
clear conviction and vision in terms of the fact that the days in which a professional
or any member of the global workforce, for that matter, could acquire a skill or
certiﬁcation, have a job for the rest of their lives, that's over, if not coming to an end.
People are going to need -- and that's by virtue of the pace and acceleration of
innovation. People need access to always on learning and continuous education. So
they can be trained for the jobs that are and will be and not just the jobs that once
were.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 21Satya Nadella
Brad SmithSo how can we expand the LinkedIn footprint here? Through our acquisition of
Lynda, we picked up a world-class entity and the creation of course work that we
believe could transform learning development. Now imagine that course work
deeply integrated throughout Microsoft's ecosystem and one example, speciﬁcally,
we're excited about is integrating learning alongside some of the most popular
productivity apps anywhere in the world, Excel, PowerPoint and Word.
Now visualize a new tab added to Oﬃce called Learning. And you will start to get a
sense of the power of this. The image that you're seeing there is something we're
really excited about. It's actually a new proprietary technology that is a contextual
overlay. So that when you are in these Microsoft products, you're going to be able to
see who you can tap within your network, within the entire broader ecosystem,
freelancers and the actual course work itself. I will leave you with this. Six of the top
25 courses on Lynda are related to Microsoft product. So excited about this
opportunity.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
That's great, Jeﬀ. Thank you. Hope that gives you a real feel for how, between
LinkedIn, Oﬃce 365 and Dynamics, we can create to a tremendous amount of value
for the customers of each of these products by doing these tasteful integrations that
bring together business process, productivity, collaboration and the professional
network and transform or reinvent productivity in business process.
But the value goes behind that. We, of course, are going to use the Microsoft ﬁeld
and distribution channels to scale the LinkedIn business, reach more audiences and
customers. We have a scaled cloud infrastructure; we fully expect LinkedIn to be able
to use that stack. Bing will have the best people search and professional search
capabilities; the LinkedIn feed inside of Windows done tastefully, will also improve
engagement. Then also for developers, there is a set of APIs over at LinkedIn that we
will expose through Azure and our tools to drive even developer engagement. So
plenty of other opportunities as well.
So with that, what I want to do is, I want to really transition now to Brad to talk about
the regulatory approach as well as then later Amy to talk about the transaction
overview. So Brad, over to you.
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Thank you, Satya. A few words on the regulatory situation. First, as we noted in the
slides, we plan to obtain regulatory approval in the United States, the European
Union and Canada before we close the transaction. There will be a small number of
additional countries where we will need to obtain regulatory approval before
implementing the transaction in those particular countries. I did want to note that
we've concluded that regulatory approval is not going to be required in Japan,
South Korea or China.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 21Amy HoodThen second, as we noted in the slides we are conﬁdent about our prospects for
obtaining regulatory approval by the end of this calendar year. We are really
conﬁdent for three reasons. Number one, this merger is what antitrust lawyers would
term highly complementary. There's not any signiﬁcant overlap between the
products and services of the two companies, indeed, LinkedIn's strength, as you've
heard, is in its professional network. And related Talent and Marketing Solutions.
Microsoft is in their productivity software, cloud platform and the like.
Second, it's clear we have an opportunity at Microsoft to use our complementary
assets to expand LinkedIn's business. Third, there's a real opportunity, as you've
heard, to deliver strong beneﬁts to consumers. It really beneﬁts through innovation
and these new scenarios to the many hundreds of millions of people around the
world who can get more in their lives out of this work together. So that's how we see
that and let me pass this to Amy.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thanks, Brad. As you've heard from Satya and Jeﬀ, we're excited about the new
scenarios that are only possible as we connect the professional world. And we're
conﬁdent that our joint product and go-to-market opportunities accelerate long-
term growth in new, complementary addressable markets.
Let me ﬁrst speak to a few details of the transaction. Under the terms of the deﬁnitive
agreement, we've agreed to acquire LinkedIn for $196 per share in an all-cash
transaction. That is approximately $26 billion, inclusive of LinkedIn's net cash. The
transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both
Microsoft and LinkedIn. Reid Hoﬀman, the Chairman, Co-Founder and controlling
shareholder of LinkedIn, has stated he will vote all his shares in accordance with their
Board's recommendation.
We expect transaction to close by the end of the calendar year during the Second
Quarter of our FY17, subject to approval by LinkedIn's shareholders and the
satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
We will ﬁnance this transaction primarily through new debt issued prior to close,
which we intend to raise opportunistically during favorable market windows.
Our primary objective with the combination is to accelerate our topline growth
across LinkedIn's core business as well as Oﬃce 365 and Dynamics. Additionally, we
expect at least $150 million annually in cost synergies as we naturally combine two
public company entities. Near-term, in Microsoft's FY17 and 2018, we anticipate this
transaction will be slightly dilutive, about 1% to non-GAAP EPS, based on the
expected close date. By FY19 and less than two years after close, we spent this
transaction to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS. In this context, non-GAAP does include
stock-based compensation expense, consistent with Microsoft's reporting treatment.
But excludes the anticipated impact of purchase accounting adjustments as well as
integration and transaction-related expenses. We'll provide an update on the EPS
impact after the transaction closes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-13

Q - Brent ThillNow let me turn to the topic of capital allocation. We will continue with our
approach, which is to balance our high-priority investments to drive our long-term
growth and to meet our commitment to return cash to our shareholders. We will
continue our share repurchase plan and, today, reiterate our intention to complete
the current $40 billion authorization by the end of the calendar year on the same
timeframe as previously committed.
We currently plan our reporting results for LinkedIn, post-acquisition, in our
Productivity and Business Processes segment. Additionally, we will introduce relevant
key performance indicators nearer to the close, consistent with our treatment of
other businesses.
As both Satya and I have said consistently, we evaluate new markets and
opportunities through three lenses. First, we ask ourselves whether an opportunity
will expand our addressable market and does that TAM have structural tailwind?
Second, does this then align with our core business and overall sense of purpose
where we can take a leadership role? And ﬁnally, with our ownership, can we
generate meaningful revenue and proﬁt growth? The addition of LinkedIn to
Microsoft meets this high bar.
With that, let me turn it back to Satya.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thank you, Amy. Today's an exciting day. It is the bringing together of the world's
professional cloud and the world's professional network. Jeﬀ and I are looking
forward to what we can do together to make a bigger diﬀerence in the world
together for our customers. Now let's open it up for questions. Over to you, Chris.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, please
repeat your instructions.
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions)
Brent Thill, UBS.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Thanks. Satya, you've had a tougher track record in large M&A; why is this deal
diﬀerent? And for Jeﬀ, one of key concerns has been the growth rate of the company
ha been decelerating. Why are you conﬁdent in that re-acceleration?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 21A - Satya Nadella
A - Jeﬀ Weiner{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thanks, Brent. The way I think about M&A acquisitions, Brent, is those three
dimensions I talked about. What is the total addressable market opportunities? Any
deal helping us getting to new markets or more successfully operate within markets.
Second, is there secular tailwinds, both in terms of usage as well as technology?
Then third, is this something that's at the core of Microsoft? Is this something that we
can really bring together, both our structural position as well as what we focus our
best execution against? And when I look at it in that dimension, this really -- LinkedIn
acquisition checks all those boxes.
If you look at the combination of Oﬃce 365, LinkedIn and Dynamics, I mean, that's at
the core of who we are. And our move to the cloud, that's where we have our
momentum and then you combine it with another born-in-the-cloud asset which is a
network asset, because I really strongly believe that it's not just about software-as-a-
service but it's software-as-a-service coupled with the network which has multiple
sites that give you the best long-term monetization opportunities.
Look at even how we are talking about CRM; it's not just about CRM. But it's CRM
with social selling. It is not just about HCM; it is HCM with Talent Management
Solutions and Recruiting from LinkedIn. Those to me are the transformative things
that we can now do and that's what gives me the optimism.
The other thing that also we talked about and I've -- with Jeﬀ, is the structure.
Because, of course, we have learned from the past. I want us to have LinkedIn retain
its culture, its brand, the way they go about building this network and do that
independently while achieving the integrations for our customers and we can do
that. I mean, if you look at even all the scenarios Jeﬀ and I painted, the loosely
coupled integration. This is not about changing the core of LinkedIn; it's about
bringing the best of LinkedIn and the best of Microsoft and our executional
handicap on this is, in fact, a lot lower than any of the others that you have talked
about in the past. So let me turn it over to Jeﬀ for the other part.
{BIO 5642386 <GO>}
In terms of the growth prospects, I would think about it at least on two dimensions,
both of which we alluded to in the materials we presented. The ﬁrst is with regard to
the overall network and member experience and the second is with regard to the
customer experience and the business opportunity.
On the former, there's a meaningful opportunity for scale here by virtue of the
alignment. So you take our network, our 433 million members thus far today, about
100 million-plus monthly actives. And you seamlessly integrate throughout
Microsoft's global footprint of over a billion customers, a billion customers that
contextually are as relevant as it gets in terms of our addressable opportunity. And
you think about bringing that social layer, the power of connections, professional
identity, to speciﬁc properties, speciﬁc assets like Outlook, Calendar, Oﬃce,
Windows, Skype, Dynamics. And we are both very excited about where we can take
that part of the business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 21Q - Brent Thill
A - Chris Suh
Operator
Q - Zane Chrane
A - Satya NadellaSo that would be almost foundational in a sense because each time we more deeply
engage a member, we're in a position where we are going to have greater proﬁle
completeness, where there will be higher connection density, higher liquidity of
content within that member's feed, more top of the funnel action in terms of
premium subscriptions; more marketing solutions or ad sales inventory; more data
that can be targeted by the customers that are looking for it. So that's one
component of this.
The second component and dimension is on the customer front. I think Satya just did
a really nice job of talking through higher market, sell, learn, all of these
opportunities that we're already in but become much bigger and a higher
probability of success, given how deeply Microsoft is already present within our
customer base and their customer base. So we're not just expanding the footprint
there. We're going deeper into the workﬂow. That workﬂow is going to create more
value, potentially less churn. So those -- that would be a construct in terms of
thinking it through.

{BIO 18757161 <GO>}
Hello. This is Zane Chrane in for Mark. Thanks for taking my question. Just had a
question about your commercial cloud revenue guidance. You previously guided to
$20 billion annualized run rate by FY18. How does this acquisition impact the
guidance for the commercial cloud given that it integrates so closely with Dynamics
and Oﬃce 365?
And second question is, you've done a ton of work with machine learning and
predictive analytics. How do you see this helping to increase the value proposition or
willingness to pay both for Oﬃce customers (and as) LinkedIn, as you integrate those
three oﬀerings? Thank you.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
So let me take the second part and then I'll even ask Amy to talk about it and then
Jeﬀ to add, if needed. When I think about the opportunity, when it comes to
machine learning and analytics, it is tremendous opportunity for us. Think about the
org analytics that we have today inside of Oﬃce 365, it is one of the big
diﬀerentiators of what we call Oﬃce 365 E5. And this is about being able to take that
Microsoft Graph and then bring insights at the next level.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-13

Q - Heather Bellini
A - Jeﬀ WeinerNow you combine that with the professional graph. I mean, this is what Jeﬀ was
describing with all of the insights they have inside of this proprietary database,
called the LinkedIn Database. And the combination of the two can give a lot of data
and information and that's where we've -- some of our best machine learning and AI
work will happen.
The other piece that I'm very excited about is the newsfeed. I mean, I go every day to
LinkedIn newsfeed. It is already, really, a very relevant newsfeed because it knows my
proﬁle. It knows where I work, my organization, my industry. But just imagine now,
you take that and combine it with this additional vector such as my projects, my
calendar, all the people and companies I'm going to meet over the next month, now
that relevance problem, again, is where we are well-suited to solve that. That's
broader natural language understanding; it is about applying the machine learning
at scale and this is where I think that we can, in fact, drive that relevance and then the
ad targeting to the next level. So I'm very, very excited about the opportunity that on
analytics, business process and AI. So let me turn over the question on forecast --
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Let me take the question on $20 billion annual revenue run rate by FY18. That goal
for us did not contemplate this type or scale of M&A. So as I stated in April, we
remain on track and conﬁdent in our ability to meet that goal. And in fact, today, I'm
more conﬁdent because of the deep alignment into, really, what is the core strength
of this Company, which has been around for productivity and business process. So I
do think this should accelerate our momentum beyond what we've talked about as
our goal for FY18.
{BIO 18757161 <GO>}

Hi, great and I apologize because I was jumping on and oﬀ. Congratulations on the
announcement. Was wondering if you could share with us the enterprise sales
strategy that you had at LinkedIn, obviously, before this announcement? And if you
can talk a little bit about what -- if -- how you're going to leverage Microsoft's
Enterprise sales force in order to reach the maximum vision. I'm just wondering what
type of cross-pollinization we might be thinking about. Thank you.

OperatorYes. We have two primary channels. We have our ﬁeld sales force at LinkedIn and we
have online, or self-serve, which is going to maximize leverage. And we are always
trying to get at that leverage wherever possible. Some of these solutions really
require that kind of human interaction and that kind of support. So Talent Solutions,
within Talent Solutions, speciﬁcally our ﬂagship recruiter product, is the core of that
business.
We've got a strong enterprise sales footprint, 40,000 enterprise customers plus,
40,000-plus. And we are looking forward to potentially expanding the products in
their bag, that we can take to market. And Satya talked a little bit about human
capital management and that continuum, that goes beyond passive candidate
recruiting. It goes beyond active job searches and there's so much more we can be
doing there. And of course, learning and development has also been able to
leverage that sales footprint. And we're excited about the opportunity to expand
there as well.
We have an ad sales force that brings our Marketing Solutions to customers and
we're going to be in a position now where we can unlock additional inventory from
within Microsoft's ecosystem. Sponsored content is already our fastest-growing
business at scale. So there should be additional opportunities there.
And we've got Sales Navigator and of course, Microsoft has Dynamics. And we think
there's going to be signiﬁcant opportunities there to take that to the next level. In
terms of the proprietary solution it's possible through the combination of our
business intelligence tools and the data ﬂowing through LinkedIn and Dynamics as a
CRM capability and full-service solution.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
I'm very, very excited about the potential here of thinking of what Microsoft does
with Dynamics and Oﬃce 365 and our channels as fundamental accelerants to the
core sales motion that LinkedIn already has. So as we plan the integration, that's
clearly going to be one of the big dimensions where we can really drive a lot of
increased growth for both sides.

Thanks for taking my question and congratulations to everybody. Two questions.
One would be, are there any performance metrics that the deal is predicated on, in
terms of either engagement, usage growth, member growth, et cetera, prior to the
close? Then secondly, just as it relates to the member experience, is it expected that
the member experience is going to change materially in terms of who you could
allow into your network?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Let me start and then Jeﬀ, you should add and Amy, you can add as well. First of all,
the -- we will all -- we will have KPIs that we will talk about in terms of how we track
progress and mark progress once the deal is closed and that we get close to that, we
will talk more about that.
But one of the things that's very important to us is whether it be Oﬃce 365, whether
it's Dynamics or now LinkedIn, what's paramount is really usage and satisfaction. So
that's what's LinkedIn has had a culture of member ﬁrst and I talk about customer
ﬁrst and customer (obsession), when it comes to our products. We measure it by, as I
said, usage and satisfaction and engagement intensity. And that's what's going to be
driving our product agenda because monetization is naturally built into that intensity
of usage and that's how we will go.
So I don't expect anything to change per se. But things will get enhanced so there's
no new gates for memberships. If anything, we would want to say that more value to
being a LinkedIn member. There's more value to being an Oﬃce 365 customer and
more value to being a Dynamics customer; that's how I see it.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
To Mark, your speciﬁc questions on any issues prior to close in terms of KPIs that
Company has to meet. No. It's just based on the customer, the vote of shareholders
of LinkedIn as well as the customary closing conditions.
{BIO 1750332 <GO>}

Q - Kash RanganHi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the deal. I wanted to ask about the
diﬀerent analytic competencies between LinkedIn and Microsoft. Wondering what
your roadmap is for integrating some of the diﬀerent pieces across the portfolio?
And also just looking at the diﬀerent oﬀerings, how you're monetizing this. Do you
see the combination as a way to improve upselling or pricing, or really, just as a way
to reinforce the core value prop of the oﬀerings to both customer bases?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
I will start with the analytics piece. The core capability of being able to create value
or the graph comes from being able to do machine learning and AI at scale. That's
really what this next wave of technology innovation is about. But in order to be able
to do that, you need data and the LinkedIn represents that, when it comes to the
professional network, it's the leading professional network. Microsoft Graph, which is
the data under Microsoft 365 and Dynamics represents the other side of it.
And so your ability to add intelligence and insights and the ability for people to,
most importantly, take intelligent action gets very enhanced. And that's where we
will sell the solutions, whether it be org analytics, whether it be analytics around
recruiting, whether it be analytics around sales eﬃciency. Those are the things which
people want and we are really, really excited about driving that piece. And I forget
what's the second part of your question?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I think he was talking really about how to add economic value and what I would say,
Ed, is it really falls into two basic buckets. One, many of the analytic scenarios that
Satya and Jeﬀ walked through are net-new. That isn't about upselling, per se, in the
way we've historically talked about it. It is about adding new TAM and adding new
revenue and adding new subscription value.
Now, the second component, which we've talked about is some of the core -- some
of our core analytics value props that we have today in Oﬃce 365, in our highest
ARPU product, right? So this is also about our conﬁdence in terms of being able to
continue to raise the ARPU per seat and being able to upsell to E5 and continue to
add value both in this current skew in the market over time as well as going forward.
{BIO 5286879 <GO>}
Great, thank you.

Q - Kash Rangan
A - Amy HoodHi, thank you very much. I've always been dreaming of logging into my workspace
with a Facebook, LinkedIn type of a landing page and then doing (the work net
points). It looks like that vision might come true with this interesting combination.
Congrats to guys. I can envision that Oﬃce is going to look a whole lot diﬀerent in
the next one to two years.
The question for you is for the Microsoft side, what speciﬁc portions of the LinkedIn
product portfolio do you feel that you could get the most synergies through way of
easy wins, such as your distribution. And secondly, how worried should we be with
respect to security implications? LinkedIn operates more on a public basis whereas
Oﬃce 365 is more of a private network within the enterprise. As you bring these two
worlds together, how you going to be navigating through what information is
actually allowed to be exposed from public networks versus not and how that might
actually change your view of synergies longer-term? Thank you very much.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thanks, Kash. Overall, ﬁrst, let me address the second part. The key here is that we
keep these two worlds separated because there's public information, there's tenant
information which is the customer's own data. And nothing gets linked. Nothing gets
connected without customers opting in, without provisioning of IT principles around
it. So in other words, customers decide what to connect. And we believe customers
will connect these, because of the value it generates for them. But even when it
generates the value it's their data, it is their insights. So we are very, very clear. And
very, very principled about how we will approach security.
Now, the second thing is in terms of the value we create and what's the easy wins.
And I think, just take LinkedIn itself. I mean, the ﬁrst thing is the additional
distribution for LinkedIn with -- forgetting even any connections and integrations,
just making LinkedIn more naturally available, one click away from your contacts, one
click away in your e-mail, one click away in your browser, one click away in Cortana.
Those are all things that we immediately hope to do because when we think about
Windows and Oﬃce, that's where the world's professionals are. A billion-plus users
that are every day using these tools and so that's the most natural place.
Then we can go to that newsfeed piece that you are excited about, that I am excited
about. Even there, the ability for you to take your calendar information and share it
with your newsfeed and the newsfeed uses AI to make it more relevant. That's the
kind of things that we would see going on in the very beginning. So lots of good
quick wins, which we hope to get a fast start on and then as we do deeper
integration, customers will have more value but always, the customers that are in
control and that's going to be our core principle.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Very exciting. Thanks a lot.

{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Thanks, guys, for taking my question and congrats to both parties here. Satya, you've
talked a lot about, not just today. But previously on the Oﬃce graph and delve as
well as just Microsoft as a platform Company, especially when you look at Azure.
When you think about what LinkedIn brings to the table here and the potential of the
APIs, which there were some (changes to you) from LinkedIn last year but if you put
those together, those APIs together with APIs from Microsoft and at Azure, maybe
talk about the platform component of this, ISVs, third-party developers, even
Enterprise developers, et cetera? Thanks.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
I've always said that the most strategic Microsoft app API, even for Azure developers,
is the Microsoft Graph and now we have one more, which is LinkedIn Economic
Graph, because, really, the way to think about cloud platforms is these networks,
these information graphs that where you can expose them to developers.
Then also give them all the cloud infrastructure, that's when you can create higher
value, just being in any one part doesn't maximize the value. Whenever Amy and I
think about even our capital, we think about Azure, we think about the higher-level
services in our Enterprise Mobility Suite, our Oﬃce 365, Dynamics and now,
LinkedIn. That combination of these high-level services that also have APIs, along
with the infrastructure services, is what gives Microsoft Cloud the most unique
monetization capability and long-term return capability and that's essentially how we
will approach it

Q - Ross MacMillan
A - Satya NadellaHi, thanks. Amy, I'm wondering if you could talk about -- you've guided to ﬂat OpEx
and you've had a very tight control on OpEx. And I'm wondering if this at all changes
your philosophy around that with buying assets that are growing faster. Maybe you
need to invest more and then just generally the concept of buying innovation versus
investing in innovation, how you are thinking about the trade-oﬀ there as you have
that pretty controlled OpEx?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thanks, Walter. Let me ﬁrst start by saying, we've spent, really, the past two-and-a-
half years focused on moving, actually, our OpEx, from lower-growth areas to higher-
growth areas. We've done that consistently and that's resulted, as an output, in a
more controlled view on OpEx.
We have many high-growth areas that we have invested aggressively in, in the past
two years: Azure, Oﬃce 365, analytics, machine learning and you go down that list
and it is about pivoting the Company. So to me, LinkedIn is just another in a list of
organic or inorganic opportunities to pivot the structurally growing areas where we
have a structural competitive advantage. I feel very good about that but I don't view
it as any diﬀerent, very transparently, than the two years we've spent working hard
and all the employees at Microsoft have worked hard to change our trajectory on all
these things. So I don't view it as, frankly, any diﬀerent in terms of setting ourselves
up for long-term growth in the areas where we have very high-growth rates across
our commercial cloud, Bing. And other places.

Thank you, Walter. We will take the next question, please.
Ross MacMillan, RBC Capital Markets.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
Thanks so much and congratulations on the deal. Satya, Talent Solutions is about
two-thirds of LinkedIn and that's grown as an independent business. I'm just curious,
would it beneﬁt Microsoft to integrate that with Microsoft Human Capital
Management software oﬀering to truly leverage that within your customer base? And
if so, do you have those required pieces for that HCM software category? Thanks.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes, no we -- that's a very exciting opportunity for us. We have Dynamics today, that
obviously participates across CRM and ERP and HCM categories in a very light way, I
would say today. So to me being able to take what LinkedIn has done with the
Recruiter and Talent Management Solutions. And looking at what are the natural
ways to expand into Dynamics is going to be the next set of things that we will do.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-13

process applications, one of the key things is it's a lot of, what I would call,
extensions and customizations that get built. We have one of the richest tools chains
for that. When you look at Azure and PowerApps and Visual Studio, those are the
places where, whether you're extending, quite frankly, your SAP or Dynamics or any

growth piece for us which comes very naturally as we think about business process
meets LinkedIn.

Michael Turits, Raymond James.
{BIO 1720659 <GO>}
My congrats also and thanks very much. Amy, a quick question for you. If $150 million
gets you that 4 points, it looks like, of additional EBIT margin expansion over time,
what are your thoughts on how much -- what the operating margins could eventually
look like for LinkedIn? And when you think about those -- that expansion, how much
can you get out of putting their infrastructure onto the cloud platform and the
impact of maybe cutting back on some of that CapEx and associated depreciation?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thanks for the question. First, I should say, my focus, really, in this acquisition, as I
said my comments, is about ﬁrst and foremost, topline revenue growth and accretion
to our other businesses. That is the philosophy. It's the rationale for members and it's
the rationale for adding value to customers and ultimately, adding to proﬁt growth at
our bottom line.
In terms of assumptions on our operating margins, we've basically taken the
comments that they've made very publicly in terms of focusing on that improvement.
We've made some natural assumptions about combining two public company
entities. And I think in terms of making progress, I think our abilities which, really, Jeﬀ
covered really well in terms of leveraging our ales models and our -- Satya talked
about the Dynamics sales force, we will be able to make good, solid progress here.
But it will come with a combination of high expectations for revenue growth and
expansion and then the natural follow-on of scale to operating margins.
