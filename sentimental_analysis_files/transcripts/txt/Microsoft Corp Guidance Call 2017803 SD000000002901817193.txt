Welcome to the Microsoft's New Accounting Standards and Investor Metrics
Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being
recorded.
I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations.
Chris, please proceed.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Thanks, Rhea. Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for joining us on the call today.
With me today is Frank Brod, our Chief Accounting Oﬃcer; and John Seethoﬀ,
Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Today's call is being webcast live
and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in the live transmission, in the
transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the
transcript at the Microsoft Investor Relations website until August 3, 2018.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are
predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements
are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and
uncertainties. Actual results could materially diﬀer because of factors discussed in
today's conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q
and other reports and ﬁlings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do
not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-03

today's discussion. Additionally, you can also ﬁnd today's 8-K ﬁling and our restated
historical results on our website as well as our ﬁscal 2017 10-K, which was ﬁled
yesterday in the current revenue standard.
We will not be discussing any topics other than the new accounting standards on the
call today.
Moving to Slide three is our agenda slide. We're holding this call to aid investors in
understanding Microsoft's transition to the new accounting standards for revenue
and for leases. Today, we'll provide you an overview of the standards, describe the
impact to our reported ﬁnancial results and investor metrics and then close with a
discussion about FY '18. We should have some time for questions at the end.
Before I turn the call over to Frank, I'd like to clarify some of the terms that we'll use
in today's discussion. We will refer to the accounting standards that were applicable
throughout ﬁscal '17 as the current standard. And we'll refer to the newly adopted
accounting standards as the new standard 606 or 842.
To start us oﬀ, I'm going to turn the call over to Frank.
{BIO 3446588 <GO>}
Well thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. On July 1, 2017, we adopted 2 new
accounting standards that cover revenue recognition and lease accounting. We
chose to adopt the new standards early, primarily to simplify the communication of
our results by eliminating the need for non-GAAP revenue reporting.
We have also chosen to early adopt the new leasing standard in order to provide
one set of restated ﬁnancial statements to investors. We will report our results under
these new standards beginning with the First Quarter of our ﬁscal year '18.
Today, we'll walk you through the concepts of these new standards and discuss the
impacts to Microsoft ﬁnancial statements and metrics.
Starting with Slide #5, let's begin with the new revenue accounting standard or ASC
606. This is a global cross-industry standard with a principle-based framework.
Under this standard, companies recognize revenue when they have transferred
control of products and services and have no further obligations to customers. The
software industry is one of the most impacted industries due to the elimination of
speciﬁc rules governing revenue deferrals.
Under this new standard, software revenue is now recognized upfront. And revenue
related to the value of ongoing obligations, such as software updates, must be
estimated and deferred.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 14Moving on to Slide #6. Under the new revenue standard, recognition for many areas
of Microsoft's business remain unchanged. This includes revenue for cloud services,
hardware, enterprise services and advertising revenue. Also, our cost of revenue
does not change. And most importantly, there's no change in our relationship with
our customers, our sales practices, our customer billings or our cash ﬂow.
The most material change to our GAAP ﬁnancials is the move to upfront recognition
for Windows 10 OEM revenue. Since the launch of Windows 10 in July of 2015, we
have been providing non-GAAP measures to exclude the impact from Windows 10
OEM revenue deferrals from our results. Going forward, the new revenue standard
will enable us to eliminate that adjustment and report solely on a GAAP basis.
Another important change for our ﬁnancials is the shift to upfront revenue
recognition for the license component of our on-premises annuity contracts. This
shift in recognition impacts our commercial business.
There are other changes to revenue recognition under the new standard that are less
impactful at the all of company level but drive changes at the segment and investor
metric level. These include the change to primarily upfront revenue recognition for
Oﬃce consumer on-premises license revenue in Japan, nonvolume-based patent
licensing revenue and gaming content revenue, such as Halo 5. We'll discuss these
changes and their impact on our reporting in more detail later in the presentation.
In addition to the revenue changes, there are small changes to our expenses.
Operating expenses decreased slightly, primarily to reﬂect the deferral of sales
incentives over the life of a contract in the few instances where they were previously
recognized entirely in the ﬁrst year of the contract.
Other income increases slightly to reﬂect the impact of foreign exchange
remeasurement on an increased balance of receivables. And also, our historical tax
rate is higher under the new standard, driven by a diﬀerent geographic mix of our
recognized income.
As you will see in our restated ﬁnancials, we have elected to adopt this standard
using the full retrospective method, restating ﬁscal years 2017 and 2016 to provide
greater comparability for the readers of our ﬁnancial statements.
So starting with Slide #7, I will talk in more detail about the latest changes to revenue.
As I previously stated, the most material change to our GAAP ﬁnancials is a move to
upfront recognition of Windows 10 OEM revenue. On the left side of Slide 7, you can
see an example of this change.
Under the current standard, we provide investors non-GAAP measures that exclude
the impact from Windows 10 OEM revenue deferrals to aid in their understanding of
our performance. Under the new standard, we will no longer need to provide this
revenue adjustment. And we'll report revenue solely on a GAAP basis. And going
forward, 3% of the Windows 10 OEM revenue will be deferred in the More PersonalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 14Computing segment. This relates to our obligation to customers to deliver ongoing
security enhancements and the latest features and updates over the life of the
Windows 10 devices.
Importantly and as you can see in the example, there is no impact to customer billing
or cash ﬂow.
Now to Slide #8 to discuss another important change to our GAAP ﬁnancials,
recognition from a license component of our on-premises annuity contracts.
As a reminder, our on-premises annuity contracts are generally 3-year agreements
with annual billings. There is no change to those under 606 and as a result, no
changes to our commercial bookings or cash ﬂow.
These on-premises annuity contracts include 2 components, a software license
component and a Software Assurance component, which includes various beneﬁts,
such as support and rights to latest versions of the software.
Under the current standard, we recognize revenue for both components ratably over
the contract term. Under the new standard, recognition for the Software Assurance
component will remain ratable or revenue for the license component of these
contracts will be recognized upfront, reﬂecting the completion of the initial software
delivery to customers.
This change has 3 key impacts: ﬁrst, this change results in some revenue from a
license component being recognized ahead of customer invoicing, driving an
increase in accounts receivable; second, the upfront recognition of this license
component revenues drives higher volatility in quarterly revenue and changes the
seasonality patterns of our reported revenue within a given year; and third, revenue
from the license component that is recognized upfront is no longer recorded in
unearned revenue. We'll discuss these impacts in more detail later in the
presentation.
Let's move now to Slide #9. To aid in the understanding of the diﬀerences between
the current and the new revenue standards, we have provided bridges for ﬁscal year
'17 and ﬁscal year '16 revenue and ﬁscal year 17's unearned revenue. I'm going to
spend a little time walking through those views now.
We'll start with ﬁscal year '17 revenue. Beginning with the left bar, you'll see that our
ﬁscal year '17 GAAP revenue as reported under the current standard is $90 billion.
However, we provide non-GAAP measures to exclude the impact from Windows 10
OEM revenue deferrals. And so many analysts and investors are also familiar with the
ﬁscal year '17 non-GAAP revenue of $96.7 billion, which you will see on the third bar.
The next 2 bars represent the net impact of moving the license component of our
on-premises annuity contracts, Oﬃce consumer on-premises licenses in Japan,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 14nonvolume-based patent licensing contracts and some gaming content, such as
Halo 5, to upfront revenue recognition under the new standard.
Of these changes, the largest impact is in our commercial on-premises annuity
business. Under the current revenue standard, ﬁscal year '17 included recognition of
license component revenue from contracts signed in prior years. Under the new
revenue standard, all license component revenue from on-premises annuity
contracts signed prior to ﬁscal year '17 has been restated to prior years or to retained
earnings. This is represented by the ﬁrst gray bar.
Additionally, under the new standard, we will recognize revenue into ﬁscal year '17
for the license component of on-premises annuity contracts that were signed in ﬁscal
year '17. But would have previously been recognized in future years under the current
standard. This is represented by the second green bar. And as we previously
discussed, there's a 3% revenue deferral for Windows 10 OEM related to the value of
software updates represented by the second gray bar.
The net impact of these 3 amounts compared to our total revenue base is small,
roughly approximately $100 million decrease in ﬁscal year '17 revenue when
compared to non-GAAP revenue under the current standard.
And now to Slide #10. This slide shows the walk for ﬁscal year '16 revenue, which
includes the same drivers as the prior slide. Under the new standard, the net impact
for ﬁscal year '16 is a decrease to revenue of approximately $800 million versus non-
GAAP revenue under the current standard.
In comparing to the prior slide, you see there was less revenue restated to prior
periods in ﬁscal '17 than in ﬁscal year '16 as the mix of our cloud revenue increases
year-over-year and the revenue from the license component of our on-premises
annuity contracts decreases, reﬂecting the transition to the cloud.
And ﬁnally, on Slide 11, this third bridge walks between June 30, 2017, unearned
revenue balance under the current standard of $44.5 billion and the June 30, 2017,
unearned revenue balance under the new standard of $26.7 billion.
The ﬁrst 2 gray bars represent revenue restated to ﬁscal year '16 and '17 and retained
earnings that would have otherwise been recognized in future periods under the
current standard.
The most impactful change is Windows 10 OEM, the ﬁrst gray bar on the chart,
driving a $13.3 billion decrease. The second gray bar represents the license
component of on-premises annuity contracts that are no longer recorded to
unearned revenue as well as small amounts related to oﬀer consumer licenses in
Japan, patent licensing and gaming content.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 14Chris SuhAnd lastly, the green bar represents the increase in unearned revenue for the 3%
Windows 10 OEM deferral. The net impact of these changes is a $17.8 billion
decrease to the total unearned revenue balance. Again, this was restated to prior
periods and to retained earnings. Given these changes, on a go-forward basis,
unearned revenue growth should reﬂect the higher mix of Cloud and Software
Assurance revenue.
And now it's time to turn the call over to Chris so that he can further expand on the
impact the new revenue standard has on our ﬁnancial statements and investor
metrics.
I'll rejoin you later to discuss the new leasing accounting standard.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Thanks, Frank. Let's move to Slide 12. This slide provides an income summary view
for ﬁscal '16 and ﬁscal '17 of the changes Frank described. In the GAAP view on top,
the revenue change is primarily driven by the Windows 10 OEM revenue deferral,
which we had previously adjusted for in our non-GAAP reporting.
In the non-GAAP view, the new revenue standard's impact is relatively small. For
ﬁscal '16, the change is approximately $800 million or less than 1% lower. For ﬁscal
'17, the revenue impact is only about $100 million. These revenue changes are due to
the factors that Frank described in detail on Slides 9 and 10.
Turning to the rest of the P&L. There are no changes to COGS. So the revenue
diﬀerence is reﬂected in the gross margin line. Operating expenses decreased in
both ﬁscal years due to the deferral of sales incentives. These 2 factors resulted in an
operating income change of $700 million in ﬁscal '16 and no change in ﬁscal '17.
Finally, as Frank stated, our non-GAAP historical tax rate is slightly higher based on
the geographic mix of recognized income. As a result, EPS decreased by $0.11 in
ﬁscal '16 and $0.02 in ﬁscal '17. And again, these changes had no impact on cash
ﬂow, billings or bookings.
Moving to Slide 13. In this slide, we've added ﬁscal '17 growth rates under both the
current and new standard. Because the revenue restatement impact is larger in ﬁscal
'16 than in ﬁscal '17, the growth rates in ﬁscal '17 are revised higher due to that lower
revenue comparable.
Importantly, since the accounting treatment of our Cloud and Software Assurance
revenue does not change as the license component of our on-premises annuity
contracts decreases, over time, the growth rates between the current and new
standard should be identical.
Moving to Slide 14. This slide is a quarterly view of ﬁscal '17. While the full year is
minimally impacted, as Frank mentioned earlier, the new revenue standard results inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 14a more -- in more variability quarter-to-quarter and changes the seasonality pattern
of our reported revenue within a given year. Here, you can clearly see this impact.
Revenue has shifted from our ﬁrst, second and Third Quarters into our Fourth
Quarter. Our Fourth Quarter typically experiences the highest volume of on-
premises annuity contracts. And you can see that the Q4 impact is the largest
revenue dollar change under the new standard. The new seasonality pattern in ﬁscal
'17 is indicative of what we'd expect in ﬁscal '18 as well.
Now let's turn to our investor metrics. On Slide 16, we created this trended view to
highlight important characteristics of our commercial business and provide context
as we discuss the impact of 606 on our reporting segments and associated investor
metrics.
Billings is a useful view because it's the same under both the current and new
accounting standards. This slide shows our commercial billings mix at the company
level and then billings mix across 4 commercial product and service metrics.
Enterprise Services is included in the total Microsoft Commercial billings but not
shown separately because there is no license component for annuity contracts in
that business.
We've identiﬁed 3 types of billings: transactional, license components of on-
premises annuity contracts and Cloud and Software Assurance component of on-
premises annuity contracts. I want to highlight a couple of points from these charts.
First, our customers' digital transformation and continued adoption of cloud services
as well as healthy annuity mix has led to a higher billings mix of Cloud and Software
Assurance at the company level in ﬁscal '17. Second, we talk frequently about our
transactional business, which is most impacted by the cloud transition. But also more
variable depending on in-quarter sales. Under the new revenue standard, the license
component of our on-premises annuity contracts will exhibit similar characteristics.
Given increased customer preference for cloud services, both these billing types
declined at the total company level.
Now let's look at each of the product metrics. In the Oﬃce commercial product and
services, you can see clearly the more advanced stage of the transition to Oﬃce 365,
reﬂected in the changing mix of billings as we continue to shift customers to the
cloud and grow the installed base. Our Dynamics product and cloud services view
shows a similar trend, except that there's no transactional business. This chart shows
how the shift to Dynamics 365 has impacted the billings mix even in its early stage
cloud transition.
For our server products and cloud services billings, there's 2 things here I'd like to
highlight. First, the continued innovation across the intelligent cloud and intelligent
edge means that our on-premises server business and our Azure cloud both
contribute to billings growth. From a mix perspective, Azure billings growth has
been tremendous, far outpacing our on-premises growth, resulting in the mix you
see here. And second, because of this continued growth of on-premises annuityFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 14contract billings, we see the highest mix of billings that are impacted by in-quarter
sales and inherently, more variable quarter-to-quarter.
Finally, Windows commercial products and services. This view reﬂects healthy growth
across transactional, license component and Cloud and Software Assurance billings
in ﬁscal '17. As enterprise customers move to Windows 10, there is both installed base
growth and higher adoption of our security solutions, resulting in a slightly higher
transactional license component mix than the prior year.
Now let's go into the segment views. Starting with Slide 17. In our Productivity and
Business Processes segment, we have 3 impacted metrics. In the Oﬃce commercial
product and services KPI, as I just discussed, the Oﬃce 365 transition is our most
mature. The growth rate metric is about 1 point higher for the year, which reﬂects the
mix toward the faster-growing Oﬃce 365 business.
In Oﬃce consumer product and services, the change in growth rate is related to the
changes in revenue recognition in our consumer business -- Consumer Oﬃce
business in Japan that Frank referenced earlier, from ratable to upfront. As we've
discussed in prior calls, Japan is a large market for us, where Oﬃce has a high attach
to PCs. Accordingly, growth rates will be impacted by the performance of Japan's
consumer PC market.
I talked about Dynamics on the prior slide. We've seen strong adoption of Dynamics
365 since its release in 2016. I will reiterate that with this change to upfront
recognition, our Dynamics product and cloud services metric now reﬂects the early
stages of this cloud transition.
Moving to Slide 18, our Intelligent Cloud segment. I've talked about the billings trend
for the server product and cloud services metric already. But let me add some
additional context. This restated metric is higher by about 1 point for the full year. But
there is more variability quarter-to-quarter. The continued double-digit growth is
driven by robust Azure cloud revenue growth combined with growth in the license
revenue component of our on-premises annuity contracts as well. But as discussed
on Slide 16, the higher mix of transactional and on-premises license revenue when
compared to other businesses can result in more variability quarter-to-quarter.
Moving to Slide 19, our More Personal Computing segment. There are 4 metrics
impacted. In our OEM business, both Pro and non-Pro metrics are impacted by the
3% Windows deferral that Frank referenced earlier. In our Windows commercial
business, as customers upgrade to Windows 10 enterprise, the metric reﬂects growth
driven primarily by this license component revenue growth as our installed base
grows and customers increasingly adopt our security solutions.
And for ﬁscal '17, gaming revenue has a total impact of $24 million as previously
deferred gaming revenue, primarily Halo 5, is now recognized upfront under the
new standard.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 14Frank Henry BrodMoving to Slide 20, these are our commercial metrics. First, because there's no
change to commercial bookings, commercial billings and cash ﬂow with the new
revenue standard, those metrics remain unchanged.
Let's go to the impacted metric, commercial unearned revenue. Frank has walked
you through the mechanics of our unearned revenue changes under 606 on Slide 11.
With the license component of on-premises annuity contracts removed, the
commercial unearned revenue balances now more closely mirror the performance
of our Cloud and Software Assurance businesses.
Next, commercial revenue annuity mix. This metric has minimal change as there's no
change to the calculation methodology and no changes to customer contracts or
billings.
And in ﬁscal '18, we'll make a couple of changes to our commercial metrics. The ﬁrst
is we're adding commercial cloud quarterly revenue as a new KPI. We ﬁnished ﬁscal
'17 at nearly $15 billion. And we're committing to report this quarterly in ﬁscal '18.
This will take the place of the commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate metric,
which we'll report separately until we reach our $20 billion goal during ﬁscal '18.
And the last change is that we will retire the commercial contracted not billed metric.
With the new standard, it is less indicative of commercial bookings performance and
less helpful at calculating commercial bookings growth, which we provide to you
directly each quarter.
So on Slide 21, this is the complete view of our ﬁscal '18 investor metrics. We've kept
them largely unchanged, except for the 2 I just talked about. These metrics represent
important measures of business performance, further transparency into our cloud --
into our progress across our ambitions.
And ﬁnally, before I turn it over to Frank, Slide 22, on our cash ﬂows. Here, we
provided you a table of our operating and free cash ﬂow performance in ﬁscal '17.
Operating cash ﬂow, free cash ﬂow and their associated growth rates remain
unchanged under 606. Now I'll turn it back to Frank who will talk to you about the
new leasing accounting standard.
{BIO 3446588 <GO>}
Well thanks, Chris. And we'll turn our attention to Slide #24, where I'll brieﬂy discuss
the new leasing accounting standard. As we previously said, we're early adopting
this standard in conjunction with the new revenue standard and providing just one
set of restated ﬁnancial statements to reduce the impact on investors.
To enable this, we've implemented the KPMG leasing tool, which is hosted on Azure.
Under the lease accounting standard, there are no changes to our income
statement, to operating cash ﬂow or to free cash ﬂow, nor are there impacts of theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 14Chris Suhmethodology that we use to determine whether a lease is categorized as an
operating lease or a ﬁnancer capital lease.
There will also be no impact to our debt covenants. The new lease standard does
drive a change to the balance sheet as the operating leases will now be recorded
providing investors enhanced transparency around our lease-related assets and
liabilities. And for comparability, we've restated ﬁscal years 2017 and 2016.
On Slide 25, we have provided an example of the accounting for this new standard.
There you can see that we will now record our operating leases related to data
centers, oﬃces, research and development facilities, retail stores and various
equipment under the operating lease right-of-use assets, other current liabilities and
operating lease liability lines in the balance sheet.
This results in a net increase in assets and liabilities of $6.6 billion as of June 30, 2017.
And a net increase in assets and liabilities of $5.2 billion as of June 30, 2016.
And as I previously stated, this change will have no impact on our income statement
or cash ﬂows. The right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are shown on the
restated balance sheet included in the 8-K that we ﬁled today as well as on Slide 36
in the supplementary information provided later in this presentation.
And with that, Chris, I'll turn it back to you.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Thanks, Frank. Now I'll turn to the discussion on how the new revenue standard
impacts our Q1 and ﬁscal '18 guidance.
Let's go to Slide 27. Starting here with the Q1 guidance. We compared guidance
under the current standard and under the new revenue standard. Here, on the left,
you can see the exact guidance we provided on our July 20 earnings call.
On the right, you can see the corresponding translation of that guidance under 606.
This is a purely mechanical and direct translation of that guidance to the new
revenue standard, not an update on our business in any way.
Based on the changes we've walked you through, there are new revenue ranges for
our 3 reporting segments. In productivity and business processes, we expect
revenue under the new standard to be $7.85 billion to $8.05 billion, including
approximately $1.1 billion of LinkedIn revenue.
In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue under the new standard to be $6.55 billion
to $6.75 billion. And in more personal computing under the new standard, there is
no change to our revenue expectation of $8.6 billion to $8.9 billion.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-03

Q - Karl Emil Keirstead
A - Chris SuhThe new revenue standard does not change our expectations for foreign exchange
impact and the cost of revenue.
Finally, on this slide, I'd like to draw your attention to the revenue growth rates we've
provided for each segment. As you can see, the year-over-year growth rates are very
similar under either the current or the new standard.
Let's turn to Slide 28. Here, there's only one change. And that's in the commercial
unearned revenue, which is impacted by the changes previously discussed. We now
expect it to be $20.9 billion to $21.1 billion, in line with historical seasonality, which
remains the same under the new standard.
Turning to Slide 29 for our full year outlook. The new revenue standard does not
change our previous comments about ﬁscal '18, including our margin commentary.
As you prepare to update your models, a couple of points: ﬁrst, we do not believe
that the conversion from the current to the new accounting standard should prompt
you to change your full year estimates. So as you focus your work to adjusting the
quarters, please review the quarterly seasonality patterns, in particular, for ﬁscal '17 as
a helpful guide.
And with that, let's go to Q&A.
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with
Deutsche Bank.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Frank or Chris, it seems like one of the net eﬀects of these changes is to increase the
dependency on the Fourth Quarter, where that's going to have a higher sort of
seasonal impact. Now I'm sure inside Microsoft, you've got a pretty crack team that's
good at forecasting and setting guidance. But does the 4Q skew force you to
change anything internally in terms of your forecasting methodology or Chris, in the
way that you guide?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Karl, thanks for the question. First, I'll just remind you, there is no change. With the
new accounting standard, it really doesn't change anything in terms of how we
contract, how we invoice and how we engage with customers. So from that
standpoint, from a sales and go-to-market perspective, there is no real change at all
in terms of that engagement. So it really is a revenue recognition timing question.
And so from that perspective, again, with the new standard, because more revenue
will be reported -- because revenue for the license component of those on-prem
annuity contracts will be reported in the quarter that it's signed and that -- theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-03

A - Frank Henry Brodvolume of activity tends to be heavier in Q4, that's where the revenue will show up.
But the underlying mechanics, there's no change. And so there really is no diﬀerence
in -- from that point of view.
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
This has been very detailed and helpful presentation. I've got 2 quick questions. Just
to quickly conﬁrm, you're saying that we shouldn't really move around -- we
shouldn't change our numbers for total year revenue for FY '18. Rather, we should
move them around between the quarters. And that we should do it -- does that
mean it's in line with what we've seen in FY '16 and '17? Then a quick follow-up.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks, Mark. Thanks for the question. So to answer your question, as we said
on the call, the change in the accounting standard, we do not believe, should
prompt you to change your full year estimate. But the quarterly seasonality or the
spread across quarters does change. And FY '17 provides a pretty good road map
from our perspective on how that seasonality would look under the new standard.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Perfect. Very helpful. Second quick one, can you give us a sense of how large the
impact of spreading the sales commission is? And does that change as we go
forward for the growth in the subscription revenue going forward?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
On the -- just to clarify, Mark, you're referring to the sales commission expense
impact?
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
SG&A expenses in general. But sales commissions, right.
{BIO 3446588 <GO>}
Yes, Mark, we saw -- we're seeing a very small impact in the change of the standard
on sales expenses. They are -- because our sales incentives today generally align
with the way our revenue is brought in, there are some slight changes in there driven
by some speciﬁc programs where we pay incentives that have a beneﬁt for more
than one year. And if the incentives were previously paid for more than one year of a
contract, then we have to diﬀer those and take them over the life of the contract. But
most of the programs we have in Microsoft actually match to each year's revenue
billing. So there is not any (technical diﬃculty) so you'll see the numbers as you look
at the historical change as very modest.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-03

A - Chris SuhOur next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with Royal Bank of
Canada.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
Just one from me. When I look at the Q1 revised outlook, the More PC segment is the
same. But I would have thought because of the large deferral in Windows, that might
have had a bigger impact. Is there something that I'm just not connecting on there? I
would have thought that would have had an impact because of the Windows
deferral.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yes. So that's a good question, Ross. It's a good clariﬁer. Under the current standard,
we did defer Windows 10 revenue. But that did not get reﬂected in the More
Personal Computing segment, if you recall. The deferral ran through what we call
Corporate and Other. And so with the elimination of that non-GAAP adjustment, that
has no impact on the More Personal Computing segment. Now under the new
accounting standard, there is a new deferral that does hit that segment. But it's only
3% of the Windows 10 OEM revenue.
Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griﬃn Securities.
{BIO 1498201 <GO>}
Your change of guidance range for revenues for PBT and Intelligent Cloud were
$250 million and $350 million, respectively, which are very similar to the magnitudes
of the restatements for Q1 of '16 and Q1 of '17, according to the new table that you
provided. Would you expect therefore that the magnitudes of eﬀect for the
remainder of '18, second through Fourth Quarter, would be similar to the
restatement magnitudes that you show here on your table for second through Fourth
Quarters of '16 and 17?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Jay, thanks for the question. I think the best way to think about it. And as the
guidance that we gave on the call, was to look at ﬁscal '17 seasonality spread, which
we provided in the materials that we posted on our website, as a good road map for
how we think the seasonality in '18 will play itself out. And again, just importantly, that
in terms of the total year, the full year number is unchanged from your current
estimate from that point of view. But I do think the '17 seasonality would probably be
your best guidepost here. Okay, well, I think that wraps up the Q&A portion of
today's call. In closing, we hope you found this presentation helpful in
understanding the impact of the new revenue accounting standard and the new
leasing standard. And please contact us if you have any additional questions. Thank
you for joining.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-03
