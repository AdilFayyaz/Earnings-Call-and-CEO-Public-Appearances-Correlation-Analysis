Hi, this is Mike Halen, and welcome to the BI Webinar from Coronavirus to Hep A,
Restaurants Must Prepare to Minimize Risks. Quickly we'll go through some notes.
Today's presentation will be recorded and available for playback. You can ﬁnd the
replay link in the email that Bloomberg Webinar send you and access the replay that
way.
At the bottom of the slide window you can adjust the volume and maximize your
screen. Please ask questions. We want to make this as conversational as possible.
You can submit them to the right of the slides and we'll address questions after the
prepared statements.
And a copy of these slides will be distributed in a post event email. So quickly for
those of you who weren't familiar with Bloomberg Intelligence. We are Bloomberg's
internal research arm. We have almost 300 analysts covering about 2,000
companies. We also cover government, ESG, credit and litigation. And I'm very
excited to have Roslyn Stone with me.
She is the Chief Operating Oﬃcer of Zero Hour Health and Founder of Zedic. She is
going to give us some really good information on how restaurants should be dealing
with the threat of Coronavirus and other issues including Hepatitis A homelessness
and a few others. So quickly I'm just going to go through a few things from our
research side and as everybody here knows unless you've been living under a rock
that the market was down pretty signiﬁcantly last week. S&P was down about 12%.
A lot of this is around supply chain fears and consumer demand fears should the
Coronavirus spread in the United States. So we don't know too much about you
know what that impact is going to be just yet. And that's exactly why we have Roslyn
here, but what we have some information on is China. And so out of the companies
we cover.
We have a few that we feel that you should be aware of Yum China, Yum Brands their
parent and then Starbucks. So Yum China obviously has the most exposure. We think
they're very likely to post operating, an operating loss in 1Q and 2020 as well as the
outbreak leads to shrinking revenue and margins.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 2 of 19Roslyn StoneAs of February 5th the earnings call more than 30% of the stores were closed and
sales at open locations were down 40% to 50% since the Chinese New Year. Due to
limited store hours and much, much lower levels of consumer traﬃc. So we think
those numbers got worse in mid-February. They may be getting better now in March.
We have not received an update though in the last month. Sales de-leveraging
though will likely cause signiﬁcant margin contraction this year.
We do think KFC will fare better than Pizza Hut because they have a larger mix of to
go sales. And Yum China is a signiﬁcant portion. As you can see by the chart 18% of
Yum Brand store base right now. So it's going to have a signiﬁcant impact on the
franchise or same-store sales net unit growth and operating proﬁt will all likely fall
short of management's long-term targets. As China represented 28% of KFC's 2019
sales and 17% of Pizza Huts and made up a whopping 35% of Yum's net unit growth.
And then ﬁnally, Starbucks, we think they're going to likely to cut ﬁscal 2020 revenue
and operating income guidance as its quarantines and travel restrictions in China
have led to store closing, sales de-leveraging and store development delays. Almost
half of the stores were closed in January and we think that number likely rose in early
February as the travel restrictions increased.
We recently got an update. Last week management said 85% of stores are now
open. But even once people are allowed to move freely, we think they are going to
be hesitant to visit restaurants. This could have an outsized impact on Starbucks,
which serves high volumes of customers and act as a third place. Store staﬃng
should also be an issue.
So with that let's talk a little bit about the United States and I'm going to pass it over
to Roslyn.
Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone. I am from Zero Hour Health. Zero Hour
Health is almost 30-year old company. We support some of the biggest names in the
business for medical crisis prevention and response from large scale catering to
nationwide quick serve, we handle every kind of clinical issue that you can imagine
over the last almost 30 years.
A little bit of background about how we got into this business. Almost 30 years ago
we went into business to be the medical department for companies that did have
their own. And one of our very ﬁrst clients was Outback Steakhouse. And we went
into Outback when there's 40 restaurants and did ﬂu shots. And three years later
they went to write their ﬁrst crisis manual and came to us and said, hey what we'd
like to write in our crisis manual is that we'll call you when we have any kind of
employee health or patron health or community health issue and work together to
ﬁgure out how to resolve it.
Fast forward 25-plus years after that conversation and a couple of weeks ago our
staﬀ were part of a team. It's screened every food service worker before they went toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 19work at the Super Bowl. So over the years we've had lots and lots of issues come at
us and what I'm going to talk about today is how handling those issues and being
prepared for those issues is what's going to prepare you for handling Coronavirus.
Just a little bit about what we do with our health. We send real time alerts and we
make proactive recommendations which is what we're doing now providing medical
guidance and helping our clients develop or build out their crisis plans. When
something happens and we are starting to see some things happen related to
Coronavirus. We have 24/7 rapid response. We help determine whether or not the
illness is real and to this point for much of the restaurant industry it has not been real
although that seems to be changing over the last 24 hours and we have deep
relationships with health departments and other regulatory agencies.
So that when an issue comes up we can go right to the CDC or right to the State
Health Department. Our local health department and act as our clients, agents in
that situation but also partner with the Health Department, which we know is the best
way to resolve these situations.
When we do have a crisis situation we provide onsite and oﬀsite clinical support
expert knowledge and again we work with our clients who generally directly work
with local and national media as necessary, but giving restaurants good information
and the people that stand up to represent restaurants and food service providers
having good information is key to handling media related issues.
So what are the real issues that the health issues that the industry is facing. I want to
walk you through the issues that we dealt within 2019 because looking at how -- what
those issues are and how we handle them is what is going to best prepare us to
handle Coronavirus. We keep track of when our clients call us and what they call us
about and the list that you see in front of you is not necessarily in the frequency of
occurrence, but in the resources needed to respond.
Without a doubt Hepatitis A was the number one issue or resource drain in the
industry in 2019 and for our team. Just by way of history. In 2016, there were several
hundred Hepatitis A cases in the entire United States. In 2019 there were somewhere
north of 31,000. Let's talk about what happens to our restaurant when a single food
service worker is diagnosed with Hepatitis A.
Generally, in the past, the health department would go public and make a public
announcement that there was a food service worker who contracted Hepatitis A. And
just to put that in perspective there's only been a few cases of actual food service or
food-borne transmission of Hepatitis A. It can have that route of transmission.
But for the most part that's not how most transmission takes place. The Hepatitis A
problem is very, very closely aligned with the opioid problem. And but just to put it
in perspective and show you the impact on the industry. When a single Hepatitis A
case is made public by the Health Department. A restaurant will see a drop inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 19revenue of somewhere between 50% and 70%. We had one client who had Hepatitis
A case two weeks ago. The revenue in that restaurant is still down by almost 50%.
So we see a drop in revenue to somewhere between 50% and 70% of the pre-media
levels. Somewhere it stays down that low for at least three weeks usually six weeks
and then starts to come back where we get back above 80% at that location of the
pre-incident revenue. Even years later they may be at 80% or below the pre-incident
revenue. It will impact every restaurant with that name in the market. So if there are
four restaurants in one small city and they're all with one brand and one has a single
Hepatitis A Case where no guest and no coworkers got Hepatitis A. All the
restaurants in that market will see a revenue drop that will last signiﬁcant period of
time.
That single location will see the biggest drop in revenue and had been the slowest
to recover, but every restaurant in the market will experience it. The reason we're
talking about Hepatitis A today is not just for its ﬁnancial impact on the restaurant,
but to understand the way that we kept -- the things that we can do to prevent
Hepatitis A to prevent its transmission or to manage it when it occurs are the same
things that we need to do to prevent Coronavirus transmission.
The same thing is true for Norovirus. In the past 10 years, we've always had one or
two hepatitis cases per year among our client base. In the last year to two years
we've often had one or two per week and sometimes more than that, but Norovirus
has always made up more than half of the cases that we manage for our clients.
Norovirus as you know one single person vomiting in a restaurant or vomiting in a
bathroom can make hundreds of other people sick. Norovirus is a really diﬃcult virus
to manage unlike Coronavirus is a more diﬃcult virus to manage because while
there are certain things that are uncommon, but someone who has Norovirus is
shedding the virus at very, very high levels for 24 hours before they have symptoms
and then still shedding the virus at very high level for three days after their
symptoms end.
So the things that we've learned about managing Norovirus very much apply to
Coronavirus, which is not to work sick, not come back to work too soon and hand-
washing and good sanitizing practices are what contains both Hepatitis A and
Norovirus and we'll make sure that we don't get coworkers or guest sick when we
have someone who has been infected either an employee or a guest.
One of the things that's important to know about Coronavirus is it's a bit easier to kill
either Hepatitis A or Norovirus. It's encapsulated itself that reacts to almost a
response to almost any EPA approved sanitizer especially ones that say that they are
eﬀective for emerging viruses.
So again, what do we know about Hepatitis A and what do we know about
Norovirus. The things that work well to keep them out of restaurants will help keep
us safe for Coronavirus. Hand washing, not working sick, making sure that we identifyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 19who is stick and get them out of the restaurant that we as managers model not
working sick. Those are the two top issues that have impacted the industry and
impacted the industry from our ﬁnancial perspective from a employment perspective
and from a public relations perspective for the last several years.
Hepatitis A will continue to be a problem for us long after Coronavirus peaks and
starts to settle down because we really haven't done much about addressing
Hepatitis A in both the homeless community and the outweigh population which are
sometimes one in the same.
I want to mention measles because measles is an interesting -- an interesting health
issue that we dealt within 2019. Not one of our physicians had ever personally seen a
measles case before we got a call from a restaurant early last year saying that the
Health Department had notiﬁed them that an employee have been diagnosed with
measles because measles is a disease that was wiped out in this country through
proper vaccination years ago.
We learned a lot of important lessons from that very ﬁrst measles case. And since
then many of our clients have experienced either employees or guests with measles.
One of the things that we've learned is that the impact of a media statement is very,
very diﬀerent than Hep A or Norovirus. The public at this point is somewhat immune
to measles and not as afraid of it because so many of us have been vaccinated.
But the Health Department will always go public on a measles case whether it was a
guest or an employee who is diagnosed with measles in a restaurant, but the impact
is really interesting and sometimes disproportionate on restaurants and employee
population. The Health Department will come in and I want to see the vaccination
records for employees.
So in that very ﬁrst case we sort of listen to them. We sort of listen to them and let
them set the tone in the pace and they didn't seem terribly concerned, there was an
employee, there was an employee and it was clear from the press release that it was
an employee because when they listed the hours of exposure the person who is in
the restaurant for twofold days.
And then in other restaurants and schools and likewise for a couple of hours at a
time, but that's still going to impact the restaurant. What impacted the restaurant was
when on day four the Health Department asked to see all the vaccination records
and wanted to exclude anyone who's vaccination records hadn't yet been retrieved.
And that disproportionately aﬀected the back of the house. It's easier to open a
restaurant when you have to exclude the front of the house or certain members of
the front of the house, but when nearly the entire back of house is excluded because
they don't have their vaccination records. It's really hard to keep a restaurant open.
So we've learned a lot from measles and some of that applies to Hep A and some of
that applies to Norovirus which is to get the employee roster right away to startFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 19checking on vaccination records to send people to get measles titers right away and
the same thing with mumps, if we do ﬁnd that there is a case in the restaurant. I
would be remiss if I didn't talk about homeless for a minute. It was not an issue that
was ever on our top 10 list previously. It came up in 2019. I went to speak in front of a
client's franchise group in California several months ago and I stood up and started
to review the 2018 top 10 list when someone in the front of the room said, but I need
to talk about homelessness and often when I speak I may speak behind risk
management and in front of legal or something in that order.
So I try to defer the question to legal who is speaking after me, but this franchisee
was not accepting that because he really had issues as did everyone else in the room
by the time he got done asking his question. And his questions were, what do I do
about my bathroom, what do I do about keeping my bathrooms clean when there
are homeless people coming and using my bathrooms, so what do I do about my
salad bar, what do I do about concerns. We're ﬁnding needles, we're ﬁnding drugs,
we're having all kinds of issues related to the homeless community within our
restaurant community.
We had never in almost 30 years in business had the following question and then
had it in four consecutive months, which is what do we need to do if tear gas is used
in a bathroom and back story of that is that there are lots of times that someone has
been in the past couple of years either unconscious in a restaurant bathroom either
overdose during some way barricaded in a bathroom and the police had used tear
gas to get them out of the bathroom, which is the way that we prefer the biggest
amount of the bathroom other ways, but it does mean that our restaurant needs a
very, very thorough and proper cleaning.
We didn't know the answer to the question the ﬁrst time and found it and again had
the same question months and consecutive months. The rest of the illness on the list
are things of our top 10 list are things that many of you are familiar with and many of
you have dealt with before we always have some TB. It's endemic these days again a
disease that was wiped out in our lifetime.
Last year we had more recourse in previous years and certainly remain challenged
the industry. This year we had an uptick in guest complaints and an uptick in fake
guest complaints meaning we saw the same guest complaints from multiple
restaurants at the same set of medical bills repeatedly. We saw mumps for the ﬁrst
time. Cyclosporine another water issues were pretty, pretty widespread this past
year.
So now where are we? Now we have Coronavirus and what are the issues that you
guys are telling us that you're dealing with related to Coronavirus. Just a little bit of
back a little bit of wearing my epidemiology hack just to put Coronavirus in
perspective.
What we are hearing is that most people who get it are sick with something between
a mild cold or severe cold and a mild ﬂu. They are not particularly sick for very long ifFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 19they have no underlying medical conditions. Certainly the news in the last few days
had been coming at a fast and furious pace as well that information out there, and
this information out there and rumors out there. And here's what you have been
asking us about Coronavirus over the last few days. The very early on in the process
and have continued is some hesitation and serving Asian parties. And what we have
said repeatedly is there's absolutely no reason whatsoever not to serve or have any
hesitation or act any diﬀerently towards any group in the United States at this point
of time and again that question does keep coming up over and over and over again.
We're hearing from you that there is some concerns about students and employees
from Asia and Italy and what we trust is that the regulatory agencies are quarantining
people as appropriate who are returning from other countries. And again we're
trying very hard not to see any prejudicial treatment or any ways that want to put
employees treated from a diﬀerent group of employees.
We are seeing signiﬁcantly more illness or concerned about illness in Italy in the last
few days and it seems like there were quite a large number of high school winter
breaker or spring break trips that went to Italy that now returned. We did see a
situation yesterday where there was a school in Pawtucket, Rhode Island that was
closed after two or three students are either tested positive or are suspected of
having Coronavirus having returns from Italy. They chose to close the school and do
a voluntary quarantine of some of those families.
It did create a lot of misinformation and an opportunity for there to be some real
ﬁerce spread before we were able to get better information. We are seeing and
many of you have household contacts who are ill or being tested. We're having --
we're getting again a lot of misinformation about that. Just a few minutes ago we
had a situation where someone who said they were quarantine when it turned out
that their sisters roommate was being tested and there really was no quarantine. It
was a self quarantine or self determined quarantine and we've seen a lot of that over
the last few days.
Many of our clients have had sick calls where some says I think I have Coronavirus or
I have Coronavirus haven't been tested hasn't been out of the country, haven't had
other direct exposures. We're going to see some of that (inaudible) over time. It's
important to have the resources in place to evaluate that. Some of you have asked us
about taking temperatures and having managers do some kind of screening when
employees report to work and we don't want to see you put your managers in a
clinical role or to try to make a clinical evaluation. Problem with Coronavirus is that
roughly are upto 20% of people who are infected with Coronavirus are
asymptomatic.
So I'm not really sure what a restaurant manager as opposed to do in that situation
or how that would be eﬀective. And again put them in a really uncomfortable rule. I
think we need to leave the diagnostics role and the screening role to the regulatory
agencies, health departments and personal physicians and the like. We are not
advising that you send everyone to a doctor and there is some guidance from
coming down from the CDC that says that there will be a point that we will not beFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 19able or we should not require doctors notes because most people who have
Coronavirus will not need medical attention. They'll be sick, they'll get better and
we'll have some guidance for when it's okay to bring them back to work.
We had several clients who have sourcing challenges. There is an awful lot of
seafood that comes out of Southeast Asia and comes out of Asia and some concerns
about and some supply side issues, some delay issues some concerns about if they
use up their current supply now what the supply is going to look like going forward.
We are very interested to hear from you, what you're hearing about that and we're
also interested and what kind of creative solutions you'd have to some of those
sourcing issues and challenges.
The biggest set of questions that we have had over the last 48 hours are about
travel, travel issues and travel concerns. We are aware of several restaurant and food
service organizations and hospitality organizations that have canceled the annual
conferences that have encouraged people or put a hold on domestic travel.
We at Zero Hour Health are not currently doing that. That is not the guidance of our
health departments or on the CDC. Obviously that may change at some point in
time. What we're hearing again are concerns about employees not wanting to travel
who need to travel as part of their job.
We're hearing concerns about travel, domestic travel and travel policies. We're
hearing concerns about conferences coming up and then being canceled, people
that have spent a lot of money. Scheduling large groups of people to go to some
industry conferences that are coming up and what that's going to look like.
I think we're going to need to. We're going to need to have a wait and see attitude
about that and we're going to need to be ﬂexible on that. Again at this point in time,
we are limiting domestic travel. We certainly have some concerns about certain
international travel. We know that there were some new stories out there that are
accurate about very big companies having put a hold on all international travel and
all domestic travel.
Again at this point in time we don't have guidance that's telling us that's an
unnecessary course of action at this point in time. We did have some questions
come up yesterday about when an individual has personal concerns about traveling
and our best advice to you on that is to handle on a case-by-case basis. For our
clients, we can help you with that.
But if someone has a personal medical concern they should be able to discuss it
privately with the manager and address it in that way. So the question that you've all
had is from an employee cannot wear a mask and there is just in a straightforward
answer across the industry, which is that no one -- no employer out there is
comfortable in a restaurant retail or hospitality setting with employees either front or
back of the house wearing a mask.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 19There is no clinical reason to support wearing a mask at this time. There is a mask
shortage. As I'm sure many of you've heard and N95 respirator shortage. Our
guidance is that there is not a reason to wear a mask at this point. There is no clinical
direction to wear a mask and again our clients uniformly are saying no if you feel that
you need to wear a mask then unfortunately you can't come to work at this time.
Obviously some of these things may change over time, but that's where we are now.
I don't think there's anyone out there who wants a server wearing a mask serving
their dinner or seeing other ways that we're seeing issues that Coronavirus brought
into a restaurant unnecessarily at this point.
Someone asked a really good question yesterday afternoon and it was about
television and it was about where we get our news and how much news there is out
there and how uncomfortable our guests are with the whole Coronavirus issue.
And one of our clients yesterday talked about being sure that they were no longer
allowing their TV used to be tuned to news and their bars, but choosing sports or
food network or something else because there were some pretty uncomfortable
conversations going on.
And you could see peoples anxiety levels rising as there was so much news. And
what's on the news isn't always true there was a new store yesterday morning here in
New York with a physician being interviewed that really had incorrect information
about testing and who is being tested and when they should be tested again it was
on a major news network.
So we certainly want to make sure that we're handling those carefully. We are having
conversations about potential regional quarantines or closures. Our advice to you
there is, it's time to take out your crisis plans, your pandemic ﬂu plans that you
developed back in 2009 and also your hurricane plans and added them and bring
them up-to-date.
We think the closures if they occur will look more like a hurricane than anything else.
And I say that because in a hurricane you can carefully close down a restaurant in an
organized way that makes it easier to reopen. So we are getting rid of your -- you're
getting rid of your non-dry goods or your non-freezer goods either by hurricane you
would cook them up and give them to your employees to take-home, but now you
can just give them to your employees to take homes and their food if you're in a area
that we'd have a closure or original quarantine.
We are hearing some information about some restaurants thinking there maybe a
point that people are coming to their dining rooms or that if there were some kind of
warning about the public not staying at home or not going to public places that we
expect to see a signiﬁcant uptick in delivery and takeout and some hands oﬀ
procedures for doing delivery and take out where you're not coming face-to-face
with the guest picking it up and then last but not least, the question I personally get
the most is what is my personal preparedness plan.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03

we're certainly not being peppers that would be on one of the television shows but
we've stocked up on some groceries and the medications that we like when we're
not feeling well and do you think that guidance from the CDC was although created
some level of panic was probably appropriate at this point in time.
So what should we be doing? What we can actually do to keep ourselves safe or the
things that we tell all of you every day which is hand washing prevents cold, ﬂu, Hep
A, Norovirus and the spread of Coronavirus and cover your mouth when you cough.
Do not work sick. Don't let anyone work sick. Don't come to work unless you're fever
free for 24 hours and you can control your cough.
If you had vomiting and diarrhea, you need to be out for 48 hours before working.
Bathroom cleanliness is more important than ever. Focus on the touch points toilet
stall, sink and bathroom door handles and also the things at working at home. So all
your hand washing sinks.
And did I say hand washing I know many of you have heard me speak before and I
never stand up before any of you without talking about hand washing at the start of
what I say and the end. And this is truly a case where it is our ﬁrst defense, our best
defense or less defense and may be our only defense when soap and water is
available that's always preferable.
Some of you are using soap and water and then following with hand sanitizer and
then having hand sanitizers available for in between hand washing. If you have
questions and you want to reach us we're at zerohourhealth.com. We are at an
interesting point here at Zero Hour Health because this week we are launching a new

Questions And Answers
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yes, that was great. Thank you, Roslyn. Yes so please drop in some additional
questions if you have them. I'm going to monopolize Roslyn for a few minutes here
because I have a bunch of question that I had kind of like some clarity on. I think it's
a very important point that you make that there's a lot of misinformation out there. I
get a lot of my news from Twitter and there is a lot of irresponsible tweeting going
on out there. So I guess if you can kind of let us know or maybe we should be
looking to get our Coronavirus news right now?
Sure. We are getting our Coronavirus news from some very speciﬁc sources. We're
getting it from the CDC. We're getting from the World Health Organization. There's
an excellent New York Times site that's been updated throughout the day. There isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03

A - Roslyn Stonean organization at Minnesota called CIDRAP. We read CIDRAP religiously. We are not
reading mainstream media. We are not getting our Coronavirus news from the Daily
Voice or the other local newspapers because the information really hasn't been --
has not been accurate up-to-date or well researched.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Okay, great. And I guess I'll start oﬀ a little bit of good news, right. I think it's great
news and it puts a lot of people's minds at ease by you telling us that Coronavirus
most people that can track Coronavirus will suﬀer between a severe cold and the
mouth ﬂu. I think that deﬁnitely put my mind at ease when we ﬁrst sat down and
spoke and it seems like we got some pretty good news out of South Korea right in
terms of mortality rates over the weekend. Can you kind of talk a little bit about
what's going on there with the testing and how things have kind of panned out?
Sure. South Korea has done a lot more testing than we've done to-date in the United
States. It sounds like our testing will increase dramatically over the next few days or
few weeks, but testing isn't really necessary because there again there is no speciﬁc
treatment and there is no vaccine and most people are just getting better, but South
Korea has done a very large number of tests over the last several weeks and it looks
like when we started out, we are looking at, look like a mortality rate of somewhere
around 2%.
It's now dropped down based on the real numbers of who's been aﬀected or
infected to be somewhere around 0.6%, 0.5% and dropping. We think it may hit
something like 0.2% which would be almost identical to seasonal ﬂu and again
disproportionately aﬀecting those who have who are elderly and have underlying
severe medical conditions.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yes, that's great news. And, I mean, there's been a lot of talk about this being a very
bad ﬂu season. Is there a chance that the Coronavirus has been here?
Yes. Very good question. We now believe that Coronavirus has been here for weeks.
We were not testing for it. So in the last couple of weeks particularly here in New
York, but in many states we've seen some of the highest levels of ﬂu reported since
we've been testing the ﬂu and we're seeing that for a couple reasons. One is that
more people are getting tested for the ﬂu.
The second is more people are going to the doctor because they're concerned
about Coronavirus. So there's been very widespread ﬂu over the last several weeks.
This is the second wave of ﬂu season, which is an unusual at all, but none of them
were being tested for Coronavirus.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03

to other years. So, yes, we think it's been here for a while and people may have had
both tested positive for the ﬂu and not tested for Coronavirus and congratulations
you are not giving it the easy way.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
No. I think that's great news though for a lot of people that reading the headlines
that are out there, right. So that's some good stuﬀ too. All right. So you gave some
really good color on the impact of when an incident goes public Hep A or measles
or whatever it might be. That was great information. Does the type of store impact
the timeline QSR versus CDR versus fast casual independent if it's a coﬀee shop. Is
there anything that maybe can help or hurt that timeline the impact of sales when an
incident happens?
Sure. What we see is most impactful is having a core group of loyal customers. And
then in any situation your loyal customers will come back ﬁrst or they'll come back
when they know that you're hurting. Years ago I was outside of restaurant that had a
Hep A case that was very, very public.
It was in a major media market and I watched four seniors kind of toddle by in front
of me on their walkers and they were having this conversation with Cummins [ph]
because we knew the weight would be shorter and I just love that -- love sitting there
and hearing that.
So we are ﬁnding that when you have loyal followers, they're going to come back
that they're going to come back sooner and the public is generally more forgiving
for certain things and in the past because there's so much more to come.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
And it seem like that was the case for Chipotle, right. I mean that was a very quick
turnaround compared to some other names in the past?
I don't have information on that.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yes, for sure, but in our experience we know that turnaround happened a lot faster
than say Jack in the Box now a couple of decades ago. And sourcing issues
obviously this has been a big concern. You mentioned that some restaurant groups
have modiﬁed promotions because of shrimp and that some are actually going to
South America, Brazil to source seafood, but you had also mentioned that there are
some issues down there?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03

A - Roslyn StoneSure. Well whenever we change to a new sourcing channel. We change sourcing
channel that we use for other goods, but not these. We see some things going on
that are new and there were things that there's levels of research and follow up that
need to happen to bring a new vendor online or new per day or a new channel.
We're hearing that there are some issues going on with regard to Brazilian beef. We
don't have detail on it. It's been a new story that's been reported for the last several
days. So that may impact sourcing and seafood from that region.
But I think again it's just another set of challenges that the industry is facing under
challenging time, but that were way more nimble than we used to be and where
there are restaurant rooms that had a year or two year lead time in their sourcing
that's getting shorter or have to be shorter in order to be as nimble as we need to be
these days.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
All right. You had mentioned you had some comments for Farm-to-table I thought
were interesting too, yes.
Thank you. Yes, I like to talk about Farm-to-table because in the past what I said and
many of you heard me say this that the shorter the road from the Farm-to-the-table
the shorter the road for food-borne illness. But in this case, we may be seeing
something very diﬀerent which is that the shorter the road from the Farm-to-the-
table, the more solid your supply line is and here we're taking food in a shorter
distance that we may see more secure supply lines then if we're bringing in foot
(inaudible) in the world.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yes. And we also spoken earlier about Pawtucket, Rhode Island and the school
quarantine, right. 500 kids and their families are being quarantine. So I guess if you
could talk a little bit more about how we should think about domestic travel. What
are you recommending to your clients in terms of plans for quarantine. I know you
touched on it a little bit if you could expand on that, that would be great?
Sure. Again, I think, that we're going to see some natural curbing oﬀ of domestic
travel. Personally I travel a lot and not travel quite as much right now because we're
still busy with so many of these things and enjoying a little bit of a spike, but I don't
think that we're, I think, we're seeing things all over the place with what companies
are doing, but there is -- there are some uniform messaging, business travel should
be for a business necessity and that every company make their own decision.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03

A - Roslyn StoneI do think that we need to look at quarantines carefully and story went out earlier this
afternoon about a school that was closed for quarantine in Westchester County, New
York that was just. First of all the information that went out was wrong about which --
that it was entire school district when in fact it was a single private school and that
the private school was closed without any direction from a regulatory agency or
health organization that with authority.
So I think that we're going to need to evaluate the information that we get back to
what's the source of information that we may see some regional quarantines like we
would expect in a ﬂu pandemic and we're going to be on the territory if that
happens but we'll ﬁgure it out.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yes. And can employer send home employees without paying them and getting
ﬁnes due to fair work week legislation?
I'm sorry.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
So I'm just wondering about you had mentioned that employers should send home
employees. So can you speak to maybe about the impact of fair work week and how
that kind of would impact?
Sure. I'm not an attorney. So I can't really comment on employment law. But I would
say that in the past our advice has always been and continues to be that no one
should work sick ever that you will -- we will ﬁgure that out that you should consult
with your HR department and your legal department, but that no one should work
sick if an employee calls out sick that they are encouraged to stay home until they're
better.
If an employee tells you they don't feel well during their shift that you send them
home. We'll work out all those other detail that's what we need to do to be safe and
we need to model that behavior ourselves and I've been as guilty as quarantining
myself at my oﬃce as the next time.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
So and you had mentioned that delivery could become more popular right and that
makes a whole lot of sense. So can you talk is the feasible option restaurants closing
their dining room, but still doing delivery and takeout?
I think that is a feasible option and I'm hearing discussions about that amongst a
number of the major restaurant groups. There were some restaurant groups that areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03

A - Michael Halennot doing delivery. And I think that they maybe in some ways adversely impacted
although they almost everyone is doing takeout.
What that will look like -- we don't quite know yet, but we're hearing a lot about
hands oﬀ pickup of or delivery of takeout meals and I think we may see more of
about and that may lead us towards addressing some of the food safety issues of
takeout and delivery that haven't been top of mind and been a concern for us
through our health.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yes, Yum China, they're doing, they're exchanging deliveries within a few feet of
each other.
Sure.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
And they're also taking the temperature of the person who prepare the food and
who is delivering the food and putting it on a, no, on outside of the package. So
these are all things that we could someday see here, right.
That'd be ﬁne if 20% of the people had no symptoms, but --
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
For sure and I guess one more for me and then we'll get to the audience questions.
But you talked a little bit about some studies on pulmonary care?
Yes, thank you. So there were some really interesting studies that came out in the last
few days that were incredibly encouraging which is that since the last pandemic ﬂu
scare of 2009 that pulmonary care, ICU care and ER care has dramatically improved.
The technology has improved, the way that the processes are managed have
improved even the oxygen generators. So that one of our biggest concerns has
been the capacity of the health care system to take care of a large group of people
who are very, very sick.
And the good news, the really good news is we are in a diﬀerent place than we were
10 years ago with these issues and that we are at the health care system much better
prepared to handle more people with severe pulmonary illness. So again that will
help us keep those mortality rates much lower.

A - Michael Halen
A - Roslyn StoneThat's great. So I guess let's get to some of these audience questions. The ﬁrst one is
what can we do today to ease the public scare of COVID-19?
Good question, big question. I think we need again to have good information
sources. I love the question we had yesterday about the televisions and restaurants.
We need to be sure that we're not feeding into the rumors that we're using that
information sources that we are leaders in our community on this that we're doing
the right thing. And that the rest I think will happen naturally. There should probably
be some level of healthy surrogate, but that most of us go about our business at this
point in time.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Okay, great. And how long before we see any ease on company's travel restrictions.
Will it get worse before it gets better?
I don't know the answer to that. The investing accordingly, I don't know the answer
to that question, and we've had a number of clients ask us if they thought they
should postpone conferences or postpone travel. I ask about travel, conferences at
the end of May or June and we really don't have an answer to that.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Okay. If we know that an employee has either been exposed or close to someone
that has been exposed to Coronavirus. Should we take them oﬀ the schedule or wait
until a direct notiﬁcation from the health department?
That's a tough question. At this point in time I do believe that we should be waiting
for direction from a health department because we're seeing a lot of information and
we're seeing a lot of misinformation, we're seeing a lot of rumors, we are seeing a lot
of people saying they were exposed to Coronavirus when they really weren't.
Again the one that we dealt with just a short time ago was when from the person
being tested for and having their family having Coronavirus too, a room-mate's
family being tested maybe. So I think that's a diﬃcult one and I think you're going to
need to take care, but on a case-by-case basis, I would not exclude employees who
might have been exposed. And I personally in my oﬃce would rely on
communication from a health department.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
That's great. Do you think restaurants should communicate about Coronavirus with
their dining?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03

A - Roslyn StoneGood question. I am not a restaurant communication person. However, I do think
that there are some very good restaurant communications people out there that
have more information about that. And it would be very interesting to hear what kind
of questions you guys are getting from your guests about that.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Okay. And one of our listeners have said that they've had many events canceled due
to the virus. Do you know if insurance companies are covering loss of business?
A question for you?
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Unfortunately, I do not have an answer on that one.
I do ﬁnd out that most travel insurance doesn't cover calculations for active guard or
for pandemic?
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yes, well, I do -- I did have a discussion with one of our insurance analysts, and it
looks like most of that -- this is an incident and active guard that would not be
covered under most insurance agreements. Any guidance on whether restaurant
should grant paid time oﬀ to hourly workers in this instance since many restaurants
don't oﬀer it?
That's a diﬃcult question for me to answer and a question that just so dramatically
impacts the entire industry. I think that's a separate not a separate issue, but an issue
that needs a lot further discussion. And in this case could be a very, very expensive
discussion because we're not talking about putting somebody out for three days,
because we think that Norovirus we're talking about people being out for several
weeks and it's going to need more discussion and research and certainly with very,
very heavily impacted ﬁnancial viability of many mutations.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yes, it would be a great thing to be able to oﬀer, but a lot of restaurants are in a mid
single-digit net margin businesses. It's just diﬃcult to be able to pay employees that
aren't working. If a company implements a wellness check for every shift that they
are open, not just, does that because of COVID-19. Is it okay to have a temperature
check as part of the wellness check?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03

A - Roslyn StoneWe do not think they should. We don't want to see you have a manager be in a
situation of being asked to have clinical skills or to use a set of clinical judgements
that they are not trained for. Again there are a lot of people with COVID-19 who have
no fever.
There are a lot of people with COVID-19 who have no symptoms at all. There are
people with Norovirus with guaranteed symptoms. There are people with Norovirus
with a fever. So again we don't really want to see a shift manager in a restaurant
being asked to make that kind of clinical judgement. I think that's a really

{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yes. And what's the -- what's the I guess the timeline of being able to spread it with
your asymptomatic? I mean can you still shut it?
We don't know that yet. There were many more things about Coronavirus or COVID-
19 that we don't know than we do know. And I don't think we have some -- I don't
think we have clear information. I think there's probably some real good information
or newer information from the CDC about that than we have right this minute.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yes. Has anyone asked about handling currency and are there risk associated with
that?
I believe the answer to that. Yes, we have been asked that question. That's a question
that's comes up a lot as we discuss food safety and good practice. And we believe
that people handling money should be wearing gloves and they should not be
handling food at the same time.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yes, that's sure. And no customers really don't like it. Do you know how often the
CDC is updating the website with relevant information?
I don't but I do know that they are listening. So I'll look at my phone in a minute and
throw you a big question to that question.

sessions be given to reinforce the messages today?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-03

Page 19 of 19A - Michael Halen
A - Roslyn StoneVery good question. At Zero Hour Health we have started sending a daily executive
summary to the senior leadership of our client base. Right now this is moving so
quickly that I do think that there are some good reasons for daily updates to senior
leadership. I think we're going to have to play it by year on how frequently we
update ﬁeld leadership.
And I know there are some organization that haven't passed this down to the ﬁeld
level. And in a last couple of days we've -- I've been asked to jump in as there was
really high level or anxieties in some ﬁeld management particularly because ﬁeld
management often have to move between restaurants. So they are either traveling
by car, by mass transportation, by plane between their restaurants.
So I do think there is a need for some regular communication with the ﬁeld. I don't
know that it needs to be on a daily basis like we are doing for executive leadership.
It's an important question.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Great, thanks. And that's it for our question. So I just I want to thank you again, Roslyn
for joining us. That was great. I feel a little bit better about Coronavirus after
speaking with you over the last couple of weeks and hopefully our listeners do too.
And they got some good information about their businesses. If you have any
questions feel free to reach out to me or Roslyn at Zero Hour Health. And we'll be
sure to forward along replay links and transcripts of the webinar. Thanks for joining
us.
