{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
So welcome, everybody. My name is Raji Gill from Needham & Company.
We're very pleased to have NVIDIA presenting with us at our Fourth Annual
Automotive Tech Conference. With us is Danny Shapiro. He's the Senior Director of
the Automotive Division at NVIDIA; as well as Stewart Stecker, Director of Investor
Relations.
Danny is the Senior Director of Automotive Division at NVIDIA. He's a 25-year
veteran of the computer graphics and semiconductor industries and has been with
NVIDIA since 2009.
So it's great to get his expertise and insight.
The format of the presentation will be about 20 to 25 minutes or 30 minutes on
NVIDIA side, and then we'll open it up to questions, 10 to 15 minutes. I'll kick it oﬀ.
(Operator Instructions)
So with that, let me hand it over to Danny.
{BIO 16651500 <GO>}
Great. Thanks so much. And it's really a pleasure to be with you today. What I wanted
to do is spend a little bit of time and just give you some insight into the work that
NVIDIA is doing in the automotive industry. And again, everything here is subject to
our usual ﬁnancial disclosures about forward-looking statements.
So NVIDIA, of course started out as a gaming company, and that's still a very big part
of what we do, and there's great growth there.
But as you know, AI is transforming every industry. And NVIDIA is sort of at the heart
of that AI revolution. There's really two aspects to AI. There's ﬁrst, the developmentFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 2 of 17of the AI, the training, and we play a very active role in that, and our data center
business is innovating in that space. And we just had new announcements with our
new Ampere architecture, and data center growth is enormous.
But then there's also the aspect of what we call edge AI or also inference where
sensors are taking data in and the AI has to understand the environment, and it's a
continuous cycle of reasoning and acting and planning.
In the automotive space, we have solutions that are designed to enable autonomous
vehicles and creating the brain of the AI system. And so our DGX systems are used in
the data center, and it's the exact same architecture then that goes in the vehicle in a
platform speciﬁc of what we call NVIDIA DRIVE AGX, our autonomous processing
platform for vehicles and robots and even health care. And so again, we have a full
end-to-end system that we've developed to enable everything to ultimately be
autonomous.
We believe this will be the case. Varying levels of automation and autonomy will be
across cars and trucks and all kinds of robots and delivery vehicles and fast
transportation as well as specialty vehicles.
So agriculture and mining as well.
The key thing here that we developed is not just about a part that goes in the car, but
it's a full end-to-end platform. It starts with data collection, so whether it's NVIDIA or
our customers, they are out there with human-driven vehicles and as well as
automated vehicles that have sensors on them that are collecting data. It's used for
mapping. It's used for training.
There's a massive amount of information that needs to come in for us to then be
able to train on how to recognize lane lines, recognize pedestrians, recognize street
signs. It all comes down to many diﬀerent neural nets that are running in the vehicle,
and each of those neural nets is very compute-intensive and needs to be trained on
a massive amount of data and continually reﬁned and updated.
Before we actually put it on the road, though, we want to test and validate. And this
is where simulation plays a very large role.
So we've developed our Constellation platform that allows us to do full hardware in
the loop and software in the loop testing and validation before it actually goes on
the road. And then we have our platform for inside the vehicle. Again, this is the
DRIVE platform that is running diﬀerent software stacks.
We have our DRIVE AV, which is the autonomous vehicle stack, that's doing all the
sensing, perception, mapping, localization and path planning. And then our DRIVE IX
software stack, which is our intelligent experience, which will leverage sensors inside
the vehicle, maybe a driver or passenger-facing cameras to do driver monitoring,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 17detecting someone is drowsy or distracted. And with that, we'll integrate with the
outside sensors to enable new safety features or convenience features.
So again, this is the industry's only platform that goes from end to end, a single
architecture that the software that's been developed and trained on NVIDIA is then
running on NVIDIA inside the vehicle.
As I mentioned, then there's a variety of diﬀerent deep neural networks that need to
be running inside the card.
So we've developed dozens of these that we make available to our customers, and
our platform is open, so they can build their software on top.
So these diﬀerent neural networks are taking the camera or the radar, the LiDAR, the
ultrasonic data and are trained to detect objects or to then also understand what's
free space, which is basically the opposite of detecting objects and where is it safe to
drive.
We can then run algorithms on these to understand the distance to detect diﬀerent
weather conditions, diﬀerent road congestions.
We can do map localization with cameras with LiDAR. We can plan pads.
We can anticipate trajectories of other vehicles. The list goes on and on. And this is
really where the crux of the challenges that we're developing software. Our partners
are developing software because we want to be able to ensure that these vehicles
are safe on the road.
So again, a diversity of diﬀerent kind of algorithms and redundancy is key to insure
safety.
To that end, again, we want to be able to test and validate everything, and so we've
developed our DRIVE Constellation. This is a two-server unit. One server is
generating the environments in virtual reality. It's generating the synthetic sensor
data based on real-world experience. And so we're simulating all those sensors, and
then we're feeding that into the second server, which is the DRIVE AGX computer.
It's operating the full software stack as if it was driving on the road, but it's in a virtual
or simulated environment. And then the commands for driving, the steering,
acceleration, breaking are sent back to the simulator. And we're able to do this 30x a
second.
So this is a full hardware in the loop simulation that lets us take a vehicle that might
only be operating a couple of hours a day and now operated in the cloud 24/7. And
so this is a way that we can then rack up all of these servers, and this will be a whole
ﬂeet of vehicles that, again, are not just driving on the roads where testing is
essential on the roads, of course.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 17But usually, those are boring tests, meaning nothing happens. A good thing, of
course.
But really, what we want to be able to do is test those really dangerous, challenging,
hazardous scenarios, and they often won't even occur after days and days or months
or years of testing.
And so in simulation, we can have these edge cases or corner cases, as they call it.
Kids running out in front of cars, people running red lights, blinding light at sunrise
or sunset. The kinds of things you don't encounter very often, we can put them in
simulation and test and test over and over. And so the ability to do this enables our
partner companies to test and validate and basically, recreate and run regression
over time to ensure that the software is catching all these corner cases.
The other thing, of course as part of our end-to-end solution is the software stack.
So we've developed a massive amount of software where the base platform that
goes in the car, software applications on top, tools, libraries, deep neural networks
and our customers that are able to build their applications.
So we have our DRIVE OS software as the core layer.
We have our DRIVE AV, our autonomous vehicle; and DRIVE IX, intelligent
experience, software stacks. And then there's all kinds of libraries in our DRIVE works
for the sensor processing for mapping and localization and path planning.
So this full software stack is open to our customers to build their applications on top.
Of course then is the hardware that it runs on. Our DRIVE platform is being used by
hundreds of companies from carmakers to truck makers to shuttle companies,
robotaxi companies. And it's a single architecture that scales. And each new
generation of our technology is backwards compatible.
So it's a seamless transition for the software.
We recently introduced NVIDIA Orin. It's our newest SoC or system on a chip. It's a 17
billion transistor chip. Inside, it has many diﬀerent processors. There's ARM CPUs.
There's a new Ampere GPU. There's programmable vision accelerators. There's
deep-learning accelerators. Again, this is a whole computer, a system on a chip
designed for autonomous vehicles.
So many diﬀerent types of algorithms are running simultaneously, providing diversity
and redundancy required for safe operation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 17It's a 7x performance boost over our previous generation. So again, we've been able
to make it more energy-eﬃcient and increase the performance dramatically.
Now with this new architecture, with our Ampere architecture, on the GPU side, it's
much more energy-eﬃcient. And now we're able to broaden our oﬀering. Again, the
key thing here, it's a single architecture. Our customers that we've been working with
on developing higher levels of automation, Level 2+ to Level 4 and Level 5 robotaxis
are asking us for help at that entry-level segment. Traditionally, they've been working
on a totally diﬀerent architecture, a diﬀerent vendor developing front-facing
cameras, and it really is too expensive in terms of dollars, in terms of manpower and
engineering.
So now with our new Orin and Ampere architecture, we can span the entire range
from the entry level, which is the simple ADAS solution, a single camera, front-facing
solution. A new Orin entry-level will operate at just ﬁve watts.
So energy sipping there, delivering 10 tops of performance.
So 10 trillion operations per second to be able to do front-facing ADAS solution,
basically a 5-star end-cap type of oﬀering but based on the same infrastructure
training for AI and software stack that will span all the way over to our new 2,000
tops performance at the high end for robotaxis.
So again, for the ﬁrst time, an automaker has a single architecture, a single software
development eﬀort. They can now put this solution in every single vehicle in their
lineup and leverage that uniﬁed engineering approach. And again, this is software-
updatable.
So over time, they can add new features, new capabilities. This opens up new
business models for these automakers as well. This is something that's really key and
a huge inﬂection point for the industry.
So at that entry level, again, a single scalable architecture but a small, front-facing
camera unit mounted in the windshield with our entry Orin, our ADAS solution, it has
the Ampere GPU, and it will deliver an incredible 10 trillion operations per second at
just ﬁve watts of power. And the other extreme, now we're combining two of the
high-end Orin SoCs, each of those able to deliver up to 200 tops with two new
Ampere GPUs.
So grand total of 2,000 tops able to run many diﬀerent applications simultaneously.
It delivers now 6x the performance of our current Pegasus oﬀering, which is what is
in development for many of the robotaxi companies. And again, greater
performance per watt.
So energy consumption has gone down dramatically.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 17What I want to do is show you a little video clip now. Over the bandwidth there, you
might not see full frame rate.
But this is a recent drive in one of our test vehicles.
We have a ﬂeet, a small ﬂeet compared to our customers, but we need to
understand the complexity and the full challenge ahead of our customers, and also
then, we're able to develop our hardware and software by understanding the full
complexity of the problem.
So you can see this is our new headquarters called Endeavor. And I'm going to go
ahead and play this video. You can see one of our test vehicles on the road.
(Video Clip)
So again, then there's obviously a safety driver inside the vehicle. But it's doing all of
the sensor processing. There's a neural network for detecting lights, for detecting
lanes, for detecting other vehicles.
So the driver -- it doesn't touch the steering wheel. And he's there to take over if he
needs to, and the system is able to detect everything on the road.
So I'm not going to pay the full video. This goes on for several minutes, but we're
able to now be driving all around the roads of Silicon Valley as we do tests. Those
tests are currently on hold right now due to the COVID-19 situation.
But the beneﬁt that we have, again, in our whole end-to-end solution is that we've
shifted to doing all of our testing in simulation in the cloud.
And so I want to advance to the next clip, and this will show the same kinds of drives
but now fully in the simulator.
+++presentation
So leveraging the technology we have from a graphic standpoint as well as
modeling the physics, physical dynamics. And now all the sensor processing were
taking simulated inputs into our software we're running, and we're doing all the
same kinds of detections on the simulated data and can test and validate that the
complete system actually works before it goes on the road. And so our engineers are
at home working and being extremely productive, even while in stay-at-home
orders.
So our ecosystem that's leveraging our technology is vast. There are hundreds of
companies that are building and testing and deploying their vehicles on NVIDIA
DRIVE. And so we've made announcements, of course with big OEMs like Mercedes-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 17Benz and Volvo, Toyota. In China, we have a number of automakers as well. The
trucking industry is doing a lot of development work. And in fact, during recent
pandemic months, right, we've seen a shift from there's less people out on the road.
This ride-sharing has gone down.
So the robotaxi business may look at risk. The reality is it's still very healthy long
term.
But we've seen a pull-in of delivery and trucking needs as well.
So a lot of long-haul trucking, a lot of last-mile delivery activity will be going
autonomous.
We work with hundreds of start-ups and software companies as well as the mapping
companies, the sensor companies, the simulation companies. It's a very complex
ecosystem. There's a lot of diﬀerent players, and they're all developing on the
NVIDIA DRIVE platform.
So why do people come to the NVIDIA DRIVE platform? I think there's several key
things I talked about. I just want to wrap up here before we go to questions, but
some of the key diﬀerentiators that we have. The ﬁrst, again, it's an end-to-end
platform. I think that term is used a lot.
But really, there's nobody else in the industry that has the complete breadth that
NVIDIA has that starts in the data center with the data coming in, the collection, the
archiving, the curating of that data, that's all on NVIDIA. Even our competition is
using NVIDIA in their data centers.
So the algorithms are developed on our architecture. There's the testing, validating
to simulation on the same architecture, and then it goes in the vehicle.
So it's seamless. There's no porting of code. It's really a huge advantage.
The other thing that is pretty unique to NVIDIA is, again, a single architecture in the
vehicle. It's not diﬀerent chips. It's not some CPUs or some diﬀerent GPUs or some
diﬀerent deep-learning accelerators. It's a single architecture that spans, again, now
from ADAS, a front-facing camera at ﬁve watts all the way up to our robotaxi solution.
Another key diﬀerentiator is it's open, right? We do not have a closed sort of black
box system, but our software platform is open for developers. They can take our
DRIVE OS. They can use our libraries. They can use our algorithms. Our DriveWorks
are DRIVE AV stack, and they can customize and build their own applications. This is
key -- and that no automaker wants to outsource their future, which is AV.
So again this open software-deﬁned, software-updatable architecture is key to the
future. Again, we have a vast ecosystem.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 17A - Rajvindra GillSo regardless of the kind of sensor they want to use, we work with the Tier 1
suppliers, of course.
We're not competing with them.
But it's a partnership between NVIDIA, the Tier 1 and the OEM to build these systems
to integrate diﬀerent maps because, of course you want to have a global vehicle that
can operate on any map.
So the China maps, of course are diﬀerent than Europe's maps. They're diﬀerent
from United States' maps.
But by having this vast ecosystem of sensors, maps, software, we can all then deliver
a global solution to our OEM customers.
So again, from end to end, single scalable and our vast ecosystem, we're seeing
great promise. It's a long-term play for us. There's ups and downs. It can be lumpy in
terms of the revenue stream.
But NVIDIA is committed. As Jensen has said, we're really excited about the
opportunities.
We have many recent design wins that we've announced and many more to come.
And with that, I'll open it up for questions.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
All right. Great. Let me just click on the video. Yes.
So yes, thank you, Danny, for that. That was very informative. Before we get into the
technology, I just want to get your thoughts on the market size and your design
pipeline.
So you have a single architecture. You have a very -- a breadth of solutions for
various products. Most of your engagements -- can you describe your
engagements? Have they been on Level 2+ or Level 3, Level 4? We know that Level
4, Level 5 has been pushed out further than what we initially thought because of
regulation and liability and uncertainty around the market.
So I wanted to kind of dig deeper in terms of your engagements for Level 2, Level
2+, which seemed to be what the market will be over the next 10 years and how your
solution, maybe it's more cost-eﬀective or has lower power than the competition?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 17A - Danny Shapiro
A - Rajvindra Gill
A - Kimberly Powell{BIO 16651500 <GO>}
Sure. So you're right. I mean we have a lot of diﬀerent engagements. There's a lot of
diﬀerent programs in play right now.
Some are going into production, right? We just announced with Xpeng, a Chinese
new energy vehicle. They've been taking orders on their P7 sedan, and it actually
starts deliveries this month. And so that's based on the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier.
So that's our current production part. That's what Toyota is using, Volvo is using. And
so those -- like you said -- will be kind of Level 2+ and in production starting now
over the next several years.
The beneﬁt, of course of this is it's all part of the same software-updatable
architecture. And so these cards get better and better over time.
We also, of course have a lot of robotaxi-type engagements. Companies like Zoox,
like Aurora and delivery.
So those potentially in large volumes are still years out, but that's really a great
development eﬀorts and is still ongoing.
We're not seeing any slowdown in that.
I think what we'll see now, of course is with our new ADAS oﬀering, you said, that's
right, that's where that volume number is, and those were -- we're going to be able
to start announcing those contracts soon, and then those will be several years to get
into production. And so what you see today is from a revenue split, we're kind of 50-
50 in terms of our legacy infotainment business and our AV development.
We've announced, of course that, that infotainment business will go down a bit in
the next quarter due to the overall state of the auto industry in terms of production,
things stopped or slowed and new consumer sales also taking a hit. And then, again,
in a few years, so we'll see, I think, a sizable ramp for AV.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
But would you agree that the market that's available to you or the industry is really
kind of Level 2 to Level 3 for the next 10 years or so or longer where we get to a
more autonomous vehicle kind of market? And if that is the case, then you -- there's
existing kind of competition there, and I'm just wondering how your solution will
kind of compete if it's not as advanced requirements that are needed in more Level
2, Level 3 -- versus Level 2, Level 3.
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
Sure.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 17A - Rajvindra Gill
A - Danny ShapiroWell I think what we will see is the deployment of higher-end system in more and
more vehicles, even if the software isn't activated. And so again, there's one
particular company out there in the market that's taken this approach. It has a very
high valuation because they're putting an AI computer in the car. They're putting
sensors all around the car. And even though it's not a Level 4 car today, it's selling
extremely well because it has the potential to get there as soon as the software and
the regulation is in place.
So I think other car companies need to adopt this strategy, and they are. And so
even if it's not shipping as a Level 4, it has the capability to be upgraded to a Level 4,
and that's really the strategy I see happening sooner rather than later.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
Can you discuss how your automotive SoCs, your DRIVE platform interacts with other
technologies and vehicles such as ADAS or the infotainment or the HMI? Particularly
around sensor fusion because that's where I think there's a lot of diﬀerentiation there
in terms of the vehicles are including more higher advanced sensors, a better
example will be LiDAR. And the processing is going to be oﬄoaded to your solution,
and that's where you can -- NVIDIA can really shine as it always does in that area.
{BIO 16651500 <GO>}
Again, it's a great question. I think what's key about our platform, again, it's open, it's
software-deﬁned. And so we're not locked into a speciﬁc camera or speciﬁc
algorithm because we've tuned the hardware.
We basically bake something in. It's an open platform.
So we have a vast array of diﬀerent cameras, diﬀerent sensors.
We're going from 1-megapixel cameras to two to 8 megapixels. And again, it's just a
software update to allow that ﬂexibility.
So whether it's diﬀerent sensors, again, we work closely with the Tier 1s to integrate
their sensors, to build the solution for their customers.
So whether it's diﬀerent maps, whether it's diﬀerent algorithms, that's the beauty of
the NVIDIA platform and the base we have on CUDA and now of our deep-learning
stack, we're able to change it over time, right, and with software updates, right, new
algorithms. There's going to be apps that come out a year or two from now that
haven't even been thought of today.
But because of the software-deﬁned nature of our platform, it's not a problem.
And the thing is, today, everyone has an iPhone, an Android phone. Could you
imagine buying a phone that doesn't get software updates? You wouldn't do it,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 11 of 17A - Rajvindra Gill
A - Danny Shapiro
A - Rajvindra Gillright? You're not going to have this ﬁxed function device. And virtually, every car on
the road today is like that old phone that you can't update.
So once consumers start to see what's available and get used to that, there's no way
that anyone is going to buy a non-software deﬁned vehicle in the future.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
In the past, in your Analyst Days, you've mentioned -- you've quantiﬁed the TAM for
your opportunity, roughly $25 billion. And you've kind of identiﬁed it $25 billion for
kind of driving Level 2, Level 3, 4 robotaxis, roughly $3 billion opportunity for
training and development and about $2 billion for validation. Just drilling on the
testing and validation, to me, that would seem the -- kind of the low-hanging fruit, as
these vehicles need to simulate autonomous scenarios, et cetera, versus driving 1
million miles around physically, manually.
So I'm curious to see what the uptake has been for your simulation products, your
training products on DGX. Are you seeing more from the ride-sharing, from the
OEMS? Describe that on your Constellation product platform.
{BIO 16651500 <GO>}
So again, you're right, Constellation is the simulation product. It's still in its early
days, right? We've basically been shipping that for maybe not even a year, right?
And it's a large development eﬀort. It's going well and we see that, again, as a great
growth opportunity for us. It's part of this end-to-end ﬂow and gives us the ability,
like you said, to test and validate, which is key, and it scales really nicely.
So we see it distributed over.
Some people are doing it on-prem, right? They're buying there, and they maintain
themselves. Others are working with cloud service providers, so they can buy time
on those simulators, and it's a good way for them to kind of start and scale up, but
we see a lot shifting to on-prem. And so we've already announced Toyota and Volvo
trucks as some of our big customers using us in the data center for training, for sim
and then deploying on the road.
But you're absolutely right, the -- again, if you're looking at this from a revenue
perspective, the timing data center is very big for automotive, and simulation is
growing. That gets reported in other parts of the company that doesn't ﬂow into that
auto number that is reported in our data center business.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
Right. And I think that's an interesting point.
So data center for automotive is kind of in data center in general, and so you're
seeing kind of an uptick based on what you're saying for simulation versus kind of
physical, manual –FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03

It's interesting. And again, even there are some companies that aren't using NVIDIA
in their vehicles, they're still very large customers of ours for data center.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely.
So are there any regulation hurdles? Have they been deﬁned yet to do simulation
versus actually manually driving and collecting data miles -- raw miles and the nano
taking bikes and whatever objects physically. Is there a regulation standard that's
been emerging? Or is it kind of well (inaudible)?
{BIO 16651500 <GO>}
We're very active in that with standard spot ties with SAE, with others that were
focused on ISO 26262. The key thing here has been engagement that we have with
the industry, with our partners.
We're working with NITSA.
We're working with the federal highway safety boards and the DoT. And so -- and
then also in other parts of the world, we're active. I think it's less about logging miles
and the disengagements but more about being able to look at scenarios. And so
what we're trying to do is come up with essentially an autonomous vehicle driver's
license. The vehicle has to sort of pass all these diﬀerent tests and all these diﬀerent
scenarios, and you can run this exhaustively in simulation. There's also obviously
going to be live on-road testing.
But I think we'll see a shift to a lot more virtual testing because, again, you're not
going to be able to eﬀectively test those really dangerous scenarios with a real
vehicle.
And another reason why the testing is so important is because even when we have
safety drivers in our cars or our partners, again, have safety drivers, those safety
drivers are there to make sure nothing bad happens.
So if there's a potential collision impending, that safety driver is going to take over as
soon as they feel uncomfortable. And that prevents the AV system from really
actually being put through its basis and test would the AV system actually prevent
this accident or not. And so again, in simulation, we can let it all play out. And if
something happens in sim, we just restart the simulation, and we update the
software.
We learned from that. You don't have that luxury in the real world if something bad
happens.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03

So just kind of shifting to the technology discussion, which we have about nine or 10
minutes.
So you have migrated your DRIVE platform to your new Ampere architecture, 7-
nanometer and for all your upcoming kind of Orin chips. What was the thinking
behind that? And is it to really provide this kind of end-to-end single architecture,
everything is on 7-nanometer now? And I'm just curious if you could elaborate
further on the migration to the Ampere architecture.
{BIO 16651500 <GO>}
Sure. Well again, as a company, we're constantly innovating, constantly moving
forward, right? I mean that's just the nature of the computing industry.
We're always pushing and developing and innovating. Having this single
architecture is key, though. It's not like the traditional auto industry where there was
something that was developed and it was kind of locked and loaded for ﬁve to
seven years, and something brand-new was developed and then you had to wait,
and we had this continuous ﬂow.
So starting with our early DRIVE PX and PX2 systems, people are developing
software and they could migrate them to our current architecture and then moving
forward to Orin.
So Orin will start sampling next year. And then all the development work today is still
happening on the current generation, but we're able to basically have this time
machine to accelerate the developments that when those chips go into production,
it's not like you have to wait where the software started development.
They're all developing today. And so again, we've seen the industry, in general, has
underestimated the complexity of this challenge, underestimated the amount of
compute required. And so we're constantly trying to deliver higher performance,
greater energy eﬃciency to the industry. And so it was a natural move, of course to
shift to Orin and Ampere.
Again, there's huge performance gains -- much more so than we've ever seen before
in the past in the computing industry.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
So you talked about kind of 4x the performance and power eﬃciency over your
Xavier solutions. I was wondering if you can go into some details and explain how
does Orin do this from a technological point of view. Is it primarily on the process
node migration? Is it more on the algorithm side?

A - Danny ShapiroIt's a combination of both, really. Yes. So the process node.
But again, we're able to -- I mean it is incredibly complex chips, 17 billion transistors.
But we've essentially built in diﬀerent parts of the chip to do diﬀerent types of
processing.
We have diﬀerent types of data coming in, and we have diﬀerent types of algorithms.
And some are serial, some are parallel, some are declining base.
So there's a lot of diﬀerent parts of the chip that are now tuned, and that gives us the
greater performance with consuming less energy.
We've -- as a company, we still call a GPU, right? We've had all these GPUs now.
These GPUs are doing diﬀerent kinds of processing than our gaming GPUs from a
decade ago. Still has that same name, but they are -- they're really custom ASICs, and
Xavier and Orin are designed as SoCs for AI challenges and speciﬁcally autonomous
vehicles.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
And when we look at the -- if we look at kind of on robotics, kind of shifting that and
kind of more on the robotaxis -- or I wouldn't say, robotaxi. Let's say trucking -- which
seems to be more of the immediate application for AVs.
In robotics, you stated that BMW has selected your Isaac robotics platform to
automate a lot of their factories. You're using logistic robots that are built on AI
computing individualization. How big -- what percentage of your kind of business,
automotive business, do you think that will be on the robotics side? Is this going to
be a meaningful kind of growth driver of robotics as well as on kind of on trucking
and transportation?
{BIO 16651500 <GO>}
Yes. I think robotics is really a diﬀerent segment from automotive. It's part of our
OEM business.
But I think there's great potential, right? I mean everything that moves will be
automated in some fashion.
So that's passenger vehicles, that's moving of goods, and I think we're going to see
a lot more, like you said, from the trucking and last-mile delivery before we're
moving people around.
But then there's also these -- whether they're ﬁxed robots and assembly lines, more
cobots, right? Instead of robots that have to basically shut down whenever a human
gets there or in manufacturing of these big changes around the robots, we're going
to see a lot more really smart robots that are able to sense their environments andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03

A - Danny Shapirobe able to work alongside with other humans as well as logistics, whether it's in
factories, warehouses. Even in health care, the market opportunity is very large there.
We see great growth potential.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
Great. And then just last question in terms of your product portfolio. You talked
about mounted in the windshield solution that's 10 trillion operations per second at
less than ﬁve watts all the way to robotaxis. What has been the feedback from the
OEMs? I understand the advantage of having a single architecture.
But are you getting any pushback in terms of being a sole supplier? Do they want
diversiﬁcation? Or is it really more ease of use and the ability to kind of update the
software as kind of the vehicle life cycle changes from ﬁve to seven years and more
to kind of a mobile phone life cycle where every six to nine months, it's going to be
updated?
There seems to be an underlying shift to that type of manufacturing cycle.
{BIO 16651500 <GO>}
For sure. Yes. This product expansion is a direct result of customer request, right? I
think you probably heard me or others saying that we're not going to go into that
commodity smart camera business. That's not where our engineering expertise is
going to be leveraged.
We're trying to solve the new problems, the challenges that haven't been solved
before.
But the reality is that the complexity of cars is enormous. The amount of investment
that carmakers need to make and R&D is just astronomical. And so to maintain
development engineering of one front-facing camera architecture and then have
something separate, totally diﬀerent code base, totally diﬀerent hardware platform
or other aspects, it doesn't make sense for them.
So they've come to us and said, hey. We want to leverage what we're doing at the
high end and just be able to bring it down into that front-facing camera solution.
So again, we see carmakers adopting our platform across the whole spectrum and
seeing huge savings from that as opposed to just saying, okay. I want to take this one
part of this one segment.
Again, it's not just about what goes in the car, but training that AI, they don't want to
have two totally diﬀerent systems that they're collecting data, two diﬀerent initiatives.
They're doing diﬀerent development, diﬀerent training, diﬀerent testing, diﬀerent
validation when they can do all this across a single architecture. It's an enormous
cost savings.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03

So your ability to kind of train and import that learning from the data center directly
into the car, so the car is able to make inference decisions driving software policies is
based on the data that you've trained on.
{BIO 16651500 <GO>}
That's right.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
Is a fairly big diﬀerentiator.
{BIO 16651500 <GO>}
It's enormous. They got -- again, as you talk to automakers, right, they -- and this is
why sometimes you see these partnerships going on because it is an enormous
investment. And again, we can take two diﬀerent investments for the same car
company and combine them.
{BIO 16383656 <GO>}
Okay. All right. Wonderful. I think we're heating up.
We're about 11:55.
So we'll leave it at there. Thank you so much, Danny. Thank you, Stewart. This is very
insightful, and thanks again.
{BIO 16651500 <GO>}
All right. Thank you, everyone.
