{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
My name is Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. I'm delighted to welcome
Vikas Mehta, who's a Finance Director and also member of the Investor Relations
team from Microsoft. I know you wanted to make some introductory remarks. So
(multiple speakers) that?
{BIO 15971926 <GO>}
Yes. So ﬁrst of all, I'd like to thank you for this phenomenal opportunity. It's a
privilege to be over here. And I'm thrilled to talk to ﬁnancial analysts and investors.
Before we begin, I just wanted to remind everyone that we may be making a
forward-looking statement that may be subject to risks and uncertainties. Please
review our security ﬁlings which describe these risks and uncertainties. With that, we
can begin.

{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
Great. So one of the things that's maybe less well-known about Vikas is that you were
actually a ﬁnance manager right at the start of the origination of the Azure business
and the Oﬃce 365 business. And so I actually wanted to start there because those
businesses have become really important for the Microsoft story in the last few years.
Let's start with Azure, ﬁrst of all.
So when you were starting oﬀ that full program, what do you think were the key kind
of early decisions that Microsoft made around that strategy that have proven to be
important to the success of that business?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-11

Yes. So I think that (inaudible) Azure and Oﬃce 365 and all of the cloud businesses
are having phenomenal success right now. In fact, we are seeing a phenomenal user
adoption as well as increase in users that is driving consistent triple-digit revenue
growth. But if you look back, a lot of the success right now stems back to the early
decisions that we took and the early bet that we made on the cloud.
So if you think about Azure, we launched Azure in February of 2010, which is almost
ﬁve years back. At that time, industry analysts and competitors thought that this
move would be cannibalistic to our revenue. And would be dilutive to our earnings.
However, we ﬁrmly believed that there was a tectonic shift under way, a shift similar
in proportion to what you saw with Client-Server or the PC revolution. And we knew
that there would be matching scenarios and overall this would be accretive to our
business. So I'd say the biggest and the boldest thing that we did was we fully-
embraced cloud. This meant that we had a massive global feel and theme to the
cloud.
This was challenging for a number of reasons, because our business model had
predominantly been a software license business. And we were shifting it to make it a
fundamentally users-based model. Secondly, we were investing millions of dollars in
capital expenditures and that meant a number of new things for us. But I'd say we
learned a number of important lessons, here.
First of all, it's infused a whole cloud DNA in everything that we did, whether it is
engineering agility, or whether it is robust supply chain and operations that we have
now. We had a few missteps along the way. But we quickly recovered. And what you
see in terms of a lot of success that we have stems back to those early decisions. I'd
say it's not easy to be a big cloud player. And you might try to have take your way
into it. But you have to live it. You have to build your own infrastructure and over
time, success will come.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
One of the things that struck me was you stepped outside of the normal boundaries
of what was comfortable for Microsoft, such as supporting alternative operating
systems like Linux, or for example the (inaudible) with Oracle to support Oracle
databases in a Microsoft environment. So when did you come to the realization that
you had to be a more sort of open player, as opposed to just playing with the
Microsoft set?
{BIO 15971926 <GO>}
Yes. So, our Azure strategy has evolved over time. It started as a platform, as a
services oﬀering for Azure. And over time we expanded the vision to make it a cloud
that has no boundaries or no limits. And what that means is that we said we're going
to address all the diﬀerent customer segments, whether they are enterprise, whether
it is charge up, whether it is lees to enable them to build application across any
operating system, across any data set, across any language or framework. And
enable it to be used for any device operating system, essentially. And such a broad-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-11

A - Vikas Mehtabased new vision then Steve was the president of the group. And I think it took three
major steps in that direction.
The ﬁrst one was to make it easy for enterprises to onboard to the cloud, that was
through both introduction of Infrastructure-as-a-Service, as well as build a lot of
hybrid capability into our platform.
The second was with regard to cross-platform. And it was across the board as I said,
on multiple layers, whether it was adding Linux to the mix in a addition to Windows.
In fact we have now 20% of Azure that runs Linux. We added a lot of diﬀerent
databases in addition to SQL Server. So now you can bring Oracle database or IBM
DB2. And even open-source databases like Mongo, Cassandra, as well as Hadoop.
And even on the languages and the frameworks, in addition to .NET you can have
Java, or open source languages like PHP Python and you know, that extends up to
the device OS, also.
The third, most important thing, was we were very aggressive in terms of
partnership. And this extended all the way from big players like Oracle, SAP, IBM,
Salesforce, to other players like Cloudera, Hortonworks, Core OS as well as Docker.
So all ﬁxes there was to make sure that we give our customers a choice. We knew
that enterprises run heterogeneous environments. And in order for us to be the one-
stop-shop, we have to provide these to the CIO. So I'd say it has been an evolution.
And something which has made us more successful.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
How important has -- Microsoft's had for some time, some big ﬁrst-party scale, web
scale applications, like Bing, for example. When I think of other players that come
from an enterprise software heritage that are trying to think about the cloud, they
don't necessarily have that ﬁrst party web scale application experience. How
important was that, to have that in the evolution of Azure, where you saw it today?
{BIO 15971926 <GO>}
Yes, ﬁrst-party applications have deﬁnitely been a big structural advantage for us.
And if you think about -- fundamentally the way we think about infrastructure is not
an isolation of all ﬁrst-party applications. And if you look back in history we launched
Windows Server in the 90s. But the real power came because of our ﬁrst-party
applications, like SQL Server Exchange, SharePoint and Lync. And with every iteration
the feedback loop just got better and better. And we were able to create a very
good, robust operating system.
The same holds true for Azure, where we were reinventing the infrastructure for our
own modern application needs. And as it turns out to be everyone else also needs
that. So when you think about our ﬁrst-party applications we have more than 200
web services at Microsoft. They are diverse and have a very honest skill which makes
us see this robust platform.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-11

A - Vikas MehtaLet me give you a few examples. If you think about Xbox and Skype, they have
millions of subscribers who are actively engaging on the platform. On the other
hand, you have assets like Bing and OneDrive, that store petabytes of data. And
these are a very diverse set of workloads also which means that you have all the way
from CPU simulation for gaming, for Xbox Live, to productivity for Oﬃce 365 to
applied machine learning for Bing.
So being able to in-house learn from these ﬁrst-party applications has given us a very
phenomenal learning ground to better attack our platform. And then use this virtual
cycle to take this learning to third parties and bring eﬃciency to their applications.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
And just on that. So, some of the other competitors in public cloud infrastructure
don't necessarily have the legacy of on-premise software. So in a way, Microsoft's in
a bit of a unique position. You use ﬁrst-party web scale applications and services.
And you've got this legacy base sort of -- I don't know, legacy, I guess encompasses
all the applications. Does that make Microsoft unique today in the sort of strategy
and the way that you sell to a CIO/CCO about value prop?
{BIO 15971926 <GO>}
Absolutely. You know, if you think about our strategy, there are three key pillars to
that. The ﬁrst one is hyper scale infrastructure, the second is hybrid strength. And the
third is enterprise-grade services. Now, if you think about the traditional players, we
have typically not invested in data centers at the scale that we have done. We have
19 regions across the world, which is even bigger than what Amazon and Google
provide.
And we are the only players with this hyper scale who also provide the consistency
across on-premise and cloud. In fact, if you from a hybrid perspective, if you have a
workload on Windows Server, you can easily move that to a service provider cloud or
to our public cloud. And essentially we give a very good portability. And ﬁnally, the
aspect of enterprise-grade services, if you think about the Internet scale providers
like Google or Amazon, they actually are hyper scale for sure. But when it comes to
providing hybrid and enterprise-grade services, we have a rich and a deep expertise
around that area. So we feel pretty good about the competitive position there.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
So back to what you started with, which was when you made the decision to go in
the cloud, you felt that it would not be cannibalistic. And a lot of it would be additive.
And I think what we've all seen in the last year, year-and-a-half, you look at the way
you now report your commercial license is growing still. And your commercial cloud
businesses are growing obviously very rapidly. But important piece is that
commercial license business is still growing. Is that sustainable? I mean, I guess that's
the question I get a lot, is at what point do we actually cannibalize? What's your --?
{BIO 15971926 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-11

Page 5 of 10A - Ross MacMillan
A - Vikas MehtaNo. I think that's a good question. I'd say that what kept me in the historical tectonic
shift that happened whether it was as I said, client-server PC revolution or
virtualization, then there was a lot of consolidation that happened or that was a lot of
shifts or destruction that happened. But the key point was that it drove a lot of
productivity. And with it came an increased spend.
So if you think about IT spend as a percentage of GDP through all those diﬀerent
revolutions, it has gone up and up and up. And we see and we feel the theme, for
the cloud disruption, where we feel that there are maximal scenarios that the cloud
creates, which were not possible in the earlier world, which would help cloud be
accretive rather than be cannibalistic to the overall business. And you see that in
your scenarios for example, with machine learning, big data, analytics, etcetera.
In fact, for us we feel that it creates three times more opportunity from an overall IT
spend share perspective versus what we played in the prior world. The other
important aspect is that the shift from enterprise, from private cloud to public cloud,
doesn't just happen in a switch. We have to go through the situation where they ﬁrst
get into hybrid deployment, learn. And checked out what cloud reliability, availability
and features are.
And then make that switch. And that's what we are seeing right now, where as they
make their switch our revenue for the customer is getting bigger and bigger.
Essentially the enterprises are spending more on our stack for the on-premise side
as well as on the cloud side. But in the long term, we feel that cloud creates newer
opportunities for us and we feel really good about our position right now.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
What about the ﬁnancial characteristics, I guess margins speciﬁcally? Simplistically I
think the way we think about it, is that provisioning basic elements of infrastructure
like use of storage, is a fairly monetized business, or at least the pricing dynamics
suggest it is, because they seem to ratchet down rapidly. Whereas, as you move up
the scale into some more advanced application areas, perhaps that margin structure
is a little better. So could you just help us frame how we should think about how this
transition may or may not impact margins. And maybe it's not a margin question as
much as a proﬁt contribution?
{BIO 15971926 <GO>}
Yes, I think that's probably the right way to look at it, which is the gross margin
dollars as you shift to the cloud. But let me give you a framework about how we think
about it. We think about it in three key pillars, the ﬁrst one is core infrastructure
capability, which essentially drives adoption on the platform.
The second is with regard to hybrid. And giving enterprises a way to have on-ramp
to the cloud. And the third is with higher-level services where you essentially
diﬀerentiate.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-11

Page 6 of 10A - Ross MacMillan
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

A - Vikas MehtaSo then you think about the core infrastructure capabilities. By providing core
infrastructure capabilities actually it helps to bootstrap a lot of high level services. So
I'd not discount core infrastructure capabilities, it is actually very important for
especially the land and expand kind of motion.
We see that a lot with storage, for example, where if we are sort of the provider of
choice for storage, then we see newer scenarios and higher level services we will use
on the top of that. For example, big data analytics, machine learning, or even tiered
storage, tiered cloud storage that for which we have our store simple appliance. So
we see a lot of up-sell to these diﬀerent areas because of that.
The second important aspect I'd like to point out is, sometimes computing storage
are just categorized as a commodity for -- but they are not. You can diﬀerentiate on
those pillars, also. We have our premium storage oﬀering as well as premium
compute oﬀerings for high performance compute as well as source simple storage
appliance, because that what we diﬀerentiated and help us monetize at a batch
level.
The hybrid spend is extremely important, as the second point, where because we
provide this diﬀerentiation and easier on-ramp, we can charge premium for those
consistency and common tools that we provide. And ﬁnally, the higher level service
is absolutely as you go up the stack, whether it is applications or whether it is a
diﬀerentiated IT that we provide to infrastructure capabilities.
They will give you an edge over others. We have services like media services,
machine learning, mobility services, that are premium services. So overall I'd say the
mix of that is really critical. But at the same time having core infrastructure
capabilities which drive adoption is also extremely important. I'll quickly end by
saying that we have a very healthy mixture with over 60% of our customers using the
higher level services.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
I did want to open up for questions. So if there are any questions from the audience,
happy to take them. One here?
(inaudible)
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
Let me just repeat the question, the question's on level of investment to support the
growth in the cloud businesses, given the, it's growth.
{BIO 15971926 <GO>}
Yes, I think that's a great question, it goes back to the ﬁrst question in terms of the
challenges that we face as we shifted the business model. It's a very capital-intensive
business. We have been spending billions of dollars to raise this, build data centers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-11

A - Ross MacMillanAnd even expand capacity for a number of these. And that is the reason, the reason
why it's such a diﬀerentiator for us because not all companies can do that. One, we
have a very strong balance sheet. Second, we have ﬁrst-party applications, as I was
mentioning earlier, where it can help us drive that initial utilization of the tiers. And
after that we can have third-party adoption and further scale it.
But this is deﬁnitely a capital-intensive business. There are only three players that we
see in the long-term being able to sustain this level of investment -- us, Google. And
Amazon. And as I said, we feel really good because of having both hybrid plans as
well as the hyper scale ability to invest in the main infrastructure.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
I'll get to the one in the back ﬁrst?
(inaudible)
{BIO 15971926 <GO>}
Yes, I think that's a great question. I say that our objective is to create this unique,
complete, comprehensive cloud oﬀering which can cater to essentially all diﬀerent
scenarios as well as all diﬀerent customer segments. Cross-platform has been a big
initiative for us. And we have seen great adoption across the board. So we have a
very healthy diverse set of workloads. For example, 20% of Azure is Linux.
Now this is staggering, considering we are predominantly had a Windows Server-
based operating system, even when we started with Azure. And secondly, I'd say
from a customer segmenting perspective again, quite a diverse mix with over 40% of
revenue comes from start-ups and ISVs. So it's not just our enterprise agreements
that are driving it. And we have a pretty healthy mix.
Of course, enterprise is deﬁnitely an area of strength as I mentioned. We have that
vantage point. And we are deﬁnitely securing that. In fact, 57% of Fortune 500 uses
Azure. And you know, invests in Azure. So you can feel pretty good about the overall
spend that we have for the platform.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
Yes?
(inaudible)
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
The question is, more recently you've seen IT spend (inaudible) so how well
positioned is Microsoft to capture more of the aggregate budget?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-11

Page 8 of 10A - Vikas Mehta

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

A - Vikas Mehta{BIO 15971926 <GO>}
No. I think if you look from a holistic perspective over time, you will see that this
mobile-ﬁrst, cloud-ﬁrst vision really disrupts and creates a lot of opportunities. So if
you think about newer scenarios that were not even something you could imagine
prior (inaudible), we see some things all the way from for example, farming
companies who are you know, not companies.
But people who are involved in farming, use Internet of Things, or cloud technology
to understand what are the trends that they need to invest in terms of future
agriculture investments or cycles. From all the way to other industries like hospitality
or banking, where scenarios were just not possible earlier.
So I deﬁnitely feel that these new scenarios are going to expand the TAM. If you
think about areas of interest, big data is catching up really fast, Internet of Things is
deﬁnitely growing. And you see that in our results also where we are, both growing
on the on-premise side as well as in the cloud.
And here the second level that's really important is we are growing fast versus
competitors. So I'd say that we still feel that the trends are really healthy. And we
have this inherent strength to grow both on-premise starts and cloud. But overall in
the long term, cloud is a big opportunity area for us.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
Back here?
(inaudible)
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
Just to repeat the question. So, of the Windows annuity business and how big it's
become over time.
{BIO 15971926 <GO>}
Yes. Well that's a good question. I'd say that if you look at the overall annuity mix for
our enterprise businesses, that has kept growing over time. So people have been
shifting from transactional to annuity. And that is because of the roadmap. The
stronger the roadmap you have, the quicker the iterations that you can make in
terms of pace of innovations. The more comfortable the customers are in terms of
betting on your long-term. So that's what we have seen across the board.
Now, going back to your question, speciﬁcally about Windows, it is a big business
for us, as we last said. It's a $4 billion business for us. And as you rightly pointed it's
been growing at double digits. I'd say that it is -- again, the investment in the long-
term and the roadmap, that if we can come up with quick iterations and keep raisingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-11-11

that.
On that point, I'd say Windows 10 focuses heavily on enterprise features. And we are
catering to a lot of important scenarios for the enterprise. So we feel pretty good
about our volume licensing business on the Windows side.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
Right here?
(inaudible)
{BIO 15971926 <GO>}
Yes, yes. I think it goes back to the earlier point I made with regards to having a
hyper scale infrastructure. And at the same time being able to diﬀerentiate. And that
gives us a unique balance which a lot of other companies don't have. So if you think
about Amazon, speciﬁcally, or even Google for that matter, they have good ﬁrst-party
applications and have the ability to create this hyper scale infrastructure.
And over time can pass the beneﬁts back to customers by price, etcetera. We are in
the unique position with ﬁrst-party applications that are diverse and at scale. And
hence we also have that ability. But the diﬀerence here to there, is that we have this
hybrid strength as well as the diﬀerent theatres in terms of having this long heritage
of enterprise-grade services.
So I give you an example, for example, if you even think about the Gartner Magic
Quadrant, leadership said we were credited in four of the categories that were there,
with infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, X86 virtualization and cloud
storage. Amazon was only in two of these. And Google I believe was in none of
these.
So having hyper scale is critical, very important. But being able to diﬀerentiate and
provide a comprehensive cloud platform is -- you know, unique to us. And we are
well-positioned from that perspective.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
We've run out of time. So thank you so much, Vikas. Great. Great time.
