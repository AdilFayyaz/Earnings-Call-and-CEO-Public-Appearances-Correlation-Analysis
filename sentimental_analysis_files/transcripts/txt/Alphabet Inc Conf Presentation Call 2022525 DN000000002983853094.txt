So, with that out of the way, so I'm Doug Anmuth, J.P. Morgan's Internet analyst. I'm
joined by my colleague, Tien-Tsin Huang, our payments analyst. We're very pleased
to have with us today, Bill Ready, Google's President of Commerce and Payments.
Before joining Google, Bill was the Chief Operating Oﬃcer at PayPal. Prior to that,
Bill was CEO of Braintree and Venmo, building both of those from early-stage start-
ups into industry leaders, which were ultimately acquired by PayPal. So welcome, Bill.
{BIO 16847604 <GO>}
Good morning. Thanks for having me.
So, I touched on your background a little, but would love for you to tell us a lot more.
{BIO 16847604 <GO>}
Sure, yes. Well, again, thanks for having me here. And yeah, I think, you hit me the
high points there. Joined Google in January of 2020 to lead Commerce, and I also
lead Payments in our Next Billion Users, which you can think of as emerging marketsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

Bill Readyeﬀectively. And yeah, prior to that 20-plus years building FinTech and commerce
with many of those building across ﬁve start-ups, the two most noteworthy, Venmo
and Braintree, and then, yeah, I was COO at PayPal, spent 6.5 years there before
coming over to Google.
Okay. Great. So maybe you can talk more about your role at Google, Commerce,
Payments, you mentioned Next Billion Users as well.
{BIO 16847604 <GO>}
Yeah. So joined in January of 2020 to lead the commerce eﬀorts, which include
shopping and travel. And really within commerce, we're looking, just as Google has
always stood for the free and open web, we're trying to support a free and open
commerce ecosystem. Trying to make it so that if you're a consumer and you're
looking for what's the best product, what are the best places to buy, what are all the
most relevant pieces of information to understand about a product, how we make
sure that you can have a great place to start your shopping journey no matter where
that shopping journey ends.
And then on the merchant or suppliers side of that, trying to make sure that we're
giving retailers of all types and sizes great ways to connect with consumers through
every stage of their shopping journey and really trying to help build a deeper
connection between consumers, retailers and suppliers across those journeys.
And then with Payments that has come in more recently, similarly looking to make
sure that we're giving consumers great low-friction experiences and connecting
them with more deeply with the ﬁnancial services that they use and love.
So, in terms of making Google the best place to start the shopping journey, what
goes into that? How are you really making that happen for consumers?
{BIO 16847604 <GO>}
Yeah. So, there is quite a lot that we've done there. Retail has been a large vertical for
Google for many years, 20-plus years for Google in retail. As Philipp's talked about
on our earnings calls, it's been the largest contributor to growth in the ads business
for several quarters running. And we now have more than 1 billion-plus shopping
sessions per day across Google. So we think there is a really signiﬁcant opportunity
to help enable an open ecosystem, help consumers connect with all the many places
that they may want to buy and help the broader retail ecosystem engage with the
consumer as they're shifting to digital as a much more signiﬁcant portion of their
overall shopping engagement. And we've seen really great progress in those things.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 3 of 12Doug Anmuth
Bill ReadyI mentioned the 1 billion-plus shopping sessions per day. We've also had really good
success in building up the merchant and supplier side of that -- you get suppliers
within the travel space, building up that side of the equation as well as we've done
things like opened up free shopping listings. We've seen that those things have not
only improved comprehensiveness for consumers, so that consumers can think
about coming to Google for any kind of product they might imagine buying and
have conﬁdence that they're going to ﬁnd any product they might imagine buying,
but also ﬁnd all the best places to buy all the most relevant information about it. But
then, we've been able to attract really great growth in the merchant side of that as
we opened a free shopping list as we saw that not only did that create a signiﬁcant
lift in consumer clicks at the time we talked about when we did free shopping things
that led to a 50%-plus lift in clicks.
As a result of that, within our shopping eﬀorts, we saw that that went to a broader
more diverse set of merchants. So this notion of helping merchants engage more
fully as a consumer moves to digital, we've seen that as we made those kinds of
changes that's beneﬁted merchants of every size and type from the very largest to
the very smallest, but we've seen that smaller and mid-sized businesses beneﬁted
disproportionately from these things. So this eﬀort of really democratizing access for
merchants and making sure the consumers have as much or more choice in the
digital world as they had in the physical world, we think there is really good progress
across those things. Obviously, a lot more to do, we're still quite busy building for
those things, but we see really good progress there.
And it's a place where we have ongoing eﬀorts around how do we make those
consumer experiences better and better, meet the consumer where they are in their
shopping journey, but also make sure that we're building up a really great multisided
platform around these things we've talked about, things like our Shopping Graph,
where we have 24 billion-plus product listings now that again are part of how we're
using AI and ML to make sure that we have not only a catalog of products for
anything user might want, but all the relevant information about those products.
So that's the shopping and the discovery side of it, right, Bill? So what about
checkout, right? I know you said many times checkout is hard, the payment side is
hard, you have Buy on Google. So how does that ﬁt within all of that?
{BIO 16847604 <GO>}
Yeah. So, great questions. We've made a number of updates. I talked about some of
the updates to Shopping like opening up free shopping things. We've made some
updates to Buy on Google as well, where one of the things we wanted to make sure
that we did is: One, solve for friction in the buying experience, but at the same time,
make sure that we're really clear that we're not a retailer, we're not trying to be a
retailer, we're here to help empower the retail ecosystem. And so, with Buy on
Google, we try to make it very clear that that is an experience they can help solve for
what I think of as in-context purchasing. But it's still helping to connect a consumer
and a merchant directly, right, where a retailer think about not just gaining aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 12Doug Anmuth
Bill Readytransaction, but gaining a customer. And I think this is something that is quite
important in the way that we're approaching an open commerce ecosystem is that
making sure that the consumer fully understands who they're buying from and
consumers want to understand that, they want to make informed choices about who
they're buying from for multiple reasons, some of that is going to be about how they
think about the product and service, some of that is going to be things like wanting
to shop their values whether it's supporting a minority-owned business or
supporting a business in the local community, all these things are important for the
consumer understanding who they're buying from, but it's also really important for
the merchant if they want to connect directly. And so with Buy on Google, we've
refactored that to allow for in-context purchases, so that when a user is ready to buy
and they can do it right in the moment, they can do that, but the seller still gains a
customer, not just a transaction.
And we've continued other eﬀorts in reducing friction in the checkout experience.
We talked about at Google Marketing Live this week that we have a new experience
that we're going to be rolling out that eﬀectively enables the user to fast-forward
from our surface straight into the merchant's own checkout, because we see there's
a variety of buying experiences that users are going to want depending upon the
level of consideration for a purchase that a -- some of the things that you might think
of is like an impulse buyer or something that you just -- it's a lower consideration
purchase, you know everything you need to know, maybe ready to buy right there in
that moment, we want to enable those things. But then for a lot of transactions -- in
fact, the majority of transactions, there's more consideration to consumers going to
want to connect to the retailer, ﬁnd more information from the retailer. And so, there,
we have already the largest portion of our traﬃc, this can go to the retailer site
directly. And now with things like what we're doing with our the buy-now that we're
putting into our product listings fast-forwarding you to straight into the merchant's
checkout, so taking out several steps of friction, getting the user right into the
merchant's own checkout, but still again allowing that direct connection between the
consumer and the merchant. So there's not an intermediary in between, but we're
helping to facilitate a deeper connection versus acting as an intermediary.
And this is all with an open model, commission-free model (inaudible) talked about?
{BIO 16847604 <GO>}
Exactly right. Yeah. And these things, of course, naturally, Google from the very
beginning has stood for the free and open Web and invested in the free and open
Web and we build many of our products that are free, make the -- help the web and
mobile ecosystem function better. And those things pay dividends for our business
in other ways. The more people are engaging online, those things lend themselves
to opportunities for merchants and sellers to promote their business. And so those
things end up having long-term beneﬁts to our businesses as well, but this has been
consistent with our model from the very beginning of supporting a lot of free
experiences, but then of course have opportunities for people to pay to promote as
well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

Bill ReadyYou've talked about the 24 billion-plus listings in the Shopper Graph. How is that
adding value to Google, if you can talk more about the Shopper Graph and all the
beneﬁts that you get there and how consumers really beneﬁt as well?
{BIO 16847604 <GO>}
Yeah. So this is, as I mentioned a little bit, I think, this is a place where we believe we
can add a lot of value to the ecosystem. And we've seen -- we've all had the
experience of the pandemic. There is no one retailer that can serve every need of
every consumer. And being able to provide for consumers a place where they can
start their shopping journey and know that no matter what products they are looking
for, no matter where they may want to ultimately buy that, they're going to be able to
discover all the products that are relevant for them, discover all the relevant places
that they might want to buy, discover all the relevant information about that product,
whether it's things like, is it -- how fast can I get it online, is it available in stock near
me, what are interesting reviews about those experiences; if I'm buying apparel, can
I go see a style guide or watch an unboxing video on YouTube, all these things really
bring all that information to bear for the user, we think, is quite beneﬁcial for the
user, but really enable by what we've done with our Shopping Graph, which is built
on the same or very similar AI and ML technology to the Knowledge Graph that has
been a big part of powering Search for some time now. And so we think that
capability of being able to say, we can bring all that relevant information to bear for
the user is a very important capability, one that we think serves the ecosystem well.
And as part of also how we're able to meet the user in multiple moments through
their shopping journey. So part of our Shopping strategy has been not only enabling
the consumer to ﬁnd all the most relevant information, giving them a great place to
start their shopping journeys, but meeting them where they are in their shopping
journey. So whether it's right in the Search results or if it's in a Discover feed or
watching a video on YouTube or an image search, across all these diﬀerent moments
where the user might be engaging in places where they might have high intent
they're just looking for, I know the product I want, help me understand more about it
where to buy it or earlier stage discovery where they may still be browsing and
exploring, meeting the user in those moments, what we can do with our Shopping
Graph around that product understanding and bring into those moments that
matter, we think is we've seen really great progress with it so far. And we think there
is a lot more that we can do around enabling more of those kinds of experiences
more meeting the user where they are across diﬀerent moments in their journey.
Okay. Great. So, something that gets discussed a lot Mr. Cross [ph] discussions with
investors. We've seen pretty signiﬁcant changes happening in retail over the last few
years. Curious what trends you think will stick and which ones are you really most
excited about going forward.
{BIO 16847604 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 12Yeah. So I think there is a number of things that are quite interesting. I think, ﬁrst and
foremost, yes, the consumer has shifted their behavior to digital signiﬁcantly. And I
think there is a lot of, obviously, everyone is sort of watching to understand, like,
okay, how is that going to continue to evolve, what's happening as users are coming
back into the real world. And I think it's important to note that you still have 80% of
retail approximately is in-store. And we've seen consumers come back in-store,
we've seen that that's quite encouraging to see the consumers are coming back in a
store. But I think there is an important trend around how users are still engaging with
digital, even as they come back in the store.
So Philipp talked about this in our Q1 earnings as well, which is, we think that while
omni-channel has been around for a while, I think, it is here in full force now. So what
we see is that there is a signiﬁcant amount of consumers that are engaging digitally
even when the journey ends up in the store. So things -- and these are things like
tried and true omni-channel experiences like buy online, pickup in the store. But
then also people that are just starting shopping journeys online before they come
into the store.
So I talked about it at Google Marketing Live this week that we see this across the
ecosystem that two-thirds of users will start their shopping journey online regardless
of where that shopping journey ends. So while you'd say, if you just looked at a e-
commerce versus in-store split, you'd say, okay, well, 80% is in the store and roughly
20% is e-commerce. But if you look at the digital inﬂuence, e-commerce is a part of
that, but there's a digital inﬂuence that's well beyond that. And I think, this is part of -
- and again, nobody has a perfect predict for how consumers are going to continue
changing their behavior, it's evolved quite rapidly, but I think the stickiness of digital
is more than just e-commerce like these omni-channel experiences.
And so, there is the traditional omni-channel like buy online, pickup in store, but
there's a lot of other things where digital and physical are blending together, where
people have become accustomed to the kind of information they would have had in
e-commerce journey that even if they're coming back in the store, they still want that
same level of information, right, all these things that went with their shopping
journey where they wanted to see a style guide, watch their favorite creator talk
about why they loved a product and what was really great about it or ﬁnd out other
relevant information about alternatives to it. People still want that same kind of
information, even if they may also want to walk into a store and like touch it and feel
it and try it on, they're not giving up the additional information that they had
previously gotten.
So I think you see that through things like the two-thirds of shoppers that will start
their shopping journey online even when it -- regardless of where it ends up either in
e-commerce purchase or in-store. I think there's also a lot of really interesting
progress on doing more for the users' digital shopping journey. I think the ﬁrst 20
years of e-commerce was solving much more for buying, but not as much for
Shopping. And so the distinction between those things, if you look at how Shopping
has always existed in the in the real-world, there is a big element of shopping that
was not just about how do I get a thing the cheapest and fastest, but how am I -- itFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 12was -- there was a joy to it, right, there was a past time to it, there was a -- people
relished walking the bazaar and discovering the new thing they wouldn't have found.
If you think about your own shopping journeys, right, you walk into a grocery store
and you probably had 5 or 10 things on your list that you needed, but when you
walked out of the grocery store 90% of what was in your cart, you sort of walked up
and down the aisles and found those things or if you walked into a shopping mall,
you may have had a sense for, oh I've got an event I'm going to, I want to get this
thing for the event and you walk around, you discover and you stumble upon things
you might not have thought if you had a general sense, but you sort of had a lot of
inspiration and discovery along the way.
And I think that the ﬁrst 20 years of e-commerce was not solving as much for that, it
was more how do I get the cheapest or the fastest. I think now, as consumers are
engaging digitally across much more of their shopping, this other part of the
shopping journey in many ways has always been one of the largest parts of the
shopping journey in the real world. I think there is now a lot more opportunity for
that as that comes into the digital world. And so you see us solving for these types of
things, browsy [ph] shopping that we did for the holidays, we're bringing a lot more
rich visual content, a more browsable experience right into our main Search results
page. So that a user could on things that are -- we think of it is like categorical
queries where the user has a general sense instead of searching for the exact pair of
shoes they want, they'd say running shoes, right, or high heels for a formal event or
whatever, and so they have a general sense. But then, we're helping them browse
and explore and discover through those things. So you see us solving for that with
things like our browsing search results. It's also the case that we're solving for that
kind of discovery with newer technologies as well.
We talked about it at Google Marketing Live, what we're doing at 3D and AR, where
we started about a year ago with AR for beauty -- for beauty try-on and things like
that. So it's great to see what that lipstick looks like on that model, but what if you
want to see on yourself or you want to see if that matches your skin tone or these
kinds of things being able to do that in AR has been extremely beneﬁcial. We talked
about it at Google Marketing Live that we're now expanding that into the home and
garden category, so that you can see online. Okay, here's a chair that I really like, I
can see a 3D image of that chair, but then I can use AR with my phone and see what
that chair will look line in my living room; is it going to ﬁt in the space that I have,
how does it look next to the drapes that I have in my living room, all these things that
are important parts of the user's sort of discovery part of the journey that again has
been not nearly has solved for in the ﬁrst 20 years of e-commerce.
We think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity there and things that we can
do both to give a more inspiration and discovery-driven element to our own
experiences, as well as bring newer technologies like 3D and AR or things we're
doing with Google Lens, where at our Shopping event recently we talked about with
Google Lens for a while, we've talked about how Google Lens helps you shop what
you see, where you can point your phone at anything and will tell you what that
product is, information about it, where you can buy it or if you see an image -- you
see an image of a celebrity that has an outﬁt on that you like, you can screenshot that
and then Google Lens will tell you, oh, well, here's what those shoes are, here'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

Page 8 of 12Doug Anmuth

Doug Anmuthwhere you could get them, or okay, well, I like that look, I'm not going to pay what
that celebrity paid for that thing, how can I get that look for less, so these kinds of
things where there's a lot more to be done in the inspiration discovery, but a lot of
really great technology that we can bring to solve for that like Google Lens like 3D
and AR, and again all powered by our Shopping Graph that we talked about where
that 24 billion of product listings and all that relevant information about them powers
these kinds of experiences like rich visual imagery, 3D imagery, being able to have
Google Lens sort of recognize an image within match it up to a product catalog of
24 billion-plus product listings to give you not just information on that product, but
relevant information around that product like how much you get that same look for
less for these types of things.
Okay. Great. So we know retail has been the biggest driver of Search growth for
many quarters now. When you put together Shopping, Travel and Pay, how do you
see yourself contributing to Google's P&L?
{BIO 16847604 <GO>}
Yeah. So, retail has been the largest contributor to the growth in the ads business for
several quarters running as you noted and Philipp's talked about on our earnings
call. Travel is the next largest contributor to the growth of the ads business right
behind that. And so we've seen Travel really rebounding nicely. Philipp talked about
that in our Q1 call. Searches for -- travel searches in Q1 of this year had surpassed
travel searches in Q1 of '19, so getting back above that pre-pandemic level of travel
searches. And so those are both large categories for us, categories that we have
been investing and continue to invest in where -- again, as I mentioned before,
consistent with what Google has done with the Search and ads business and many
other products where we invest signiﬁcantly in organic experiences or free
experiences, but then those pair -- those are in support of a free and open
ecosystem, but they pair well with our natural business, where that also comes with
opportunities for paid promotion and these kinds of things. And so, as Philip
described in not just our last quarter, but many quarters, these experiences are
drawing more consumers, drawing more merchants and then those come with
natural opportunities to support our business through paid promotions and these
types of things.
So listening to your -- all the comments are great, Bill. Thinking about what you've
said the last couple of questions here. Payment monetization, how would that ﬁt
within everything that you've talked about, because I agree, right, e-commerce has
changed a lot, some bit was buying that was hard, it's been mostly solved and now
we're getting more into the shopping side. So we've seen some of our payment
companies, Bill, starting to talk about advertising, which is completely new for me,
I'm not a advertising guy, you know that. And then both more digital and more omni,
it's easier for software companies, platforms to monetize payments as well. So how
does it ﬁt for Google and Commerce?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 12Bill Ready {BIO 16847604 <GO>}
Yeah. So, I've spent many years in payments and commerce. And I think the
interesting thing is that every commerce journey ultimately ends in a payment. Some
point, it's a commerce journey when it ends in a payment. That also means every
payment experience started with a commerce journey. And so, I think there is a lot of
opportunity in creating better linkage across these things.
I think, again, if you look at what's not yet been while solved for, I think this is one of
those things I've talked about how there is a lot of sort of shopping in sort of
especially shopping beyond buying, the browse and explore that hasn't been solved
for fully. I think also this notion of how do I have a great connected experience from
shopping journey, all the way through to a payments experience, I think, there are
places where you'd have an e-commerce site or a retailer might have solve for these
things, but how does that get solved across the ecosystem, how do we get to a place
where a user, no matter where they're buying, can have a really great shopping
experience, but then also know they're going to have a really high-quality buying
experience across the free and open Web, I think there's a lot to be done to solve for
that and I think this is a place where we think there's a lot that we can contribute
there.
And so some of the things that we've been doing there around, like, we talked about
some of the checkout experiences, as we look to go solve for that, I'll talk more
about some of the speciﬁc things that we're doing there, but I think, just as with
Shopping, I talked about supporting the free and open commerce ecosystem. As we
think about payments, we want to make sure that we're helping to solve for those
experiences in partnership with the ecosystem.
So, strategy is as much or more about what you're not going to do as about what you
are going to do. And so in Shopping, it was really important for us to be very clear
that we're not a retailer, we have no aspirations to be a retailer, we're going to
partner with the retail ecosystem to help them connect in a digital environment. Well,
as we think about payments, we're not a bank, we have no aspirations to be a bank,
we're not looking to go provide the ﬁnancial services that a bank would provide or
compete for those things. We want to help consumers discover and connect more
deeply with all the range of ﬁnancial services available to them and partner with the
ecosystem to go build deeper connections across these things. I think these are --
that's very naturally aligned with I think what people expect from Google and where
we can do a lot to go build those connections as they're coming back to how that
connects with a shopping experience coming to a payments experience.
We talked about things like fast-forwarding the user from a Search result and a
product listing to, okay, I can hit a -- soon be able to hit a Buy Now button on that
fast-forward straight into the merchants' checkout. But then once you get to that
checkout, one of the things that has been quite apparent is that even as there's been
a rise in Buy buttons and we have our own, there are other good ones out in the
ecosystem, you still have for most retailers, many, if not most retailers, the majority of
the checkout is still somebody putting in a card and a credit card entry form, andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 12Doug Anmuth
Bill Readythose are high friction. There is things that are left to be desired around safety and
security and those kinds of things. So the things we've done with like virtual cards
that we talked about at Google I/O, where right within Chrome autoﬁll across any
checkout on the Web, we're looking to go enable a user to say, okay, with the card I
was already going to use at the merchant I was already going to checkout with, I can
have a seamless, safe and secure experience, because we're going to help that user
have a virtual card, writing context in partnership with issuers and networks in the
ecosystem that provides those cards directly, but then also right in line with how the
merchant already handles their checkout through their existing checkout process,
through their existing processor.
And so these are examples of where we can meet the user in their natural journey,
bring things that help connect the user more deeply with their existing products,
take friction out of the process, but do it in partnership with the ecosystem. And I
think, this is quite important: one, because there's a lot of, for example, checkout
that's not yet been solved for, but also as we think about how we are approaching
that we think we can also distinguish our approach versus that of others. If you look
at -- if you're an issuer and you've seen the rise of buy buttons, on the one hand, you
say, oh, I need to participate in those things, because it's bringing conversion, it's
bringing security, but am I giving at the cut of my transaction, is there going to be a
competitive product from the very provider of that buy button, where, okay, I don't
want to be in the buy button, but they're competing with me as well, because they're
issuing their own credit cards or issuing -- they've got their own depository account,
so they've got a checking account and expanding services around it, we want to
approach these things in a way where we are very clearly doing it in partnership with
the ecosystem.
So that as we roll these things out not only as a great for the consumer and the
merchant and deepening the connections there, but saying, how do we help the
ﬁnancial services ecosystem, connect in the moment with the user in these moments
that matter, but again done in a way that beneﬁts the ecosystem in partnership with
the ecosystem where, as I said, I can use my existing card, the issuers and networks
participate as they always would have, they're not worrying about a cut of the
transaction going as we don't take a cut of the transaction, we haven't taken out on
tap to pay for years and we're not issuing competing products. And so, we think that
can be a healthy way to build across a free and open ecosystem there as well.
Very clear. So, you mentioned in retail, you obviously don't want to compete with
retailers. This is -- it's often debated across the travel space as well. So can you talk
about how you think about Google's role in travel and is it very similar eﬀectively to
what you're doing in more traditional retail?
{BIO 16847604 <GO>}
Yeah, it's a very common strategy or very similar strategy to what we're doing in retail
and what I just talked about in payments, where we think we can do a lot to bridge
the consumer with a whole range of suppliers and have an open ecosystem ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 11 of 12Doug Anmuth
Bill Readysuppliers, whether those suppliers are airlines or hoteliers or OTAs, we think we can
do a lot to create deeper connections there. And just as we're doing in Shopping,
where we're pairing great free experiences with great opportunities to promote
yourself, we're doing the same in travel.
So we talked about what we're doing with free shopping listings, well, similarly we
have free booking links that we've opened up, so that just as with free shopping
listings that made it so that any retailer of any size or type can make their entire
inventory discoverable across all the surfaces of Google, similarly with free booking
links, we've made it so that if you're a hotelier and you want to be discoverable on
our surface, you can do that for free, you can certainly choose to pay to promote
yourself if you want, but you can -- not only can you appear free as you think about
your room types and all these diﬀerent kinds of things in the same way that free
shopping listings removed barriers to a retailer having the full inventory
discoverable, what we're doing is things like free booking links. And our hotels
product allows for hoteliers to not only make sure that hoteliers of every size and
type to make sure that they themselves are discoverable, but as I think about their
diﬀerent room types and all these kinds of things, taking away those barriers which is
great for the ecosystem and great for consumers, and again, I think a nice virtuous
cycle between those things and helping to deepen connections there as well in the
same way that I talked about for shopping and for payments and ﬁnancial services
and travel as well. We think that allows us to play a unique role of helping the
consumer understand all the relevant information for them in a travel journey, it's,
yes, I want to understand my ﬂight and my hotel, plus other things like what are the
things I want to do when I get there, what are all the -- what's it going to be like
visiting Paris right now, like, I haven't been there since before the pandemic, what's it
going to be like now, all these things are really relevant to that journey, we think we
can play a unique role in solving for those and bridging those connections.
And similar to what I said about shopping, where there is more than just the buy, I
think travels is another one where, yes, there's a whole bunch that we're doing
around helping with bookings for ﬂights and hotels, on connecting the user with the
suppliers on those things. But there's a lot more to do in the discovery and
inspiration part of these things like what am I going to do when I get to that place
and what's it like when I get there and how do I discover other information about
what other people think about it. So in shopping I might want to see a YouTube
video of a style guide or a content creator that's going to tell me about a great new
product that they're unboxing, well, travel, you see some of the things like people
want to know what (inaudible) doing, what's interesting right now and so bringing all
that information to bear, again, we think is a pretty unique role that we can play and
help bridge a lot of connections.
All right. Great. We are out of time, so we're going to leave it there. But thank you,
Bill. Really appreciate you being here.
