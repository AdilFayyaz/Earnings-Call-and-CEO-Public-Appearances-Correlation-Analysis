Good morning, and welcome to WWDC. WWDC is an incredibly important event to
Apple, our developers and our users. It's here that we bring some of our biggest
innovations to life. And we have not stopped innovating, doing the work that will
enrich people's lives for years to come, because we're all looking forward to a more
hopeful tomorrow. That's why we believe it's so important to have WWDC this year.
And while it cannot possibly feel the same in here without you, I can assure you that
we have a great show ahead of us. This year, we're delivering the conference in a
whole new way to all of you around the world directly to your home. And we want to
welcome you to our home here at Apple Park.
I'd like to ﬁrst talk to you about two big things that are happening in the world right
now. To start, I want to address the topic of racism, inequality and injustice, and to
recognize the pain being felt throughout our nation, especially in our black andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22

of this past month are sadly not new, they have caused us to face long-standing
institutional inequalities and social injustices. This country was founded on the
principles of freedom and equality for all.
For too many people and for too long, we haven't lived up to those ideals. We are
inspired and moved by the passionate people around our nation and around the
world who have stood up to demand change. We must all aim far higher to build a
future that lives up to our ideals. This means taking action. Two weeks ago, we
announced Apple's racial equity and justice initiative with a commitment of $100
million, starting in the United States and expanding over time, this initiative will
challenge systemic barriers that limit opportunity for communities of color in the
critical areas of education, economic equality and criminal justice.
We also announced something important for this community, the new developer
entrepreneur account for Black developers. We want to do everything we can to
foster the brightest lights and best ideas. At Apple, our mission has always been to
make the world a better place and we're committed to being a force for change.
Right now, our world is also battling a virus that is aﬀecting the daily lives of billions
of people. We want to thank the dedicated people everywhere, especially our
healthcare workers who have made tremendous sacriﬁces to take care of those in
need. We've also seen the profound impact our products have had. People are
relying on them more than ever to remain connected to family and friends, to do
their work, to express their creativity, to be entertained as well as to entertain others.
Today, the world is counting on all of us and on the products and experiences that
we create to move forward. Because throughout history great challenges have been
met with great creativity and important breakthroughs. That's why we're so excited
about this year's conference. This is going to be truly a unique week [ph], delivered
unlike any that we've done before. There will be more than 100 engineering-led
video sessions, one-on-one consultations with Apple engineers, developer forums
and so much more delivered to you from diﬀerent locations right here at Apple Park.
And this year the conference will be available to our entire community of $23 million
developers as well as anyone who is interested for free.
Presenting the conference in this way allows us to be more inclusive than ever.
Perhaps this will inspire the next generation of developers. So even though we can't
be together in person, in some ways we're going to be more together than ever.
Today, we're going to push each of our platforms forward in some exciting and
breakthrough ways.
With that let's get started by sending it [ph] over to Craig.
{BIO 6190419 <GO>}
Good morning. Great to have you here. As you can see we've got a lot to cover, so
let's get started with iOS. Together with iPhone iOS is central to how we navigate ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 3 of 35lives and stay connected. And now we're making it even more powerful and easier to
use. Our new release is iOS 14. This year we spent time rethinking some of the most
iconic elements of the experience on iPhone. And we started here with a carefully
considered home screen that has truly stood the test of time.
Of course, over the years, we kept the fundamentals largely the same, but carefully
added features like folders for organizing your apps, widgets for quick information
and personalized experiences powered by on-device intelligence that serve up just
the right thing, at just the right moment. It's hard to imagine iPhone without these
features now.
Well, that brings us to this year. We're doing more on our iPhones today than ever
before. So we've re-thought some of the core elements of iOS to reﬂect this. Let me
give you a quick peek.
(video presentation)
This is going to be amazing. Let's dig in starting with the home screen. Today's home
screen works great. But as we get more and more apps we can end up with this, lots
and lots of pages and we tend to forget what's beyond the ﬁrst couple. Wouldn't it
be great if there was a way to organize all of those apps without doing a thing. Well
this year, we're doing just with something called the app library. It's a new space at
the end of your home screen pages that automatically organizes all your apps in one
simple and easy to navigate view.
Let me show you. Here's my home screen. Now like you I have muscle memory built
for the ﬁrst page or two. But when it comes to all of these pages, well, honestly I've
lost track of where a lot of things are. And that's where the app library comes in. You
can see that all of my apps are automatically organized here. In fact now with the
app library I actually don't need all those pages for all my apps. So we created an
easy way to hide out pages. I just go into jiggle mode, tap the darts at the bottom
and check this out, I get a zoomed out view of all my pages.
I can simply tap to hide the pages I no longer need, just like that. And now with
those pages hidden, app library is always just a swipe or two away. So here in app
library, getting to the app I'm looking for is really easy. Up at the top I've the search
ﬁeld and I get all my apps organized from A to Z. Now over here on the upper left, I
have suggestions, that uses on-device intelligence to show me the apps that I'm
likely to need next. And on the right is recently added, giving me access to the apps
that I have recently downloaded from the App Store.
And below are intelligently curated categories. So I can tap into a category like
Apple Arcade and see all of my apps in that category. Well, now let's go back. You
may notice that in each of these categories the apps I use most are right here at the
top level. So I can launch one of these directly with just a tap. So that's App Library.
We think this is going to make it easier than ever to get to your apps.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 4 of 35Next, let's turn to widgets. Today, widgets help me get information at a glance. But a
lot has changed, since we ﬁrst introduced these. Now we have Apple Watch, where
we're able to surface so much information on a small screen that you wear on your
wrist. Well this year we're taking all that we've learned to create a completely re-
imagined experience for widgets. To start they're more beautiful and data rich, and
we're introducing diﬀerent sizes. So you can choose one that best ﬁts your needs.
Let's take a look at them in iOS 14.
So let's swipe over to today view and take a look at our new widgets, they're just
beautiful. And the new designs are more data rich than ever. And you can see they
now come in a variety of sizes. So you can pick just the right level of information for
each one. Now we liked these new widgets so much, we wanted to make them even
more accessible. So check this out. I'm just going to tap and hold on the weather
widget, and I can drag it out of today view and on to my home screen. And watch as
I move it around, the apps just dance out of the way to make space for my new
widget.
Well have a second one. Just kind of tap the plus here in the upper left and grab on
the podcast. I can drop it just like that. Now I'm going to swipe over to page two
here and bring back up the widget gallery. The gallery is a great place to explore
widgets. Now when I tap on one I can actually page through all of the diﬀerent sizes
available, just like this. But you know right now what I want to do is grab this widget
up top. It's a really special one. It's called the smart stack. I'm just going to tap it and
drop it here.
With the smart stack I can easily swipe through widgets to pick just the one I want for
the moment. But what's really cool is that the smart stack can actually do this for me
automatically. So in the morning, I can get my news brieﬁng. Throughout the day ﬁnd
out when I have a meeting coming up. And then the evening I might get a summary
of my activity for the day. So that's widgets on the home screen. We're excited to see
how everyone will customize them in their own way.
Next, we're also bringing picture-in-picture to iPhone, so you can access apps on
your iPhone while watching video or talking on a FaceTime call. Let me show you. So
here in my home screen the Smart Stack is showing me the TV widget. So I can just
tap to start playing the show. Now check this out. When I swipe to go home, the
video automatically goes in a picture-in-picture right over the home screen. And
when I launch another app, like notes I can keep watching.
Now I can drag the picture to another part of the screen. If I want to make it bigger. I
can even pinch to zoom. And as I move between applications it stays with me. And
what's cool if I can also swipe it to the side and the audio keeps playing when it's oﬀ-
screen. Now here on the home screen, I can bring it back out if I want and I have
controls to get back to full screen playback or I can just tap the X to close it. And
that's picture-in-picture video. It's a great way to continue enjoying your video while
tapping into everything else your iPhone can do for you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22

Page 5 of 35Yael GartenAnd that's a quick look at the updates to the core elements of iOS. We think these
new features are going to make iOS even more hep in a moment. Another iconic
experience that's getting a major update is Siri. As much as Siri's advanced over the
years the visual interface for interacting with it has remained largely unchanged.
When you use Siri, your iPhone switches to this old screen UI obscuring your current
context. So this year we've completely redesigned the Siri experience with a new
compact design. It makes tasks like launching apps incredibly seamless.
For example if you say open Safari. Siri pops up the bottom of the screen and
instantly launches the App. Or if you ask for information like the weather results
appear at the top of the screen, just like a notiﬁcation. Now this is especially great
when there's information you want to reference on screen. For example, you could
ask Siri to add to your grocery list. So that's the new Siri design in iOS 14. But the UI is
only part of the story.
To tell you more about how we're making Siri smarter than ever, I'll hand it oﬀ to Yael
Garten.
{BIO 21510522 <GO>}
Thanks, Craig. Siri is getting smarter and even more helpful every day, and I'm really
excited to share the latest updates with you. Siri helps you in a ton of little ways
everyday, playing the morning news, ordering a coﬀee, getting directions, setting
the alarm before going to bed and so much more. In fact, Siri is helping so many of
you with a staggering 25 billion requests each month, and Siri is getting more
helpful every day.
Siri's always been great for getting information and now has over 20 times more
facts than just three years ago. For more complex questions like how do hybrid cars
work, or what causes seasons, we recently introduced answers from websites across
the Internet, enabling Siri to help you ﬁnd even more answers. Another way Siri
helps us with communication, like sending messages. This year, you can now ask Siri
to spend an audio message and Siri will start recording. This is great, when you really
want to have the emotion of your voice come through.
Another popular way to send messages with your voice is using dictation. Keyboard
dictation uses the same speech recognition as Siri. And leveraging the power of the
neural engine we are now able to run dictation on device. This provides great
accuracy and privacy. When communicating with someone in another language, Siri
can help with translations. This year we're expanding to support many new language
pairs. This is hugely popular, but we know our users want more than just translating
phrases.
They want to have entire conversations and we believe conversations between
languages should feel natural and easy and have the ability to stay private. That's
why we are introducing a new app called Translate. It is designed to be the best and
easiest to use app for conversations and it can work completely oﬄine, keeping your
conversations private. Using advanced on-device machine learning and the powerfulFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 6 of 35Craig Federighi
Stacey Lysikneural engine, you can translate your text and voice between any combination of
these 11 languages.
So I could have a conversation with someone in Mandarin and they could have a
conversation with someone in Russian. Just tap on the microphone and say, what are
your store hours? (foreign language) You get back the text and audio right away.
And just turn the phone to landscape to open conversation mode. We've designed a
side by side view that's easy for two people to know which side to follow in the
conversation. This mode is incredibly intuitive, with just a single microphone button
because the app intelligently detects the language spoken and shows translation on
the correct side of the screen.
Translate will make communicating between languages easier than ever before,
connecting people in new ways and we can't wait for you to try it.
{BIO 6190419 <GO>}
Thanks, Yael. Next up, messages. Messages is how many of us communicate with
people most important to us and now we're using it more than ever. Compared to
just a year ago we have a record number of users sending a record number of
messages and we've seen people use messages more and more to keep in touch
with their closest groups. This year, we're introducing a new way to stay connected
with your most important conversations giving you new ways to express your identity
with Memoji and making big changes to how we communicate in groups.
To tell you more, here is Stacey Lysik.
Thanks, Craig. First, let's get started with conversations. From the beginning,
messages was designed to make it really easy to get to your newest messages. With
so many active conversations, sometimes it can be tough to get to the ones that are
most important to you. So we are introducing a new way to let you stay connected to
your most important conversations, by letting you pin them at the top of your list, so
you can always get to them. And you can see messages as they come in with a
beautiful animation underpinned.
Next, let's talk about expressing yourself with the Memoji. There are over 1 trillion
ways to customize your identity with Memoji. In iOS 14 we're adding even more ways
to create your look, over 20 new hair and headwear styles to let you reﬂect your
hobby, obsession and personality. We've also added something that's even more
relevant today face coverings. And we're adding more age options too. My favorite
way of using Memoji is with Memoji stickers. And now we have three brand new
Memoji stickers that let you send a hug, a ﬁst bump, or even a blush to your friends.
Last let's chat about groups. When you're talking to a group sometimes there so
much going on it can be hard to keep track of the conversation. So this year we're
going to help you bring order to the chaos. First, we're adding in line replies that letFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 7 of 35Craig Federighi
Meg Frostyou apply directly to a speciﬁc message. You can view replies in the full conversation
or you can view them as their own thread. So you can focus in on the speciﬁc topic.
To make it even more clear who a message was met for we're introducing mentions.
With mentions, you can just type someone's name to direct a message to them. And
now you have the ability to only be notiﬁed when you're mentioned in the group
conversation. And check out the top of this conversation with an all-new design for
how groups appear. It lets you see all the members of your group, where the most
recently active people are shown largest. And for the ﬁrst time ever you can create a
unique visual identity for your group by setting a group photo, our customizing your
group's look with an Memoji.
Inside the conversation you see group member's photos around the image. Of
course it looks great as a pin. You know who's most recently commented in the
group because their photo will appear on the outside of the pin, and what's coming
to messages in iOS 14, all new pinned conversations, fun updates to Memoji and
powerful improvements to groups.
{BIO 6190419 <GO>}
Thanks, Stacy. Next, let's take a look at features that help us while we're out and
about. Now we know that life looks very diﬀerent for many of us right now. But it
won't always be this way. And as things start to open up, we have a new set of
features that will help us explore the world again, starting with maps. Apple Maps is
the best way to navigate and explore the world, all while protecting your privacy.
Over the past several years, we've added many great features and of course we've
been rebuilding our map from the ground up. Our new map ﬁnished rolling out
across the US earlier this year and brought with it better navigation and far richer
detail for roads, pedestrian pass, land cover and more. The new map also oﬀers
more accurate information for places and allows us to build incredible features like
look around. Maps has come a long way and people have noticed. Just look at this
quote from Fast Company, Apple Maps has improved by leaps and bounds and is a
formidable rival to Google Maps. It's also arguably got the better UI and by far, by far
the better privacy policy.
We're excited to announce we're bringing our new map to more countries later this
year, including the UK, Ireland and Canada. In addition to the rich detail and
improved accuracy the new map serves as the foundation for many great new
features. In iOS 14, we're adding things that will make it easier for people to ﬁnd
places they love and help them get to where they're going in ways that are better for
the environment. To tell you more, I'll hand it oﬀ to Meg Frost.
Thanks, Craig. First let's talk about ﬁnding great places. We've millions of ways [ph]
to discover great new places, whether they're planning their next big vacation or just
looking for something to eat nearby.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 8 of 35Craig FederighiIn iOS 14 the Maps team will be working with some of the world's most trusted
brands to oﬀer amazing guides; guides for great places to eat, shop, meet friends or
exploring cities around the world. You can save guides, you can easily get back to
them later and the best part is that they automatically update when new places are
added, so you always have the latest recommendations. In addition to helping you
discover great new places Maps help you get there in a way that's better for the
planet.
For years Map's made it easy to navigate using environmentally friendly options like
public transit and walking. With iOS 14 we're introducing great new features to help
our users reduce their carbon footprint, and our ﬁrst one is also our most requested,
it's cycling. We've done an cycling experience that helps
You get around town on your bike. We are adding a dedicated cycling option to
maps which allows users to ride their bike along bike lanes, pads and roads. Maps
takes elevation into account to let you know if you are in for a challenging whole [ph]
workout or a leisurely ﬂat ride.
You can also see if you are route includes quiet or busy roads. We even let you know
if you have a steep passage coming up or if you need to carry your bike up the stairs.
You can also choose to avoid stairs altogether. With iOS 14 we're bringing cycling to
New York City, LA, the San Francisco Bay Area, along with a number of cities in
China, like Shanghai and Beijing. And we'll be adding many more cities in the
coming months.
For environmentally conscious drivers we are also introducing EV routing. If you have
an electric car maps is going to help you eliminate range anxiety. With iOS 14 Maps
will track your current charge and factor in things like elevation and weather to
automatically add charging stops along your route. And Maps will know which type
of charger works for your car, making sure to only route you to compatible stations.
We are working with a number of manufacturers to support EV routing in their
vehicles, including BMW and Ford and we'll be adding many more in the near future.
Cities around the world are also working to improve air quality and reduce traﬃc. So
we're adding congestion and green zones to Maps to easily see where they are
along with alternate routing options. In addition, drivers in China can securely store
their license plate number on the iPhone and Maps will let them know which days
they can enter congested city centers based on that number. And those are just
some of the great new features coming to Apple Maps in iOS 14, making Maps the
best product to help users explore and navigate their world.

Thanks, Meg. And now on to CarPlay, which has transformed the driving experience
for iPhone owners by being a smarter, safer way to use the apps you love in your car.
CarPlay is everywhere and it's incredibly popular. Here in the US, it's available on
basically every new car. And worldwide, it's available on over 80% of new cars sold
and has quickly become the default in-car experience for so many people. PeopleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22

Craig Federighilove CarPlay and we get some really passionate reactions. Joanna Stern says it
makes her life inﬁnitely better. We have some great updates for iOS 14.
First up, we have new wallpaper options, perfect for the car, and we're adding
support for new categories of CarPlay apps, parking, EV charging and quick food
ordering. In addition to this, we're really excited for the next step in how we're
transforming your relationship with your car by rethinking car keys. They've been
around for over 100 years, but they become big, bulky and ripe for re-imagining. To
tell you more about what we have planned, let's go to the garage with Emily
Schubert.
{BIO 21736971 <GO>}
Thanks, Craig. I'm excited to introduce a digital version of car keys. Now you can
leave your keys at home and unlock and start your car with your iPhone. And the very
ﬁrst car to support this will be the new 2021 BMW 5 Series. Let me show you how it
works. It's super-simple. It uses NFC and you just tap to unlock. And I place my
phone on the charging pad and then push to start.
But this goes beyond just one less thing you have to keep in your pocket. Digital
keys have security beneﬁts. They live in a secure element of your iPhone and if it
goes missing you can turn oﬀ your keys remotely, via iCloud. They are even easier to
share than a physical key. Copies don't involve trips to the dealership. And you can
share from wherever you are with iMessage.
Let's give Craig a key so he can drive home after we're done here. With each key you
share, you can set options, like a restricted driving proﬁle, perfect for teen drivers,
which is tempting but we'll Craig full access.
{BIO 6190419 <GO>}
Full access. Thanks, Emily. The new BMW will be available to customers next month.
In addition to adding this feature in iOS 14, we're also enabling it in iOS 13, so
customers can use their car keys even sooner. Of course, we want this to work in any
car. So we've been working on standards with industry groups, and this is just the
beginning. We're working on technology to leverage our U1 chip which uses ultra-
wideband technology for precise spatial awareness. So you'll be able to leave your
iPhone in your bag or pocket and still securely unlock and start your car. We expect
to see support for this standard starting in new cars next year.
Now let's turn to the App Store. 12 years ago, we revolutionized the industry with the
launch of the App Store. Today, we have so many amazing apps that oﬀer a rich set
of experiences we can truly say that for everything we want to do, there is an app for
that. So now it's time for us to extend the success of the App Store and make apps
available and accessible in whole new ways.
What if you could have the right app you needed at just the right moment? Let's
look at what it would be like if you did.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22

An app clip is a small part of an app. It's a light and fast and easy to discover, so you
can quickly get what you need right when you need it. Everything about App clips is
designed for speed. They start with this card which quickly pops up and with just a
tap you can launch the App clip. You don't need to enter credit card numbers,
because App Cliﬀs can use Apple Pay for payments. And you don't have to manually
log into an account because it can take advantage of sign-in with Apple. App clips
won't clutter your home screen, and will only stay along as long as you need them.
But you could easily launch recently used app clips from the new app library. It's
always easy to download the full app and this makes App clips an easy way to
discover more of what the App Store has to oﬀer. And discovery is key. App clips are
all about getting to a part of an app at the moment you need it. So it was critical that
we made them really easy to ﬁnd. App clips can be easily discovered and launch
from the web.
You can launch app clips for messages when friends share them with you, when you
want to order takeout from a restaurant in Maps you can launch your app clip right
from a place card. You'll be able to tap on NFC tags out in the world on things like
parking meters or you can scan QR codes to launch App clips that work with
products you purchase. The best way to discover app clips will be with the new
Apple designed app clip code. So when you see one, you'll know that there is an
app clip waiting for you.
They incorporate both a visual code and NFC, so you tap on them or scan them with
the camera to bring up an app clip. App clips will be great for businesses that
already have apps. But we want to be able to use app clips everywhere, including
smaller spots that may not have their own app. So we made it possible for apps like
Yelp, which support multiple businesses to create App clip experiences for each of
the places they work with.
Developers will create app clips from a part of an app using X code and the full
power of the SDK. To ensure that they launch quickly, they'll need to be less than 10
megabytes in size, and that's App Clips, immediately discoverable, small in size, so
they launch fast, integrated Apple Pay for easy payment, sign in with Apple for quick
and privacy friendly login and the option to download the full app from the App
Store when you want to keep it around. We can't wait to see all the App clips
developers will create. And that's iOS 14.
It's a huge release that transforms the core experience of iPhone with redesigned
widgets right on the home screen and a new way to organize your apps with the app
library. It has incredible updates to some of the most popular apps with powerful
improvements to messages and maps and introduces a whole new way to tap into
apps with App clips.
And next up, iPad OS.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22

Okay. We've made it. All right, well, let's jump right in. iPad OS builds on all the
amazing features of IOS, while adding unique capabilities that deliver a distinct
experience for iPad, like using Apple pencil for taking notes, markup, an illustration,
a re-imagined trackpad experience that lets you interact with iPad in a whole new
way, and unmatched AR experiences with ARKit and the amazing new LiDAR Scanner
in iPad Pro. All of this combines to put iPad into a class of its own.
IPad excels at every type of input, and is a product to do anything and everything,
which brings us to this year and our new release iPadOS 14. Let's start with
experience. This year, iPadOS delivers unique made for iPad designs, that's a great
advantage of the iPad's large multi-touch display. The iPad has always been about
the apps.
In the beginning, we focused on giving the ecosystem of iPhone apps a larger
canvas to deliver new and unique experiences. This quickly sparked an entirely new
set of apps designed for iPad ﬁrst, with immersive experiences that transform this
magical sheet of glass into whatever you needed it to be. We're proud of the over 1
million apps on the App Store today designed just for iPad. With customers
continuing to push their iPads further than ever before, we're extending the design
language of iPad to make apps more streamlined and more powerful.
To give you a live look at these enhancements, I'll hand it over to Josh Shaﬀer.
Thanks, Craig. Let's take a look at some of the enhancements to iPad OS. The ﬁrst
you'll notice are the same redesigned widgets that you saw in iOS 14. They look
great on iPad as well, and they give you information at a glance whenever you go
home. But let's see some of the improvements in the apps, starting with photos.
IPad is the perfect device for browsing your photos. It's large canvas lets you
immerse yourself in all your favorite memories, and this year we're making it even
easier to browse and organize your photos with an all-new sidebar. With just a tap of
this button I can reveal the sidebar with all the core functionality of the app in a
single location. My photos remain front and center. But now I can quickly tap to
move between parts of the app. The sidebar is a really powerful way to organize
your photos to. I can easily drag a photo to the sidebar and then just drop it to add it
to an album.
We've brought this sidebar to many apps across iPadOS, like notes where it provides
quick and easy access to all your folders. And ﬁles where we've consolidated
navigation into the sidebar for a streamlined new design. We've also streamlined the
toolbars adding new drop down menus that consolidate functions into a single easy
to access button. I can just tap to change views like this. And for even quicker access
I can just tap and drag to change the sort order all in a single motion.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22

Page 12 of 35Craig FederighiYou'll ﬁnd the same approach across other apps like calendar, where we've brought
controls into a single toolbar at the top providing more space for your content and a
single uniﬁed place to access all the apps functionality. Finally music has been
updated to take even better advantage of iPad's large screen. The sidebar in music
makes it easy to move between views. I can quickly jump between the new listen
now in my playlists. And once I start playing a song, I can bring up the brand new full
stream player, where I can see rich album art, transport controls and lyrics all in one
single view.
And these are just some of the enhancements that are coming to Apps and iPad OS.

We're really loving these new app designs, but there is more. Starting with Siri, the
new compact Siri design that you heard about in iOS 14 is especially useful in iPad.
Results appear at the bottom right corner allowing you to easily reference the App
while using Siri.
And we applied the same approach to other parts of the experience, like calls. Now
today when you receive a call on iPad you see this. Whatever you were working on is
suddenly completely covered with the incoming call screen. Not cool. Wouldn't it be
nicer if instead, you saw this? That's much better. Now an incoming call is presented
with a compact notiﬁcation, that doesn't take you out of context. And you can simply
tap to answer or ﬂick it away to dismiss. And this applies to all calls, including those
from your iPhone or third party VOIP apps like Skype. And of course we're bringing
this to iOS as well.
We think our iPhone customers are going to love it. Now there is one more key
experience we've redesigned for iPad this year, and that's search. Today search is a
full screen experience, and sometimes you can lose track of your context. So we've
redesigned search with a new compact design. You can start a search from anywhere
like the home screen or over any app. And this makes it easy to ﬁnd what you need
without feeling like you've left the App you're working in.
But we didn't just redesign it. We've rebuilt search from the ground up, to be
universal, becoming a single destination where you can start all of your searches.
First, we made it better than ever as an app launcher. You just start typing a few
characters and you can instantly get to where you're going. It's also great for funding
contacts to message or call or documents. You can even search directly into apps
like keynote, messages, mail or ﬁles or look at information about people or places.
And it's also a great place to start all of your web searches as well.
As soon as you start typing you get relevant suggestions to complete your search
and you can get to your web search results with just a tap. And search now makes
navigating to your favorite websites, just as easy as launching an app. Just type a few
letters and then tap it will take you right to Safari. So those are some of our updates
to the iPad experience and of course you get the new widgets and all the other great
App enhancements from iOS 14.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22

Page 13 of 35Jenny ChenNext, we want to push forward your ability to express yourself creatively, with
improvements to Apple Pencil. Apple Pencil is a game changing tool that turns iPad
into a professional drawing canvas, a great way to mark up and sign documents and
the ultimate note taking device. What many people love most about taking notes
with Apple pencil is how they can express themselves in a free form way. Mixing
handwriting and drawings can be the best way to capture your thoughts. Now the
challenge is, when you want to change things afterwards. Here working with
handwriting just isn't as easy as with typed text.
Now we sometimes take it for granted, but with typed text it's so easy to select, copy
and paste into another document or even just make space for more text. Well, this
year we're going to make handwriting just easy and just as powerful, but that's not
all. Our customers tell us that, once they have an Apple pencil in their hand, they
don't want to put it away. So this year we're bringing Scribble to iPad. So you can
hand write into any text ﬁeld and it will automatically be converted to text.
To show you all of this in action, I'd like to welcome Jenny Chen for a live demo.
{BIO 20335880 <GO>}
Thanks, Craig. I'm really excited to show you some of the great new features that we
have for Apple Pencil and iPadOS this year. One of the great parts about taking
notes with the Apple Pencil is that it really let you work in a free form way. I can just
start writing anywhere. And it's not just about text. I can also express myself with
drawings or sheets, but sometimes you want that more professional cleaned up look
and so now when I draw a simple shape and pause at the end it'll automatically
convert to that ideal shape. And we're smart about it, retaining the same size, an
angle that you drew it at.
In addition to shapes, we've also made huge improvements to our handwriting
recognition. So now when I write I can easily make a selection using the same
gestures that I use for type text. I can double tap to select a word or double tap
again to select a line. Thanks to our advanced on-device machine learning you'll
notice, how we can ﬂex the handwriting, while avoiding the drawings nearby.
Now that I have the selection I can easily change the color or move it around the
document. It's also perfectly easy for me to make space for more room to write. We
think that this will make note taking with Apple Pencil even better, and now you don't
even have to put it down when you want to do something else.
Let's say you want to search for Edison bulbs, in Safari. Using Scribble, I can just write
directly into the text ﬁeld. And it automatically gets converted to typed text. It also
works in any tax ﬁeld. So I can easily add a new reminder to my shared reminders list
with my husband. I've also been learning Chinese. So I want to surprise him with
some of my progress and skills. I use scratch and delete light. And then I can use
Scribble to write new, and then light ﬁxture in Chinese. You'll notice how Scribble
recognizes both English and Chinese, in the same line.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22

Mary-Ann IonascuAnd this also means that we can build on this technology to deliver other great
features like data detectors. We can automatically detect what you write, like phone
numbers, so I can make a phone call or addresses, so I can look up directions. We
can use these features together to do even more with your handwriting. Let's say I
want to use my handwriting in another app. I can easily select what I want. Tap the
new copy of text from the call up bar and then paste it into an app like Pages and it's
automatically converted to typed text.
We're really excited about these awesome new features that we'll think will let you
do even more with the Apple Pencil.
{BIO 6190419 <GO>}
Thanks, Jenny. So those are the enhancements to pencil. Just one part of an amazing
release with Scribble for handwriting into any text ﬁeld, a whole new way to work
with your hand written notes, broad enhancements to the app experience and of
course iPad users also beneﬁt from the great features you already saw in iOS 14 and
much more that we didn't have time to talk about. So that's iOS and iPadOS.
Next, let's talk about AirPods. From the one click set up to the automatic pairing with
all your devices, to how they pause your audio when you take them out, people love
the magical experience that AirPods deliver. Now we're bringing even more magic
to AirPods. To tell you all about it, here's Mary-Ann Ionascu.
Thanks, Craig. We have some amazing updates coming to AirPods, starting with
automatic switching. AirPods will now seamlessly move between their devices
without you having to manually switch them. Let's say you just ﬁnished listening to a
podcast and you pick up your iPad to watch a show. AirPods will magically
switchover and later you start a video conference on your mac. AirPods will
automatically switch again. And if a phone call comes in, the audio in your AirPods
route will right back to your phone. We also have an exciting new feature coming to
AirPods Pro, spatial audio.
You know the experience of being in a movie theater with a state-of-the-art surround
sound system, one where the sound not only comes from in front of you, but also
from the left, the right, behind and even from above you. Well, we are thrilled to
bring that same immersive experience to AirPods Pro. But it turns out, it's a lot harder
to do when you only have a single ear bud in each year. So our team created
advanced spatial audio algorithms for AirPods Pro that replicate the movie theater
experience.
By applying directional audio ﬁlters and suddenly adjusting the frequencies each ear
receives we can play sounds virtually anywhere in space, creating an immersive
surround sound experience. But to truly deliver on this promise, we had to factor in
real life situations. First people move their heads. For an authentic surround soundFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 15 of 35Craig Federighi
Kevin Lynchexperience, you need the sound ﬁeld to stay ﬁxed. So the voice feels like it's coming
from the actor and not some random point in space.
So we used the accelerometer and gyroscopes in AirPods Pro to track the motion of
your head remapping the sound ﬁeld so it stays anchored to your device even as
your head moves. And it's not only your head that can move, but you might move
your iPad or iPhone as well. That's why we constantly compare the motion data from
your head and your screen, to understand how they're moving in relation to each
other.
So if your bus turns the corner or your plane banks the sound stays in sync. The
result is the surround sound experience that keeps you in the middle of the action,
no matter where you go. Special audio for AirPods Pro will work with content
encoded in 5.1, 7.1 and even Dolby Atmos.
{BIO 6190419 <GO>}
Thanks Mary-Ann. I've been using the new spatial audio and I think you're all really
going to love it. All right. Next, let's head to the ﬁtness center to hear the latest on
watchOS from Kevin.

{BIO 1958128 <GO>}
Thanks Craig. Since we launched Apple Watch, it's completely redeﬁned what a
watch can do, and this has been incredibly meaningful work. Apple Watch not only
helps you stay connected and active, it's become an intelligent guardian of your
health, enabling you to take an ECG, detect falls and call emergency services for you.
It's impacting lives in ways that were inconceivable ﬁve years ago.
The power of Apple Watch is not only its built-in features, but how developers have
personalized it for you. We introduced the App Store and watchOS 6 and there are
now over 20,000 watchOS apps available. These apps bring the information you
care about most, through just a glance at your watch face. And we're taking this even
further in watchOS 7, starting with complications.
Until today an app could appear only once part of the time on a watch face. In
watchOS 7 developers can enable multiple complications, making even more richly
personal watch faces. So if you'd like to use Dawn Patrol for surﬁng, you can create
your own surf watch including water, temperature, swell and wind speed predictions
for your favorite beach. Or new parents can use Glow Baby to see nap, changing and
feeding times all in one phase, while Nike run club can display stats like pace from
your last run and your weekly run goals.
We're also bringing rich complications to more phases, including a fresh
chronograph phase with an integrated tech emitter and an updated extra-large faceFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 16 of 35Julz Arneywith a huge rich complication, right in the center. And conﬁguring watch faces has
been redesigned, so you can easily select which information you'd like to see. As
developers with watchOS 7, you can now build your rich complications with native
SwiftUI.
While there are so many ways to conﬁgure watch faces, you may not have gone in
and set these up for yourself yet. That's okay. With watchOS 7, we're making it super
easy to share watch faces. So you can discover a phase that works perfectly for you.
To do this, we're introducing face sharing. You'll be able to discover curated faces
with third-party apps on the App Store or discover a favorite watch face right on our
website., or receive watch faces directly from friends and family.
Let's take a look at how this works. When you see a watch face you like, you just
press, add up a watch face. If the watch face uses some apps that you don't have yet,
you will be oﬀered each one right here, so you can easily get them if you like. And
the new face appears right on your watch. If you'd like to share a face you've created
yourself that's also really easy. Just long press on the face, tap share, pick a contact
and send. Developers can oﬀer pre-conﬁgured watch faces right from their apps.
You can even share watch faces across social media. It's a great way for the
community of Apple Watch wearers to connect and help each other discover all the
amazing things Apple Watch is capable of.
Next, let's talk about Maps. Maps is great for walking, driving and transit directions.
And now in watchOS just like in iOS 14, you can get cycling directions. You'll see a
variety of routes with information like time, distance and whether there are bike
lanes. You can preview travel time, and elevation changes and navigate with turn by
turn directions that are large and easy to read. Maps can direct you to dismount and
walk your bike or even take the stairs to save time. You can also search for and add
places optimized for cyclists, like bike repair shops.
Now to tell you about how we're advancing workouts, please welcome Julz Arney.
Thanks, Kevin. The workout app uses algorithms that are smartly tuned to track all
aspects of your training. It's one of the most used apps on Apple Watch and we've
continued to add support for new workout types every year. And in watchOS 7, we're
adding dance. Dance is a total body workout that's great for your heart. It makes you
more ﬁt and ﬂexible and you're guaranteed to have fun.
Whether you're doing hip-hop, Latin, Bollywood or simply cardio dance, the workout
app now tracks some of the world's most popular styles of dance for ﬁtness. Getting
the most accurate credit for dance represented a unique challenge. Our movements
aren't always repetitive or synchronized leg movements, like in running and walking.
The solution was to use advanced sensor fusion. In dance, we combine data from the
accelerometer and the gyroscope to detect the diﬀerence between dancing with just
your arms, just your lower body or when you put it altogether and dance with yourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22

Vera Carrentire body. Then we add in heart rate data for the most accurate calorie burned
calculation.
WatchOS 7 also tracks accurate calories for core training, those exercises for your abs
and back. Functional strength training, a workout type that helps you get stronger
and move better for everyday activities, and also Cooldown to add on to another
workout when you want to continue with easy moves and stretches as you bring your
heart rate and breathing back to normal. Of course, you can track your progress for
any of these new workouts inside the activity app on iPhone which is completely
redesigned in watchOS 7.
The app now features the new summary tab that gives you an easy way to see your
activity history, workouts and trend all in one screen with you. With the new focus on
easy navigation and summary metrics, the App is getting a new name as well,
Fitness.
Back to you, Kevin.
{BIO 1958128 <GO>}
Thanks, Julz. Apple Watch helps you meet not only your ﬁtness goals, but also helps
support your health, with features such as cycle tracking, the breathe app and noise
notiﬁcations. And we're going to be adding even more capabilities this year in
watchOS 7. We'd like to share a couple of them with you today, starting with one of
the most requested features for Apple Watch, tracking your sleep. To tell you about
this, over to Vera Carr.
{BIO 21858302 <GO>}
Thanks, Kevin. There are many ways to look at sleep. Scores, advanced monitoring or
sleep cycle analysis. We are taking more holistic approach to sleep by leveraging the
devices you use everyday to not only track your sleep, but to support you and
actually meeting your sleep duration goal. That's also choosing not only when you
would like to wake up in the morning, but also when you would like to go to bed.
For most of us, setting a goal is easy, but getting to bed on time, that's the hard part.
Experts say that establishing a bedtime routine helps the body transition from
wakefulness to sleep. So we are oﬀering wind down. It can help you get to bed on
time by minimizing distractions and creating a personalized routine. Let's look at
how this works.
In the evening ahead of your bedtime, your phone can display the wind down
screen to help you transition mentally before you go to bed. It creates the calm lock
screen experience and turns on do not disturb for you. You can also setup shortcuts
for simple things you may like to do to help you prepare for bed. These might
include using your favorite meditation app or playing relaxing music. Once it's time
for bed, your screen will dim and your watch will go in to sleep mode, which looks
like this.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 18 of 35Kevin Lynch
Craig FederighiThe screen will be oﬀ during time of bed, so it won't bother you and a tap displays
this simple face. When it's time to wake up, you have a selection of gentle and
eﬀective alarm sounds or a silent tactic only wake up, alarm, so you don't disturb
your partner. Once you're up, you'll see a friendly greeting easing you into the day. It
also shows you battery level, so you can remember to charge in the morning.
Apple Watch tracks your sleep using a machine learning model that senses your
motion and even interprets the micro movements caused by the rise and fall of your
breath, providing signals for when you're awake and when you're sleep. There is an
updated sleep section in health app including a view of your trends over time. Sleep
schedules, wind down and sleep mode are also available on iPhone without a Watch
in iOS 14. We know you'll enjoy using Watch throughout the day and now throughout
the night.
{BIO 1958128 <GO>}
Thanks, Vera. In addition to sleep keeping your healthy there's another preventative
care item that's so important particularly now, hand washing. In watchOS 7 Apple
Watch is the ﬁrst watch to deliver automatic detection when you start washing your
hands and sensing of how long you actually wash. Our approach here is using
machine learning models to determine motion, which appears to be hand-washing
and then use audio to conﬁrm the sound of running water or squishing soap on your
hands.
During this you'll get a little coaching to do a good job, you'll see a countdown
along with haptics and sounds to make sure you wash as long as you're supposed to.
If you pause early, there is a plate note to keep washing. And when you're done
you'll see here and feel it. That's just some of what's coming this year in watchOS 7
including discovering and sharing faces, new workout types, sleep and hand-
washing detection and other new capabilities like Siri language translation.
And that's Apple Watch. It's time for you to join Craig again to talk about something
that's important to all of us. Here We go.

At Apple we believe privacy is a fundamental human right. So we build it into our
products from the beginning of the design process. Privacy matters now more than
ever, and because our devices contain the most sensitive information, all of our
product work is grounded in a set of privacy principles.
First, data minimization. We use innovative technologies and techniques to minimize
the personal data we or anyone else can access. Second on-device intelligence. We
avoid data collection by processing as much of your information on your device as
we can, rather than sending it to a server. Third, security, security protections are
foundational to everything we do in privacy. And ﬁnally transparency and control. ItFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22

Katie Skinner
Erik Neuenschwanderhelps you better understand the data being collected so that you can make your
own choices about how that data is used.
These principles come together across our products, in our hardware, our software
and our services. At the end of the day they result in great privacy and great ease of
use. A powerful example of this is sign-in with Apple, which is designed for
simplicity, security and privacy and since we launched it last year users have created
over 200 million accounts across a wide variety of apps and websites. And
developers are seeing great usage when they adopt it.
For example, Kayak has integrated with sign-in Apple and found that their users are
now two times more likely to use it then any other sign-in provider. Now one thing
we hear a lot with sign-in with Apple is that people wish they could convert their
existing accounts to use it. So this year we're going to enable developers to let you
do just that. When you upgrade you get the ease of use and built-in security of sign-
in with Apple while keeping the account that you already have.
This is another big year of privacy improvements in our products and to tell you
more, here's Katie Skinner and Erik Neuenschwander.
Thanks, Craig. First let's talk about location. This year we're continuing to give you
even more control. In addition to the option of sharing your precise location, you
have the option to only share your approximate location with us.
We're also making changes for mic and camera, so you always know when you're
recording. In addition to requiring your permission this year, we're adding more
visibility for current or recent mic or camera use. So if an app uses either one we will
indicate that in the status bar.
Next, let's talk about tracking. Safari's intelligent tracking prevention has been really
successful on the web and this year we want to help you with tracking in apps. We
believe tracking should always be transparent and under your control. So moving
forward App Store policy will require apps to ask before tracking you across apps
and websites owned by other companies.
Last, let's talk about app privacy. Today we require that apps have a privacy policy.
Wouldn't it be great to even more quickly and easily see a summary of an apps
privacy practices before you download it. Now where we've seen something like that
before? For Food you have nutrition labels. You can see if it's packed with protein or
loaded with sugar or maybe both, all before you buy it. So we thought it would beFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22

of data on you or a lot of data, or if they're sharing data with other companies to
track you and much more.
We're going to put this information on product pages in the App Store. So for each
app, you can see highlights of their privacy information before you download it and
we're going to include this in all of our App Stores. Back over to you, Craig.
{BIO 6190419 <GO>}
Thanks Katie and Erik. These are some of the ways we're strengthening the privacy of
our platforms and bringing new features to give users even more control. And one of
the places where privacy matters most is your home. Like most of you in the past few
months, I've spent more time at home than I ever imagined. It's more clear than ever
just how important it is to live in a home where the technology just works. And that
brings us to some great new features we're bringing to the home this year.
All of these features share few key attributes. First, anything we developed for the
home should be easy, from initial setup to everyday use. Just like how tap of your
iPhone can automatically conﬁgure an Apple TV. Second, home products should
never compromise your privacy. That's why your Siri request use a random identiﬁer,
not your Apple ID. And ﬁnally your devices should all work better together, like how
AirPlay lets your share from your iPhone straight to the TV.
And when things are easy, private and work together seamlessly your home is more
enjoyable. Whether you're watching TV, listening to music or getting the most out of
your smart devices. To tell you more about what we have in store for the home, let
me pass it to Yah Cason.
Thanks, Craig. Let's start by talking about the smart home. With HomeKit, we've
given developers a robust framework to create smart home accessories that are
remarkably easy to set up, all while being end-to-end encrypted to your Apple
devices. Already there is a risk ecosystem of devices available, but we want to make
it even easier to build products that work across more homes. So we formed an
alliance and partnered with Amazon, Google and other industry leaders to deﬁne a
new interoperability standards for the smart home. We open sourced HomeKit to
ensure ease of use and privacy are core to this eﬀort.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 21 of 35Cindy LinAnd any accessory using HomeKit or this new standard will work incredibly well
across all your Apple devices and you control it all in the home app, the most secure
way to manage your smart home. Adding new devices to your home has never been
easier. Simply tap or scan to set up an accessory, and in iOS 14 after you add an
accessory, the home app will now suggest useful automations so you can
immediately put a new device to work for you.
Automations are rules that set your homes to autopilot, like automatically time on
your porch lights when motion is detected, or having the garage door open as you
arrive home. And now when you open the home app you'll see a new visual status
right at top that prioritize the accessories which most need your attention. You can
easily see if you left the door unlocked, or the lights on and quickly control them.
Let's take a closer look to one of the most popular categories of HomeKit
accessories, lights. Millions of us have already added smart bulbs to our homes,
many of which can change color on demand. In iOS 14, we're introducing a feature
to help you get the most out of those bulbs, adaptive lighting. Adaptive lighting
automatically adjusts the color temperature of your lights throughout the day, turn it
on to ease into the morning with warm colors, stay focused and alert mid-day with
cooler ones and wind down at night by reducing blue light. Adaptive lighting
ensures you get the right color at the right time.
Another popular smart home category is cameras. With HomeKit secure video, your
cameras are completely private. And in iOS 14 we're making your cameras work even
harder for you. You will be able to deﬁne activity zones that focus on the most
important areas. This is great if you face a busy sidewalk and only want to be alerted
when people actually walk up to your front door.
Another powerful feature we're bringing to cameras is face recognition. HomeKit
cameras and video doorbells will now provide even richer notiﬁcations telling you,
who's thereby leveraging the friends and family you already tagged in your photos
apps. And face recognition extends the HomePod announcing who is at the door.
And with Apple TV, you'll get a live view whenever someone rings the bell.
In fact all your HomeKit enabled cameras will be directly integrated with tvOS 14 so
you can quickly bring them up in the new Home View and Control Center or just ask
Siri to ﬂip any camera at any time. You can even take any camera full screen to give
you a great view of what's going on. And we have even more coming to tvOS 14.
Now, let me pass it to Cindy Lin to tell you about it.

You can even have an AirPlay session show up in a picture in picture window. And
AirPlay is getting even better. Now the whole family can share their stunning videos
captured on iPhone in their full 4K resolution. With videos, music, games and more,
Apple TV truly oﬀer something for everyone. Of course, nothing compares to be
encaptivated by good story. And we've built a service for just that, Apple TV+. We've
already created an incredible lineup of Apple originals and you can watch them all in
the Apple TV app, which is available on your favorite Apple devices and all major
streaming boxes and many popular smart TVs. It's already reaching over a 1 billion
screens and it's coming to Sony and Vizio's smart TVs later this summer.
Today, we're really excited to tell you about a new Apple TV+ original that we're
working on. Almost 70 years ago, Isaac Asimov introduced the world to a series of
epic novels that span hundreds of world and thousands of years. Many consider it to
be the best science ﬁction series of all time. I would like to share a sneak peek with

can only be answered by Apple's legendary crack marketing team. Their drug-fueled
mini driven vision quest have yielded some great names and sadly spawned a host
of imitators. The truth is, we can't responsibly continue to inadvertently lead our
competition to copy of these methods when they clearly can't handle the trip. So this
year, we're leaving our process shrouded in mystery and taking you straight to the
glorious destination.
Our next release of macOS is macOS Big Sur. macOS Big Sur introduces an entirely
new design and major updates to some of the most essential apps on the platform.
And just like its name, Big Sur brings you unmatched levels of power and beauty.
Let's start with design, where we're making the biggest change since the
introduction of macOS X. To tell you more about the philosophy and incredible
craftsmanship behind the new design, here's a short video with Alan Dye.
{BIO 19177610 <GO>}
At Apple design has always been about great ideas. Those ideas, then are
developed with this obsessive dedication to detail. If we care enough about all the
details and make our products then in the end we will design an experience that
really feels like there's no other way to be. And the best example of this is macOS
Big Sur.
Our goal was to bring even more clarity to the design of the software, while retaining
the mac's powerful capabilities and ease of use. We started with the simplest
developments from the shape of the corner radius to reﬁnements in buttons and
controls. And we brought our uniﬁed language of symbols to the mac making it
more consistent and easier to recognize. Depth, shading and translucency are used
to create hierarchy. These new materials are rich and they are vibrant. They bridge
light and dark. We've reduced the visual complexity to keep the focus on users
content.
Buttons and controls appear when you need them and they recede when you don't.
There's a new way to access system level controls and a uniﬁed space for
notiﬁcations and widgets. We've also created a new suite of sounds that are familiar
to the mac but remastered and more reﬁned. We wanted consistency throughout the
ecosystem, so users can move ﬂuidly between their Apple devices. But we also love
the mac icon to have a deep history and a distinct look and feel. So we retained
many of the highly crafted details and the playful elements that make mac icon's
unique.
This OS reﬂects an important history. It's familiar but it's also entirely new in every
detail. We love the mac, is the tool we use to make all the products that we put out
into the world and macOS Big Sur is where it starts.

Page 24 of 35So that's the thinking behind our new design. Now, let me show it to you in action
with a demo.
As Alan said we've reﬁned some of the most iconic elements of the mac experience.
Let's start with the dock. It has its elegant new design that ﬂoats along the bottom of
your desktop. And you'll notice that we've created gorgeous new app icons for all of
your favorite apps.
Speaking of apps, let's take a look at the ﬁnder. You noticed it has a gorgeous new
top to bottom design for the side bar and it has a compact space-eﬃcient toolbar,
makes it really easy to get to all of your controls. Next, let's take a look at mail. You
can see that mail has all new gliﬀs [ph] in the sidebar and you may have noticed that
we brought color back as well. Now each app uses its own key color and that same
colors use the elegant new rounded low selection style here in the message list.
Now the toolbar makes it really easy to get to all your controls. Check out how the
search bar expands as I click on it. And of course other operations like ﬁltering, they
are just a click away. Next let's take a look at photos. It's just stunning. You can get to
all your albums and media types from the sidebar and the photo grid is backed by
metal so animations are super smooth, whether I'm scrolling, transitioning or
zooming all the way in or all the way out, beautiful.
Now we've refreshed the design for all the apps on the system. From apps like
calendar and notes to podcast and music with its new listen now pane. And an new
version of iWork that features a simpliﬁed toolbar. You may have noticed we've also
updated the menu bar. It's now translucent, and elegantly takes on the color of your
desktop picture.
And we've updated the layout of menus as well. We've given all the items just a little
bit more room to breathe.
Now on the mac we love our ability to get directly at controls like Wi-Fi or sound, and
you can see that we've reworked these to be even more useful, but we've gone even
further this year by giving you one place to get at all your controls. We've brought
Control Center to the mac. All of my controls are here and it's really easy to make
adjustments. For instance I can change display brightness here, or I can click to dive
in for more, like turning on dark mode or activating night shift. And what's really cool
is that I can customize the menu bar with any of these controls.
So say I want one click access to do not disturb. Well I can just click and drag it right
into my menu bar and customize just like that. Now we've also reinvented
Notiﬁcation Centre. You can access it by clicking on the time in the upper right and
as you see we now have a single view that brings your notiﬁcations and widgets
together all in one place.
We now group related notiﬁcations together. You can easily expand them to take a
closer look or clear them all out in one step and we're bringing our redesignedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 25 of 35widgets to the mac. They're really beautiful. And you have all new ways to customize
them. I'm just going to click edit widgets down here at the bottom. You can see I
have a gallery of all my widget and they come in a variety of sizes. I can select
between them just like this and developers can bring their own widgets as well, like
this one here from day one.
Now adding widgets is easy. Let's start by adding say the world clock, maybe I'll add
notes in, and it will be kind of cool to add my reminders list as well. So that's a look
at widgets Notiﬁcation Centre and our all-new design in Big Sur. Next there are
exciting updates for some of the most used apps on the mac. First, let's talk about
messages. Messages on the mac is designed to work seamlessly with all of your
devices. So your SMS and iMessage conversations are in sync, no matter what device
you're using.
Now this year, we're taking messages to the next level with a ton of great new
features. We're introducing powerful search to help you ﬁnd what you're looking for.
We have a redesigned photo picker to make sharing photos and videos easier, and
Memoji. You can now create and edit your Memoji right on your mac. And Memoji
stickers bring personality to messages giving you fun ways to express yourself in all
of your conversations. Messages aﬀects, helps you celebrate special moments and
get your point across and you're also getting pinned conversations that are synced
across devices, so you can always get to them, along with new groups
enhancements. So that's what's coming to messages on mac, powerful tools to
manage your conversations and new ways to express yourself.
Next app, Maps. Apple Maps is the best way to explore and navigate the world,
whether you're planning a trip on the mac or using turn-by-turn directions on your
iPhone. Today, I'm excited to announce an all new version of maps for the mac. To
start, maps features a stunning new design that makes it easy to ﬁnd your way
around using Apple's detailed new map. And for the ﬁrst time in the mac, favorites,
like home, work and that great coﬀee shop in the corner are now just a click away.
You can now create your own guides for all the places you want to visit right on your
mac. And before leaving for the airport, you can check where you're gate is located
with indoor maps or explore your destination city with look around which is
incredible on the big screen.
We've even brought other useful features to the mac, like the ability to see the
progress of friends, who shared their ETA with you. And the mac gets all the other
new maps features we just introduced in iOS 14. And that's just a taste of what's
coming in the all-new Apple Maps on the mac.
Next, let's talk about Mac Catalyst. Catalyst gives developers, a big head start in
creating a mac App from an iPad app. Take for instance our recent release of Swift
Playgrounds for Mac Catalyst gave us a big head start creating the App and we were
able to spend our development time crafting a great mac experience.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 26 of 35Today, we have some improvements to Mac Catalyst I'd like to share. This year,
developers will be able to optimize their apps to fully utilize the native resolution of
the mac screen, providing total control of every pixel. We've also given developers
new capabilities, including powerful new menu and keyboard APIs and updated
controls like check boxes and date pickers. They look great with the new design in
macOS.
In fact, we use catalyst with the new version of maps and just as you'd expect, it's a
full-ﬂedged mac App that runs natively and is designed in a way that's true to the
mac. So you get multiple re-sizable windows, keyboard shortcuts and everything else
you'd expect from a native mac App. And we did the same thing for messages. Maps
and messages joined the great set of apps from Apple that already use the Mac
Catalyst technology. And there is a growing list of third-party catalyst apps available
on the mac App Store.
Next, Safari. Our users love Safari for its speedy performance, power eﬃciency and
state of the art privacy protections and it delivers all of that while making it easy to
get your bookmarks, tabs and browsing history across all of your devices. This year,
we're building on Safari's amazing performance, elegant design and pioneering
privacy protections to deliver the biggest update to Safari, since it was ﬁrst
introduced.
As you know, Safari has long been the world's fastest desktop browser. This year,
Safari is performance running JavaScript is better than ever and continues to
signiﬁcantly outpace all other major browsers. And now, when it comes to page
loading, we're even faster there too. In fact when loading frequently visited websites,
Safari is now in average more than 50% faster than Chrome, and Safari delivers this
amazing performance while continuing to deliver industry-leading battery life. And
of course Safari is continuing to build on its pioneering track record of protecting
user privacy.
Safari was the ﬁrst browser to introduce private browsing, cookie blocking and most
recently intelligent tracking prevention. This year, we want to give our users even
more visibility into how each site they visit tries to track them and the ways that Safari
protects them. So now users can click on the privacy report button in the toolbar
when they visit a site to better understand how that site is treating their privacy.
In addition to monitoring unwanted tracking, Safari now also securely monitors your
saved passwords to ensure that they haven't been compromised in a data breach.
And this is also a big year for extensions in Safari. We're adding support for the web
extensions API, so developers can easily bring over extensions that they've built for
other browsers. And we're building an all new category in the Mac app store to
showcase Safari extensions so users can easily ﬁnd them. Now extensions are very
powerful but can introduce privacy challenges.
In other browsers, extensions can access every page you visit, every tab you open,
even everything you type. So we're doing even more here. In Safari, you chooseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 27 of 35Beth Dakinwhich sites each extension can work with. And you can even give them access just
for the day, just for the website or all the time, but improved performance, power
eﬃciency and privacy protections are only the start. We have a whole slew of new
features this year from a customizable start page to redesigned tabs that are more
elegant and powerful and native translation capabilities built right in the Safari.
To tell you more, I'll hand it oﬀ to Beth Dakin.
Thanks, Craig. I'm so excited to give you a tour of the brand new Safari. When you
open Safari, right away, you'll notice the new-look. It's clean and fresh. I want to show
you one of my favorite new features the customizable start page. I love it, because I
can make it my own. It's easy to get to the customization controls here in the bottom
corner.
We think a lot of people are going to want to set a background image and there is a
beautiful Gallery of curated wallpapers to choose from. You can use one of your own
photos too and I know I want a photo of my son. I have a few really cute ones here in
the downloads. I can just drag and drop to set it. That is so perfect.
You can add new sections to the start page too. Let's add iCloud tabs and reading
list. Let's take a look. There, this is perfect. I use reading lists all the time and now it's
so easy to get to. Another way that you can dial in Safari to your speciﬁc needs is
with extensions. I can't wait for you developers to bring your web extensions to
Safari. I've gone ahead and downloaded a few web extensions to take a peek. So
let's go here to the Safari preferences to enable them. And I'll enable Power
Thesarus and Recipe Filter. So each of the extensions that I just enabled now has its
own button here in the toolbox.
Let me show you Recipe Filter. I love this one. So this extension will search the web
page for a recipe and it ﬁnds line it will pop up in a little card. It's been a great
accelerator for me when I'm building a grocery list. So the extension hasn't done
anything yet because I haven't granted permission. So let me click on the toolbar
button and I'm going to allow this extension for one day. And when I click here it will
do its thing. So here we go. And there it is. So useful. Okay, so I have my personality,
pretty thoroughly stamped over Safari at this point. And you know I use Safari for a
lot of personal things. And Apple makes sure my private life stays private. Privacy is
essential to everything we do at Apple and it's critical on the web. And now you can
see what Safari is doing to protect you.
If I click on the intelligent tracking prevention button, I can see the number of known
trackers that Safari protected me from on this web page. I can click here to see a list
of the known trackers right here in this pop over and the full privacy report is just
one click away. And that's what we have for privacy in the new Safari.
Next I'd like to talk about Tabs. If you love tabs, you're going to love the new safari.
It's easier and more eﬃcient than ever to work with lots of tabs. So I have anotherFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 28 of 35Craig Federighi
Tim Cookwindow here and right away, you'll notice that there are icons and tabs which makes
it so easy to spot what you're looking for. And if I open more tabs, then you'll see
more of them at once, because the tabs get smaller and uses the space more
eﬃciently. If it's a little hard to ﬁnd what you're looking for with this many tabs, that's
no problem, you can just hover over tabs and see a nice preview of the page.
I'm ready to clean up now and that's easy too. I can just bring up the context menu
here and close all tabs to the right just like that. We are so excited that the new Safari
has built in translation. Let me show you.
So here on this website on El Mundo Safari has detected that this is not my primary
language and it's added the translation icon to the smart search ﬁeld. I can click here
and let's translate this page to English. It will happen in line and as more content is
added that gets translated dynamically too. So these are some highlights, but there
are so much more to the new Safari.
Back to you, Craig.
{BIO 6190419 <GO>}
Thanks, Beth. So that's Safari. It's a huge release with new ways to customize, big
improvements to your browsing experience like tabs and translation and even
stronger privacy protection to keep your browsing, your business. And that's macOS
Big Sur, the biggest update to design since the original introduction of macOS X,
signiﬁcant updates to messages and maps and the biggest update to Safari ever. But
these changes are only the beginning. For years now down deep below the surface
we've been working on something truly profound.
To tell you more, I'll hand it back to Tim.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
Thanks, Craig. Big Sur is going to be a great release of macOS. But that's only part of
the story, because today is going to be a truly historic day for the mac. Today, we're
going to tell you about some really big changes, how we're going to take the mac to
a whole new level. From the very beginning, the mac redeﬁned the entire computer
industry. The mac has always been about innovation and boldly pushing things
forward, embracing big changes to stay at the forefront of personal computing.
The mac has had three major transitions in its history. The move to PowerPC, the
transition to macOS X and the move to Intel. And now it's time for a huge leap
forward for the mac. Because today is the day we are announcing that the mac is
transitioning to our own Apple silicone. When we make bold changes, it's for one
simple yet powerful reason. So we can make much better products. When we look
ahead, we envision some amazing new products and transitioning to our own
custom silicon is what will enable us to bring them to live.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22

That's what makes our products so great and silicon is at the heart of our hardware.
So having a world-class silicon design team is a game changer. To tell you more
about Apple's silicon and how it will take mac to the next level, I'd like to send you
over to Johny Srouji at one of our labs in an undisclosed location.
(Video Presentation)
{BIO 19052877 <GO>}
Welcome to our lab. We've been building on reﬁning our Apple silicon for over a
decade. The result is a scalable architecture that is custom designed for Apple
products and it leads the industry in features and performance per watt. So I'd love
to tell you how we got here and what it means for the mac moving forward.
It all started with the iPhone. The iPhone demanded performance and capabilities
that were seen as impossible in a device that small. This is why we developed our
relentless focus on performance per watt. Generation after generation, we pushed
the boundaries of technology which enabled us to improve performance and energy
eﬃciency while building advanced and industry leading features. Our team
delivered 10 generations of increasingly complex enriched designs, always
improving performance.
In fact CPU performance in the iPhone has improved by over a 100 times, keeping
the iPhones performance ahead of every other phone in the industry. Another
opportunity for the team was the iPad. While iPhone chips could dive our midstream
iPads, we wanted to push the iPad even further. It begun with the iPad's Retina
display which demanded a custom chip. So the team's scaled our architecture and
designed the most optimized and highest performance chip possible for the iPad,
starting with A5X we built a line of SoCs speciﬁcally designed for the iPad.
We doubled the iPhone's graphics performance through a larger GPU and a wider
memory subsystem. This was the iPad in a class by itself. Compared to the very ﬁrst
iPad, the latest iPad 4 delivers over 1,000 times faster graphics performance in just 10
years. This is part of the reason why the iPad 4 is faster than the vast majority of PC
laptops. And this foreshadows how well our architecture will scale into the mac.
Another place where we applied our focus was the Watch. We scaled our SoC
architecture to optimize performance for the devices' unique low power
requirements. And we built a chip perfectly suited for Apple Watch. All our SoC
enable each these products with unique features and end up the leading
performance per watt. And it makes each of them best in class. And we do this at an
enormous scale.
In fact, adding all of the processors across these three products, we shipped over 2
billion in just 10 years. And we've designed and shipped billions of additional chips,
that work together with ours SoCs to enable our amazing products. And now we'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 30 of 35Craig Federighibringing all of that expertise and that same focused and disciplined approach to the
mac.
The ﬁrst thing this will do is give them the mac a whole new level of performance.
Now when we talk about performance, we have to talk about power, because all
systems built today are constrained by power consumption, performance or both.
Among today's consumer systems, desktops deliver the highest performance but
consume the most power. Notebooks trade-oﬀ performance for lower power making
them portable. As you can see normally to get more performance, you have to
consume more power.
When you take a closer look at this chart, you realize you want to operate in the
upper left corner. You want to deliver the highest performance at the lowest power
consumption and that's exactly where we want to take the mac, building upon our
years of experience, designing the world's most energy eﬃcient chips, our plan is
give the mac a much higher level of performance, while at the same time consuming
less power. So much better performance is reason enough to transition to mac to
Apple SoCs. But that's just part of the story. Our scalable architecture includes many
custom technologies that when integrated with our software will bring even more
innovation to the mac.
With our advanced power management, we will maximize performance and battery
life better than ever before. Our Secure Enclave will bring best-in-class security and
our high performance GPU is going to bring a whole new level of graphics
performance to every mac, making them even better for pro applications and really
great for games. And combined with other neural [ph] engines, our chips will make
the mac an amazing platform for machine learning. And we're bringing many other
custom technologies such as our video display and image processing engines that
will help make the mac better than ever before.
So what does all of this meant for the mac. First, we're designing a family of SoCs
speciﬁcally for the mac product line. Second, just like we did with the iPhone, iPad
and Watch, we're going to bring great technologies to the mac. This will give the
mac a unique set of features and incredible performance. And third, we'll have a
common architecture across all of our product lines, making it far easier for
developers to run [ph] an optimized software for the entire Apple ecosystem.
Ultimately, we know that bringing our SoCs to the mac will allow us to build much
better products. And the mac will take another huge leap forward. Now a key
advantage we have is the tight integration of our silicon with our software.
To tell you more about how macOS will earn on Apple SoCs here is my colleague,
Craig.
{BIO 6190419 <GO>}
Thanks, Johny. Now let's talk about the technologies that we built into macOS Big
Sur that will make the transition to Apple silicon smooth and seamless for bothFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 31 of 35consumers and developers. These new mac systems will be incredible and users will
want their favorite apps to take full advantage of the capabilities of our custom
silicon and the best way to do that is with native apps.
So of course, when we updated our apps for Big Sur, we built everything as native
for Apple silicon. And I'm happy to say we have all of our own Apple apps including
our most demanding Pro Apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro up and running as
native now and they'll be ready for customers on day one. So how do we do this?
We're using Xcode just like all our developers will. Everything developers need to
build apps for these new chips is built into the new version of Xcode.
To get started developers just open their app projects and re-compile. The vast
majority of developers can get their apps up and running in just a matter of days.
And to deliver these apps, we've created Universal 2. It's a new type of universal
binary that works on both Intel-based macs and macs built on Apple silicon.
So developers can tap into the native power and performance of our new macs and
still support Intel-based macs, all with a single binary for all of their users. Some of
the biggest mac developers have already gotten started. Microsoft is hard at work on
oﬃce for the mac. And we've been working with Adobe on their ﬂagship Creative
Cloud and many of their apps are already up and running great. So let's take a look
at macOS running on Apple silicon. So here we are on the desktop that we know and
love. And I'm just going to open up about this mac. And what you see here is that we
are running on our Apple development platform. This is a system built to support
early development using the same A12Z processor currently shipping in iPad Pro.
Now I have a confession to make. This isn't the ﬁrst time you've seen macOS running
here. In fact, this is the same mac that Beth and I used to demo all the new Big Serve
features earlier. And as you saw earlier, we've updated all of our Apple apps and
they're running great. Of course, a big part of the mac experience is third party apps
and we've been working with our friends at Microsoft and they already have oﬃce
up and running natively on our new macs.
Let's take a look at word. It runs great. Scrolling is super smooth. Everything you do is
just super responsive. Next, let's checkout Excel. Just as you would expect complex
sheets and elements like this map all update instantly. And next, let's take a look at
PowerPoint. It's using metal [ph] for rendering and it performs great. For instance,
checkout how I can see all the layers of my slide in 3D. The animation is perfectly
ﬂuid and we've also been working closely with our friends at Adobe to bring
Creative Cloud to our new macs.
Here's Lightroom running native on Apple silicon, navigating large libraries of D&G
images is super-fast and all of Lightroom's editing controls are available right here.
Let's apply an adjustment to this image. Well, that's much better and we can apply
that same edit to all of these images in a single step. Looks great.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 32 of 35Next let me show you the App. I know many of you want to see, Photoshop. Here's a
5 gigabyte Photoshop ﬁled by photographer Steven Wilkes. Now this is a heavy duty
document with lots of layers. Now let's add one more bird in there. Not totally
comfortable with the level of social distancing but let's keep going. And let's check
out how smooth the animation is as I zoom out. Wow, beautiful. Finally, let's turn to
one of our most sophisticated apps, Final Cut Pro. Here it is running on Apple silicon
for the ﬁrst time.
Let's play back some 4K video. As you can see, playback is super smooth and all
your ﬁlters are here and you can apply them in real time. Let's try some color
correction. And I can even add animated titles and lens ﬂare all during live playback
and Final Cut takes advantage of the unique capabilities of the Apple neural engine
with a new feature that analyzes video and intelligently crop set to keep the most
important action the frame. But that's not all. Final Cut fully exploit the system's
multi-core architecture to let us play back, not just one or two but three streams of
full resolution 4K Pro all on a A12Z processor. Amazing. So that's a ﬁrst look at
Universal apps on Apple silicon.
We're really excited to see so much great work on native apps. These apps even get
more amazing when they're built to take advantage of the silicon's powerful
capabilities, like incredible CPU and graphics performance, a uniﬁed memory
architecture and the Neural Engine which accelerates advanced machine learning
tasks. The transition to Apple silicon is also great for developers who've already
optimize their apps for other Apple platforms. The shared architecture across our
products means that there code will absolutely sync on our new macs and there's
even more to the story.
We're doing some really important things to make this transition seamless for our
users. Now while we expect most developers will go native immediately, we want to
make sure that users can run all of their apps on day one, even if some apps haven't
yet updated. Now we've been down this road before. When we transition from
Power PC to Intel processors a cornerstone of that transition was Rosetta, a
technology that makes it possible to run PowerPC apps on Intel-based macs.
MacOS Big Sur will include a new version of Rosetta, Rosetta 2. Rosetta 2
automatically translate your existing Mac apps. So they work on new Macs with
Apple silicon. And this time Rosetta is even faster, more powerful and more
compatible. It translates the apps when you install them so they can launch
immediately instantly responsive and Rosetta 2 can also translate code on the ﬂy
when needed. Like for web browsers with just in time JavaScript compilers or for
Java code. It even handles the most complex Pro Apps, and their plugins.
Rosetta 2 is transparent to users and the performance is amazing. We're also
introducing new virtualization technologies in macOS Big Sur. So for developers who
want to run other environments like Linux or tools like DARCO [ph], we have you
covered. When you put all of these technologies together, Universal, Rosetta and
virtualization, you will have a system that can run an amazing diversity of apps.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22

Page 33 of 35Andreas Wendker
Craig FederighiTo show you how this all comes together, I'll hand it over to Andreas Wendker.
Thanks, Craig. Let's take a look at some existing apps running under Rosetta. Rosetta
of course works great with all sorts of apps that use her every day, but for our ﬁrst
demo I'd like to see something a bit more challenging. This is Maya, the powerful
animation and modeling software, running great here on Apple silicon. I already
have a model open that consists of over 6 million polygons and as you can see I can
ﬂuidly move around in the sea. So it's making it more challenging and bring textures
and still everything is incredibly ﬂuid.
So, Rosetta works great. And the performance is simply fantastic, but Rosetta isn't
just for apps. It also looks amazing very with games. I can even use a game
controller. This Shadow of the Tomb Raider, a high end AAA game that's using our
metal APIs. I download it directly from the mac App Store, so it's completely
unmodiﬁed and it is absolutely beautiful.
Let me jump into the water. You see some of the lighting eﬀects here and as I follow
the path, you can see the game is responsive and smooth. And the best part is
you're running at a 1080P as a translated app and emulation. So these new macs,
they are fast. You can see some more of the lighting eﬀects here. It's awesome, what
Rosetta can do is existing games.
Now, as Craig mentioned, many of our users rely on apps from other environments.
So if you bring up a Linux VM imperatives desktop you can see the graphical user
interface designed for Linux here, but of course many developers like to use Linux
for hosting service. So let me dive down to the command line and launch an Apache
Web server.
And now I can simply bring up Safari and browse the web site of the survey I just
launched in the Linux VM. Here it is. Now I want to show you one more type of app
to run on these new macs, we haven't even told you about yet. And that is iPhone
and iPad apps. Since they've been made to run on the same Apple silicon, that we
are using in our new macs they will run natively completely unmodiﬁed on the new
macs as well.
Let me show you a few. This here is one of my favorite games, Monument Value 2. It's
fun to play here on the new mac. And if I wanted to catch up on my guitar lessons, I
can do so splendidly. Well, if I want to relax at the end of the day, a little bit, I can
bring up the (inaudible). And that was just a quick look at Rosetta virtualization and
support for iPhone and iPad app, giving you just amazing versatility for running apps
and other environments this macOS on Apple Silicon. Back to you, Craig.

Thanks, Andreas. As you saw, macs built with Apple silicon will be able to run iPhone
and iPad apps directly. Starting day one, users can download these apps right fromFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22

With everything we're doing, the range of apps that users will be able to run on
these new macs is truly unprecedented.
Together, we have all the technologies in place to make this an amazing transition.
The vast majority of mac apps can be re-compiled as Universal in a few days. So
users can have fast native apps. Rosetta 2 runs existing mac apps, our virtualization
technology makes it easier than ever to bring other environments like Linux to the
mac. And mac users can for the ﬁrst time run iOS and iPad OS apps directly tapping
into the world's most vital app ecosystem.
Now we know our mac developers will be eager to get started on this new platform.
So to get them going right away, we're launching a QuickStart program. The focus of
the QuickStart program is to enable developers to make their apps universal and
take advantage of all the capabilities of Apple silicon. Developers will have access to
documentation and sample code, forums on developer.apple.com, priority support
incidents and access to labs around the world.
This program also includes new developer transition kit hardware, so developers can
get going even before we ship production systems. The DTK hardware takes the
form of a mac mini, but one with an A12Z SoC inside. It has desktop specs, including
16 gigabytes of memory, 512 gig SSD and a complement of mac I/O ports. Most
signiﬁcantly, it will include the macOS Big Sur developer beta and Xcode tools.
Developers will be able to apply to the program at developer.apple.com today. We
will be shipping units out starting this week. So you can get to work. So that's how
macOS Big Sur is paving the way for a smooth transition to Apple silicon. This year
we're elevating the mac to a whole new level and it's an incredible opportunity for
developers. I can't wait to see what you all create and I can't wait until we can all be
together in person again. And now back to Tim.

Thank you, Craig. And thank you, Johny. It truly is a historic day for the mac. Our
vision for the mac has always been about embracing breakthrough innovation and
having the courage to make bold changes. Every time, we've done this the mac has
come out stronger and more capable. And I have never been more conﬁdent about
the future of the mac than I am today.
So what's the timeline for this transition? Well, for developers it begins this week with
the valuable information delivered at this conference as well as applying for the
Quick Start program and for the customers, we expect to ship our ﬁrst mac with
Apple silicon, by the end of this year and we expect the transition to take about two
years.
We plan to continue to support and release new versions of macOS for Intel-based
macs for years to come. In fact, we have some new Intel-based macs in the pipeline
that we're really excited about. What a huge leap forward for the mac and for Apple.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-22

common architecture across all of our products.
What an incredible day of announcements. As you've seen, we haven't stopped
innovating. We pushed all of our platforms forward in some amazing new ways. Our
OS releases will be available as developer betas today and each of them will have a
public beta including watchOS for the very ﬁrst time starting next. And all of this
great software will be available to our customers this fall.
We hope you've enjoyed this very special keynote and that you are ready for the big
week ahead, with over 100 engineering-led video sessions, one-on-one
consultations with Apple engineers and so much more. We can't wait to start
working with all of you. And watch you do the best work of your lives.
At Apple, we've always drawn strength from the diversity of our global community,
because we truly believe when we all work together, we can change the world for
the better. Thanks to you all for joining us. This has been such a big day and it's only
the beginning of a huge week to come. So let's have a great WWDC.
