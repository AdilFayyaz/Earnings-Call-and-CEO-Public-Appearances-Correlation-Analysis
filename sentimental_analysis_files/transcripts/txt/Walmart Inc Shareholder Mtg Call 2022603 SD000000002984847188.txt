Hey everyone, it’s Antonio from Walmart World Social coming to you live from Bud
Walton Arena right here in Fayetteville, Arkansas.
So much fun, Antonio. I’m Amanda Jaeger here helping to bring the celebration to
you at home. I don’t know about you but it feels amazing having everybody here at
Associates Week in-person once again. And now it’s the big day, we’re counting
down to our Associates Celebration.
Yes, that’s right. We are so stoked to be here in the middle of the action. So no
matter where you’re at, if you’re in North West Arkansas or anywhere in the world
we’re going to bring the hype right here to you guys.
That’s right.
Yes. And you can see as – look the arena is packed, it’s full, the energy is coming
through our veins. Man this is going to be good. The associates brought it today.
Thousands of them and they’re coming in. It’s been crazy just in the last couple of
minutes. It’s like ﬁlled up.
Yes.
And this week really is all about your guys, the associates. And let me tell you, you

background, it is crazy. And guess what, even if you aren’t here with us, we saved you
a front row seat because that’s just what we do, Antonio.
That is what we do. And check it out, I have Bo down on the ﬂoor to introduce our
two new radio DJs for Walmart and Sam’s Club. DJ Bo, let’s go.
Hey, thanks, Antonio and Amanda. Yes we are right here on the ﬂoor in the middle of
all the action. The Hype Show happening. And we grew our family this week in the
Walmart and Sam’s Club radio world, we’ve got Chris and Kirby Gwen. What has
been your favorite part of shareholders week?
I mean, Bo, where do I start. Honestly the people, the passion the power, the pins. I
just feel like I have never met a more radiant and revolutionary group of individuals. I
mean, sorry, outside of my mom and dad. Hey, mom, hey, dad. How y’all doing? I
know they’re on the stream.
But honestly all of that makes me so proud to say I am oﬃcially a part of the Walmart
Sam’s Club family.
That’s right, y’all. And, Chris, what about you?
So the best part this week is I think I’ve been adopted by Canada so I think that’s the
coolest thing. Also I have learned that visiting Sheboygan, Wisconsin is really good
and they’ve got the freshest fried cheese curds. So it’s been incredible out here.
Nice. They're doing the cheer back behind us as you can hear them. It is the hype
show. We'll have more and just a bit back up to you, Amanda and Antonio.
All right, thank you guys. I have got to personally meet the new DJs today, and they
have some incredible people. You were a DJ once.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

year anniversary energy. I know I'm feeling it.
We've got some associate shout outs. We've got so many people online watching
right now wanting to just give a little credit to the people they love.
Yes. So I'm going to give a shout out to Peter at 444 out there in Jacksonville, Florida.

One of my favorite things about the Walmart culture is that we have a very special
cheer. And in that cheer, we have the squiggly. I know how we do the squiggly in the
US, but you got to show me how y'all break that squiggly down. Show me the
international squiggly ready? 123 squiggly. They get down.
I like that. I'm going to say here practicing. I'm going to stay here partying with my
people. Back to you, Antonio and Amanda.
Oh, man, Kirby, the energy with those associates, you can't make this up people. And
you know what? It's just so crazy we want to bring that experience to you. For those
who are watching.
I want them to do the squiggly from home.
Let's get it.
You can do it from your seat. It don't matter.
Come on, come on.
I'm feeling the energy, And I want to keep the dancing up, because it's sometimes
hard to feel the energy at home. But Antonio, you're always here with a few moves
and I think that'll bring the energy to wherever the people are. Can we do a little
dance? What have we got?

anniversary.
Can you believe that?
Like what is going on here?
Like it means so much too, just because it was a couple years where everybody was
home. It couldn't make it here and then to have so many people back. I mean, in the
last 15, 20 minutes this place is just ﬁll up people left and right, again, people from
countries all over the world because Walmart is all over the world.
It is. Now I know this is your ﬁrst experience with this associates week. How are you
taking it in so far?
It's a lot to take in in the best possible way. I mean, you can hear the cheering in the
background and people are just excited to be here. You can tell that this is an
experience of a lifetime and I'm feeling that too. I mean, it feels surreal in some ways,
because it's just so big and it's just a blast. I'm having a great time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Thank you so much, Chris. Love having those conversations with the DJs down here
now. Now, Antonio, it's not just Chris and Kirby and Beau that have been doing some
fun stuﬀ with associates. I've heard rumors that you have been doing some pretty fun

the stores, the clubs, DC fulﬁllment centers and encourage these associates to have
fun, capturing great stories and bring it back home and showing right there on a
Walmart world social channels.
Oh my gosh, it sounds so fun. Have you got to do any fun things yet? Maybe some
things involving bees and honey?
A little bit of stuﬀ like that. It was -- it was crazy because one of my biggest fears was
bees, but once I got to be around them, it was so sweet.
That was one of your biggest fear?
One of my biggest fears. Oh, it's going to keep -- it it's going to get bigger and
bigger.
You’re facing fears, you're meeting associates. I mean, what aren't you doing,
Antonio? I'm so excited to see this, it is going to be epic. Okay, speaking of
associates, we want to keep highlighting our associates. For 60 years, it has been our
associates making this impact not only inside the stores, but also throughout their
communities as well.
Yes. And one of those particular associate happens to be Patrice who has taken her
life experience in 13 years of growing with the company to oﬀer new opportunities
right there in our local town and city. Check it out.
I started as an overnight associate in Evergreen Park. I had no expectations about
career path, or that that role would take me to where I am today. Once I got here and
I became accustomed to the culture, I felt like I could be more, right? I could be
more than what I thought I could be. We lived through a lot of struggles as most
people growing up in Chicago do.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Antonio Williams
Amanda JaegerThere were times when there wasn't food to eat, I didn't really have a lot of people
pushing me saying, “Patrice, you really need to go to school, or you can do this or
you can be really good at this. You could be a teacher, you could be a lawyer.” I want
people to see that there's opportunity here.
The Academy's mission is simply to strengthen opportunity through learning. We
wanted to provide a place where people could learn where they live. These classes
are absolutely free. Two thirds of this location is dedicated to community training. We
have resume writing, interview skills, standardized test prep, we'll have some tech
oﬀerings, and we’re doing HVAC certiﬁcation.
I'm hoping what people will get out of the Academy is a pathway, right, a career
pathway. Most of the people I talked to believe that this is a training center for
Walmart associates. And I tell them it is, right? But it's also a training center for you.
And they're like, “What do you mean?” I'm like, “It's for you. It's for the community.”
I say you're more than welcome to come in here and take advantage of these
classes. We want you to come in here and take advantage of these classes. I believe
this Academy and this community has a bright future.
Oh, my gosh. Isn't she so amazing?
She is incredible.
Oh, my gosh. Who doesn't love great stories like that? You know what? We're
posting stories like that on the daily on the regular right over there at

Oh man, it is so easy to follow us. And speaking of social, Antonio, I know you guys
have seen all those viral TikTok videos of those delivery drones. I'm so jealous.
They've been making their way around the country. I mean, literally from drone to
doorstep. It's incredible. But I don't know maybe have you ever wondered what it
would be like to work with a drone?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 11 of 71Antonio Williams
Amanda Jaeger
Unidentiﬁed SpeakerI contemplated at one point.
I have too. Well, we caught up with -- Walmart World caught up with Derek. He's a
drone that's desperate to ﬁt in as a Walmart associate. Take a look.
So we have this new guy, Derek, started just a couple of weeks ago and honestly, it's
super fascinating working with him. You're doing great. Sometimes he hovers which
can be a little bit weird, but I mean, hey, he's learning a new team. And overall, I'm
really looking forward to working with him.
You’re liking your sandwich, Derek? So pretty big sandwich there, man.
I don't know about Derrick. I mean, every time I tried to have a conversation with
him, he just sits there and he says nothing. Okay, have you seen this Walmart roll
TikTok, though? I mean, it's so funny.
I don't know about Derrick. I mean, every time I try to have a conversation with him,
he just sits there. And he says nothing. Okay, have you seen this Walmart roll tick
tock, though? I mean, it's so funny.
I guess it's better than him like droning on and on about something that I don't even
care about. At ﬁrst, I thought that maybe it's just because he's working in a diﬀerent
part of the store, but I don't know. I think he doesn't have like that with all of us.
Man, I don't know. There's just so much happening in my life all at once. We're
planning this wedding and it's like did we really need the extra cotton candy
machine? I don't know. He's a marvelous listener. And he's made me better at my
job, stocking, zoning and putting up every kind of ﬁshing lure. And to be honest with
you, Derek, it's just -- it's just a lot, man. It's just a lot.
He just listens quietly. And it's amazing to work with him. And I think Karen is starting
to see that too.
I'm coming around to working with Derek. What are you doing, Derek? All this is
going to be going to you later so you better not drop it. Man, I'll see you later. It was
good catching up. And no, he does not say much but I don't know. I thought it was a
little standoﬃsh at ﬁrst, but now it's kind of like a mystery to be solved.
Derek, are you going to introduce me to your friends? Come on. I know he's going
to be in another part of the store working with other associates. But I kind of like toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Page 12 of 71Antonio Williamsthink that whenever he's with them, maybe he's thinking about me.
Do you know where the bicycle water bottle cages are?
We absolutely do. I'll take you to those right away. Remember, Derek, the customer
is always number one. Always. Cool. Let's go man.
Is that a -- is that a drone?
Yes, that is a drone, Derek, actually.
Bye Karen.
Did you hear that?
You too, bud.
Didn't hear it. I felt it. Bye, Derek, we’ll miss you.
Please come back soon, ﬂy to us.
The store is not the same without you, buddy.
You can drone on anytime. It's ﬁne.
When you left you took a piece of me with you.
We’ll never be the same. You changed us, Derek.
Derek, without your propellers I'm nothing.
I feel sky high because of you.
Derek, my heart soars in your presence.
You are everything to me, Derek.
Derek, can I borrow your wings buddy?
Oh, man, I think it'd be hard to work with Derek. He got the higher advantage
around more people. You see what I did there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Okay. So today is special for so many reasons. Okay. I have to say this is our ﬁrst time
to gather in this arena since 2019 and I know for many of you this is a very ﬁrst time
you've been at shareholders. And Team Canada, you're crazy. I’m glad to be part of
you.
But it's pretty special that we can all physically now be together. And it's a super
special time of year. So today we're here with associates from around the world,
representing Walmart US. What about Walmart International? Walmart International.
Global tech -- global tech, governance, ﬁnance, corporate aﬀairs, people and Sam’s
Club.
We’re also celebrating a very special Walmart milestone. This year is our company's
60th anniversary. Okay, Sam’s Club, you’re not 60. So, I’m going to ask everyone to
kindly rise for the national anthem. It will be performed by Jeremy Butler, an
entertainment associate from store number 69 in Festus Missouri.
That was truly beautiful and amazing. Thank you so much, Jeremy. We had the
chance to be earlier this week which is wonderful. Associates, please join me now in
welcoming Dr. John Wig, Our Chief Medical Oﬃcer.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

And, Dr. Wig, as we both know it's been a challenging two years but I think this
group is ready to celebrate today.
{BIO 22431351 <GO>}
Absolutely.
{BIO 16617461 <GO>}
And we also know that our associates across the globe make the diﬀerence here at
Walmart. And throughout the pandemic, they accomplished some pretty incredible
things to serve customers, members and support our communities and each other.
{BIO 22431351 <GO>}
Absolutely. That's right, Donna. Love being here, guys. Sam's Club amazing. I had to
say. Each of you guys had been truly heroic, and we've been through some really
tough times. We appreciate you, we thank you. And when you think about some of
the amazing things that we've collectively accomplished, a couple of things.
Obviously in the pandemic 800 active COVID testing sites tested hundreds of
thousands of people, we've administered 10s of millions of vaccines to protect
against COVID-19, right? The important thing is we're doing that while someone is
actually shopping for their groceries so we're making their lives better and we're
saving lives. No other company can do that.
Lastly, and I love this one is we've been able to hire more than 500,000 new
associates since the beginning of 2020. I'm one of them, started nine months ago.
So this is an amazing company you guys are amazing. Truly blessed to be here.
{BIO 16617461 <GO>}
Our associates absolutely do you make the diﬀerence.
{BIO 22431351 <GO>}
Absolutely. So today associate celebration is all about you not just Sam's Club,

{BIO 19197529 <GO>}
Hey Walmart. How are you? Welcome to the 2022 Walmart associates meeting.
We’re doing it. My God, it's too early for you all to be this excited. I'm your host
today, James Corden. Or if you're in the very back and you squint, you can pretend
I'm basically a post-pandemic Matt Damon.
You might know me as the host of The Late Late Show on CBS or is that carpool
karaoke guy. Some of you will know me as the guy in your grocery section who eats
a whole bag of grapes, leaves without paying, and doesn't buy anything else, and for
that, I apologize.
It's an honor to be here the beautiful Bud Walton Arena, home of the Arkansas
Razorbacks and look at you. Look at all of these associates here this morning, my
God. Now I got to be honest, I might need you to bear with me for just a second. It's
a little loud. I love you to sir, but I too, I'm nursing quite the hangover this morning.
I'm not on a current level with you Walmart. I haven't been to bed.
Okay. I've been out. I've been on an all-nighter. I've been out. I've been out with
Doug McMillon and Greg Penner. They took me out, they hit it hard man. We started
at Jay Jay's. We went to Maxine's, we were -- we were like a three man wolf pack. It
was unbelievable. I was so drunk he got to 3am I said, “God, I got to go, I got to go, I
got to go.” Doug said, “Don't be stupid. We're hitting the club man. We're going to --
we’re going to pop bottles at the club.” I said, “What are you talking about? What
club?” He said, “We going to -- we go to Sam's Club.”
Okay, I'm telling you now it was -- it was brutal. Okay. Did you not hear what I just
said? I've got a terrible headache. It's actually very selﬁsh. Now we went for it, man.
We did Member's Mark vodka, we were on a Member's Mark Gin, Members Mark
whisky. Me and Doug -- me and Doug were doing member's Mark jello shots oﬀ
Greg’s shaved chest.
I mean, I couldn't believe it. I said to Greg I said Greg, “Are you sure we're allowed to
do this? You got a big day tomorrow?” He looks at me he went, “Bro I'm married to
Rob Walton’s daughter. I think we're good, man.”
Come on, that's not why you got the job. Now look. I got to be honest look, I host a
national television show that airs at 12:37 in the morning on CBS. Technically this isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Page 23 of 71the biggest audience I've ever played to. So let’s -- we're going to get to know each
other. Before we go any further we're going to go around the room one by one and
introduce ourselves. Okay? Let's start with you sir. Stand up. Tell us your name, where
you’re from.
Mitch, from South Africa. Look at you Mitch. It's so great to be here with you. I can't
tell you how wonderful is to see all of you. When Walmart asked me to do this event,
of course, I said yes. I mean, I've been meaning to -- I had to pick up a few things
anyway. So with LA's traﬃc, it's actually just quicker to ﬂy to Arkansas. This is actually
the second time I've hosted this event, which is why I'm wearing this jacket
Doug actually tattooed this on my back as well. But look, I like this, it makes my eyes
pop. And let's be honest, I'll be looking for a job this time next year. So willing to talk
to any employers here. I've left some resumes in the lobby. But I love Walmart. I do. I
love your energy, every single one of you and we also there's congratulations in
order. Walmart is 60 years old this year. 60 years. Tough.
It’s though, though. Like what do you -- what kind of birthday gift to you give
someone that literally sells everything? It's tough. But Walmart you just keep
growing, you keep becoming more successful. Today there are more than 10,000
stores and clubs in 24 countries and some of those countries are represented right
here in this room today.
We got associates from Chile in the house, Canada are in the house, Mexico and
Central America are in the house, India are here today, Africa are here today. Bless
you for making the trip. We got to be quick. Doug's got to Zoom at 9am, so we really
got to --
Okay. Were you all at Sam's club last night as well, and I just don't remember? But
look Walmart is focused on the future. That's where we are. There are so many
exciting initiatives that will make you all so proud, exciting initiatives, brand new
initiatives, like the new and 90% employee discounts.
Sorry, that was something we were talking about in Maxine’s last night. That was -- I
don't think it actually got signed oﬀ. I'm sorry. But one big initiative is Walmart's
digital transformation with expanded delivery and pickup options. I'm not sure I like
the phrase digital transformation. It sounds like sort of when you give up working out
in a gym, and you just decide to Photoshop six pack abs onto all your photos.
Other big Walmart initiatives or ethics and integrity. Another major initiative moving
forward and this is incredible what Walmart are doing sustainability. In fact, 40% of
Walmart's energy comes from renewable resources. And they are making their work
-- and they’re making that 100% by 2035. Now, you might be asking yourself, how?
How will they do this? This will become clearer, a little later in the show, when
everyone just gets one of those little wind turbine hats. That's something that we're
working on.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 24 of 71Greg PennerThe ﬁnal initiative I wanted to tell you about is associate opportunity. This includes
advanced training, a free college degree program, and increased wages and
beneﬁts. I mean, a free college degree program that's huge. That's massive. I mean, I
feel silly, I had to pay for my Harvard MBA out of my own pocket. I mean, damn my
passion for macroeconomics.
But yes, with all of these initiatives, rest assured, as a Walmart associate, the future is
bright. And look, we're going to get this meeting started. So sit back, relax, enjoy the
presentation. We have huge performances for you that you're not going to believe
coming up. And look, this is the ﬁrst time everybody is gathered here since 2019.
And it's been -- it has been the toughest and hardest few years.
But I got to tell you, every single one of you in this room, and I mean this from the
bottom of my heart, every Walmart associates stepped up and made a real
diﬀerence to every single one of their communities around the world. They really,
really did and we're back and you should celebrate the fact that we're back.
Celebrate what you've done, what you've been through.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time please welcome to the stage your Chairman, a man
who hasn't been to bed. He has a fresh tattoo of mine and Doug McMillon's face on
his ass right now. I love him. You love him, not as much as he loves his father-in-law,
it's Greg Penner, everybody.
{BIO 5585986 <GO>}
I love James Corden. We'll see Doug's tattoo later. Good morning. It's my honor as
your Chairman to welcome you to the 52nd annual Walmart associate and
shareholders meeting.
And this is a really special year, not only because it's the ﬁrst time we're back in Bud
Walton since 2019, but also because, as James said, we've hit a major milestone as a
company. It's been 60 years since Sam opened the ﬁrst Walmart store just up the
road from us in Rogers, Arkansas.
And he started with the same initial strategy to provide customers with low prices
every day. While we celebrate that today, there are three things I want to make sure
you take away from this meeting. First, I am really proud of what you and all of our
associates have accomplished these last two years.
Back at the start of the pandemic, I visited DC 7018 and store 1585 in North Platte,
Nebraska. And I was beyond impressed to see how our teams continued to serve
customers and support each other. You all have kept us moving forward in the face
of incredible obstacles, and I can't thank you enough for all your hard work.
The second thing I want to recognize and appreciate Doug McMillon and his
leadership team. I truly believe we have the best group of leaders in the world. I saw
how tirelessly you all worked through the pandemic, not only to keep our core retailFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 25 of 71Barbara Huntbusiness operating, but at the same time actually accelerating the transformation of
our business and serving customers in new ways.
We've made solid progress across the business; Walmart Plus in the US, curbside
pickup at Sam's Club, and we've expanded access to aﬀordable goods and services
in all of our international markets. It's amazing to me what you all have
accomplished.
The third thing, because of our associates are leaders in the changes you've made
our company is really well positioned for the next 60 years. Remember that change,
trying new things, is a big part of our culture. I know it's not always easy trust me.
Back in 1994 I joined the team at store number four in Siloam springs Arkansas.
This old hick keeps following me around, but that was my ﬁrst day there. I was a
young assistant store manager and after seeing the volume ﬂow through that store, I
remember thinking to myself, “There is no possible way for us to do more.” But
guess what? That same store is now across town from its original location in a facility
that's 100,000 square feet larger and doing about 100 million more in sales per year.
You can absolutely do more than you think is possible.
Now I'd like to take a moment to introduce your board of directors. I'd like to ask all
of our board members in attendance to stand and please hold your applause until
the end. With us today our Senior Client Advisor from Morgan Stanley Carla Harris,
former American Airlines Chairman and CEO, Tom Horton, Walmart President and
CEO, Doug McMillon, former AT&T Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson,
Founder and Chair of RZC Investments, Steuart Walton, and of course, my
predecessor as Chairman, Rob Walton.
Thank you all for the perspective you bring to Walmart and the willingness -- your
willingness to continue to serve. In 2019, at this meeting, I said to you, our success
will be determined by the risks we take, the changes we make, and how we manage
this transformation. Based on our solid results and signiﬁcant revenue growth over
the past couple of years, I'd say we're doing pretty well.
We have a lot of talented people who make up Walmart and who have contributed
over the past 60 years to our success. So the question I often ask myself, and the
question I'd like to leave you with is this, what will the next 60 years look like? It's
exciting that we all get to be a part of creating that story. Now, we've got a great
morning ahead. So let's get on with the meeting. Thank you.

{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
Thank you, Marla. Thank you. Okay guys. Wasn’t Marla fantastic? Did you hear what
our members said in that video? And that’s not a hype reel. Those are actual
members’ comments. And that kind of feedback, that gets me hyped up, and it’s a
great way to get things started. So hello, Walmart.
Okay. So now I was warned not to say the S word too often. So we’re going to do it
once, loud but brief, hello, Sam’s Club. Okay, thank you. Okay. So, let’s get -- yes, let’s
get a little serious. I want to -- I want to introduce you to something? What is this
thing?
Well, this is our ﬂywheel. And it is our strategy in one colorful graphic, which is really
kind of cool. But it all starts at the top with being member obsessed. If we get that
right, the rest falls into place and we create this momentum that’s unstoppable and
fuels our growth and we are growing.
We’re coming oﬀ two of the most successful years in the history of our company, but
that was then and this is now. And while we deﬁnitely have momentum, we need to
keep this thing spinning. And how do we do that? Well, you do that, our associates
do that. You bring this ﬂywheel to life every day, whether it’s an ordinary day or an
extraordinary day.
And in a company our size, we have a lot of extraordinary days. On those days we
always rise to the occasion. But what I am just as proud of is how we handle those
other days, those days that don’t make the headlines but they make our members’
lives better.
So, no matter what your role with us, you play a part in getting this wheel turning. So
I think it’s important to understand how it all connects. So let’s see. Design and
curate quality items and services that members love. At our core, we are an item
business. We oﬀer quality items at disruptive prices.
To make certain we oﬀer items our members can't resist, we steal ideas from them
shamelessly and they love it. We're mining member feedback on social media and in
our clubs. We've even formed this group of 40,000 members that we call My
Members Mark community. They inﬂuence designs and ﬂavors for our private brandsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Melanie Loftuslike one of my favorites the brisket staﬀ to bacon wrapped hula poppers. Yes, they're
in big favorite in the McLay household, and there's plenty of other great items.
Anyway, after our members weigh in, and our merchants make it a reality, our
conversations ﬁnd clever ways to drive sales, like Timothy hope and Dallas Callaway
of club 4770 in Evans, Colorado. Their TikTok video was one of our highest
performing social posts. When it went up the Club sold out of that item within days,
and the video spikes national interest. Take a look.
(video playing)
Tim and Dallas are absolutely member-obsessed and I love that kind of creativity. So
next one, provide easy access. This is one of our competitive advantages. We want to
solve our members’ problems before they even know they have them. So let me
introduce you to mark Stayer, Johann Rundberg and Ben Ford. These associates
pitched the concept of scanner chip at our tech innovation jam. They were out to
solve a problem. What happens when you buy this, but you drive this? It turns out,
you just need this.
Scan and ship lets members buy big bulky items in the Club and have them shipped
directly to their homes. Thanks to Mark, Johann and Ben, we launched this last year.
And they are here with us today. Gentlemen, can you stand up? So guys, keep the
innovations coming and a great big thank you for me.
The next one, invest in associates. This one is a no-brainer. We have to invest in our
associates, whether it's through wage increases or career training and development.
And we're not surprised when that investment pays oﬀ, not just for the Club, but for
the communities we also serve. Like in this small Ohio town where Melanie Loftus,
our pharmacist of the year in 2021 started the Hope Clinic, a free pharmacy for the
underserved.
(Start of Video Presentation)
My name is Melanie Loftus, I'm a pharmacy manager here at Sam's Club in
Chillicothe, Ohio. I intended to eventually open a charitable pharmacy. I thought it
would be 50 years down the road when I was retired. But I just felt like the company
was really preparing me.
She's an amazing person. I've really not met hardly anybody like her does it just
gives her time and gives her whole heart into something that they're so passionate
about.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

We're honored that Melanie is here with us today. Melanie, do you want to stand up?
Thank you, Melanie. Not only do your members love you, but your community clearly
loves you too. I love the way you invested in yourself through Live Better You and
then you reinvested what you learned back into the community. Thank you.
So with three turns of the wheel, you've met some associates who have done some
pretty extraordinary things. Now, not all of us can open a nonproﬁt or invent a new
technology. But all of us can make an impact on the everyday lives of our members.
You heard the stories in that video when I walked in; the member who trusts
Members Mark for her baby's wipes and diapers, the members who swear by the
convenience of scan and go and curbside, and my favorite, the member who said
life is kind of sponsored by Sam's Club.
These are the stories of lives made easier and better of added value. They're made
possible by the work of extraordinary associates getting it done every single
ordinary day. And that is how we really spin the ﬂywheel. I am so proud to be part of
this team. Thank you

techniques to do what I do; mind reading, minds inﬂuencing and bullshit.
And let me explain to you, we are all here after the pandemic. I'm going to count to
three. Listen to me, I’m going to count to three. On three, each one of you on the
back of the sides in the middle, you're going to turn around and shake the hand of

And you found it impossible, right? You're like this. Wait, wait, how do I do it? It's like
this. I don’t know. And then the last -- the last row went like, “There's a wall.” Right?
So it's based on the concept that I know how you think. And if I know how you think,
you can manipulate your mind. So I'm going to ask you a question. I want you all to
get your energy, everyone. Oh, this is interesting.
I want to try to do something over here. My mother, she taught me to be a

Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 36 of 71Christina [ph] and Tim Hole [ph] of the Walmart China team, thank you for everything
that you are doing through extraordinary times. We miss you and we'll see you next
year.
But you know, this week is a celebration of all of you. So I actually want to start with
the most important thing which is to say thank you. Thank you for everything that you
have done and that you continue to do wherever in the world that you work.
You know, I've been with Walmart for 26 years and I can tell you that this is my
absolute -- thank you, I started young. And this is my absolute favorite meeting of the
year. And I've missed it. And I can tell you this morning, as we started I got quite
emotional and my team will tell you not for the ﬁrst time this week but it's because so
much has happened since we were last together.
We've changed a huge amount as a company, in ways large and small but for me the
things that haven't changed are just as important as those that have. And there are
three things that are true in every corner of the Walmart world wherever you are.
The ﬁrst is our purpose. As Sam Walton said, “If we work together we'll give the
world an opportunity to see what it's like to save and have a better life.” That is a
pretty cool purpose.
And the second, well that's really simple. It's in the chair [ph]. Who's number one?
Oh, yes. It's universal in every market, every platform, every store, every app, every
moment of every day, we put the customer at the center of what we do.
And the third thing is you, our people make the diﬀerence. For me this is the true
heart and soul of this company. It really is our superpower.
These three things plus our values give us an incredibly strong foundation as a
business. But there is something also that's very much at our heart and has been for
60 years. Which is that we oﬀer access and inclusion for customers, for communities,
and for associates in ways that very few other companies can do.
Now access for our customers means that wherever you live or whoever you are,
we're right here for you.
Now Mexico is doing some amazing work in this area and I wanted to ask. Thank you
Mexico.
And I ask Gui Loureiro, who is our President and CEO of Walmart Mexico in Central
America to tell us about a new service that they've launched.
Gui, are you out there?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Judith McKenna{BIO 18736707 <GO>}
Hi Judith. Good morning everyone.
Good day Walmart Mexico, Central America. Good day. Wow. How much time would
we have, Judith?
Judith, in Mexico, 40% of the households don't have access to the internet. This is a
huge barrier for our customers. It stops them connect with each other, from getting
information, and from having access to the beneﬁts of the digital economy. We saw a
huge customer need that only we could help solve. In 2020, we launched our
prepaid connectivity and cell phone services available in all our business formats
national wide.
We call it BAIT, Bodega Aurrera Internet and Telephone. It's a service for customers
to place calls and access the internet from their cell phones. And it costs at least
three times less than the competition. Anybody can sign up by walking to one of our
2,800 stores and clubs and top up their data there or online. The response has been
incredible.
And today we have 3.7 million customers using BAIT. This is -- this is life changing for
so many people in Mexico. And we are really proud of being there for them. Thank
you.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Gui, thank you. I love what the team are doing. They're providing access and
inclusion. They're helping people save money. And helping people live better. So
Gui and team, thank you for everything that you're doing.
You know, that inclusiveness also matters for our communities. And there's a really
inspiring example of this in Chile.
Last year the team formed a one-of-a-kind alliance with a social enterprise called
ONE KAYO [ph]. Their goal is to promote creative talent in a community called Bajos
de Mena. It's a densely populated community in Santiago, the capital of Chile. And
one of the challenges the community has, it has high poverty rates and high crime
rates. But there are also extraordinary, extraordinary people there. The team worked
with one ONE KAYO [ph] artist who live there to develop an exclusive line of
products to sell in our stores. There's pictures, T-shirts, bags, and lots more. And I can
tell you these sell out as soon as they hit the shelves. The designs reﬂect the
vibrancy, courage and culture, of the people who created them. And they just
needed an opportunity to put their talent on display and be able to sell it.
And I love what the local mayor said about our campaign. We sincerely hope that
Chile and the world recognize the beauty of these products that are born from
talented, digniﬁed, and hard-working hands.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

home in Bentonville.
So thank you to Chile. Excellent.
And ﬁnally, and perhaps my absolute favorite of these, is the access and inclusion
that we oﬀer to our associates who work at Walmart.
We're not exclusive. We're inclusive. And each of us has a story. Whatever your
background, wherever you come from, whatever your education, whoever you are,
we're open to everybody.
And this week I have met so many of you who are amazing. And whatever your story,
we want to give you opportunities to learn and to grow. We want to create an
environment where everybody can be themselves.
I was in India recently with our Flipkart team, and I saw a video that they created.
We have four associates from Flipkart and they're over there. There are 1.3 billion
people in India, from many diverse cultures and backgrounds. Everybody has a story.
And as in so many places around the world, access to opportunity at work hasn't
always been equal. Flipkart is working to change that. Take a look at this?
(video playing)
Inclusion is part of who we are. And while we celebrate all the things that make us
diﬀerent, we also celebrate the things that make us the same. You are part of a team,
a 2.3 million-people strong, in 24 countries around the world.
And you really do make a diﬀerence, for our customers, our communities, and each
other. Thank you Walmart, for everything you do.

Judith like myself from the U.K. She's lived here ten years. I've lived here eight. But
you got to bear with me and Judith. At the moment we're pretty jittery. It's the
Queen's Diamond Jubilee this weekend. And that is -- that's pretty much how Super

But look that's not the only big event that's going on in the world right now. I got to
tell you ladies and gentlemen, I actually have some I have some sad news. It's a sad
day. My dear friend. My old friend. My best friend. Walmart Executive Vice President

essential part of the Walmart team and every single one of us is going to miss him.
You can feel it already in the room.
I regret bringing it up now because it's really sucked the air out of everything. We
were really good -- you remember that when I hosted this event in 2016, I held Brett
on stage. I held him. It left a mark on me. I know it left a mark on him.
It's -- it’s impossible to forget. Time stood still for both of us and I'm going to level
with you, the only reason I've come here today, I couldn't give a shit about any of
you. Doug [ph] said, Will you come and -- will you come and host the event?” I said,
“No chance.” He said, “Why?” I said, “Because you start it at 7:00 AM.” He said, “It's
going to be Bret's last one.” I said, “I'll walk on glass to be there.”
Because Brett, I got to tell you -- he's stepping down. After 70 years on the throne

Good morning, Walmart. Okay. Let me be really speciﬁc.
Good morning Walmart U.S. Let me get the sound check.
How it worked. Okay.
Look I'm so proud of the team in the U.S., our business has grown 13% in the past
two years including 90% e-commerce growth.
And we've achieved so much more. So like I want to say thank you to everyone
who's been a part of the team, and not just this past two and a half years but for the
past 60 years. Wow.
The history has always fascinated me. It's inﬂuenced all of us. For example, the 1950s.
(music playing)
There is population growth, the start of the interstate system, and changes to pricing
laws. And those factors led to many new retailers, beginning in 1962.
And now if you think about customers in the 1960s.
(music playing)
Customers were looking for bargains they were looking for deals and car culture was
exploding. People were buying more in a single shopping trip.
But the pace of change, it picked up in the 1970s.
(music playing)
So suburbs are growing and shopping was growing with them.
Now. Okay. You want to talk about this then.
How about my favorite decade the 1980s?
(music playing)
Oh, that was amazing, right.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 42 of 71Now the 1980s also gave us some amazing fashion trends.
Check this out.
(video playing)
Okay. Maybe let's just move on from that for a second.
Let's talk about the 1990s.
(music playing)
Got it.
(music playing)
Customers were thinking big. Large formats. Large selections. And then when the
2000 came.
(music playing)
Ecommerce and ship to home took oﬀ and it started with items like books and then
expanded to so much more.
And then in the most recent decade, the 2010s.
(music playing)
Online shopping, when mobile customers wanted it all together, digital, and
physical.
And the reason we are here today is that as customers kept changing Walmart chose
to innovate and execute those innovations really well. Adding auto and pharmacy in
the 1970s, Grocery in the ‘80s, rolling out supercenters and neighborhood markets in
the ‘90s, starting Walmart.com in the 2000s, and then building a nationwide pickup
and delivery business out of our stores in the 2010s and opening health centers.
And sometimes we stopped doing things. We learned. We moved on. But we were
never afraid to innovate.
Now do you know, when that really made a diﬀerence? 2020.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 43 of 71Suresh KumarAs the pandemic hit, was a moment we never expected but a moment our business
and our people now being called essential workers were ready for.
Now because of all the innovation, pharmacy, grocery, curbside pickup, delivery, and
so much more, we were able to play a major role in keeping an entire country fed,
healthy, and safe.
And we've always said, “Our people make the diﬀerence.” And our people all of you,
you really made the diﬀerence.
So let me show you a story about just one associate.
(video playing)
Well that pharmacy associates on the video is here with us.
Justin? Come on up here [ph], Justin?
As Max's parents said, you represented hope at a time of hopelessness. Thank you.
Now also Max and his dad were able to join us today, to show you their appreciation.
They’re right appear here [ph]. And that is what our Walmart U.S. business looks like
today.
Now we're so grateful to the leaders who came before us, preparing us for this
decade, the 2020s. And now it's our job to continue that legacy for the future and
get ready for the next decades.
We'll work fast. We'll work digitally. And we'll further reshape our business with
health and wellness, ﬁnancial services, and our Walmart Plus Membership Program.
And it's all it's all in service to the customer, getting them what they want, whenever,
and however they want it. And most importantly we'll continue to innovate and
execute those innovations well, and we’ll serve customers for many more decades to
come. Thank you.

Meeting. It's -- it's just so special to give real recognition to somebody who's been
way above or to a group that's been way above and beyond the expectations.
That entrepreneurial spirit is what Dad stood for. And it's been our way to keep his
spirit alive and present in the company.

It's a recognition of what Walmart is about all about. Its experimentation. It's -- its
willingness to change. And it's that constant focus on the customer.

Doug McMillonHow you doing, buddy? Nice job.
Good morning, Walmart. Hey, let's talk about these guys for a second. I agree with
what Greg said, we have the best drives in the world full stop. I know these two have
known Rickey for longer, and I can promise you they lead with a servant’s heart with
the work that they do, and they’ve been doing it for a long time, and I'm so pleased
that we could [ph] tell their story.
As you know, our drivers are the best ambassadors for our company anywhere, and
we got some other drivers here with us this morning, I think they're right back here, if
we make sure they're all recognized too. We certainly recognize and appreciate all of
these folks. Thank you, guys -- appreciate it. Thank you, see you soon.
First of all, Greg and I were not out with James Cordon last night, that did not
happen. And secondly, we need to hire Lior Suchard to help us ﬁgure out how much
inventory to buy next year, don’t we? It's been a few years of too little and too much,
but he already knows how much we need, so it'd be worth it. We'll pay for it.
I love movies --
I love you, Doug.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I love you too. I love big movies, like Star Wars and Top Gun and everything with
James Bond or Indiana Jones. I love the humor of movies like Forrest Gump, Shrek
or a League of Their Own. My favorites have heroes and villains where the heroes
win with style and maybe even a little sarcastic humor.
If the story of Walmart -- were a movie, it'd be a sweeping epic that starts with a few
lead characters, Sam, Helen and Bud. The original setting is a classic brick building in
the small downtown of Newport, Arkansas in 1945. It says Ben Franklin Stores 5 and
Dime [ph] above the awning. Imagine a glass storefront with Ivan Flack [ph]
lampshades and paint, with an ice cream machine up front that Bud did not enjoy
cleaning.
From the beginning, this movie has drama. Sam’s success motivated the landlord not
to renew the lease, so his son could have the store.
(video playing)
So, the Waltons pack up, they moved to Bentonville, population 2,942. It's there that
he opens another Ben Franklin, this time carrying the Walton name. It’s successful,
and he parlays that into 17 more. But Sam has new and diﬀerent ideas about how toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 61 of 71serve customers and the franchise owners didn’t want to change, so in 1962, he
opens the ﬁrst Walmart Discount Store.
There are even more people skeptical about that idea. Apparently, some thought he
was clueless --
(video playing)
Most people didn’t think a broad assortment with low prices in small towns would
work. There just wouldn't be enough business. So, Sam was swimming upstream
from the beginning. But it turns out, he was right. Walmart Discount Stores thrived.
Demand from customers was strong, we were going to need something bigger.
(video playing)
Fast forward to the 80s, we opened our ﬁrst Sam’s Club. We built a huge, big -- love
you, Sam’s Club. We built a few [ph] huge European style hyper markets that
eventually led to the greatest type of store ever invented, the Walmart Supercenter.
Now -- now, we're in the 90s -- now we're in the 90s and we boldly open our ﬁrst
location outside of the United States, a Sam’s Club in Mexico City, three years later,
we bring Walmart Stores to Canada. We were on our way to becoming a global
company.
Rob Walton, David Glass, Don Soderquist and others played leading roles in our
movie. We were gaining altitude.
(video playing)
But our new altitude wasn’t without turbulence, there were questions about our
ability to ﬂy.
(video playing)
Jump to April 1996, four years after Sam passed, Fortune magazine writes a story that
asks, can Walmart get [ph] back the magic? They said our business was mature. We
couldn't compete in food, and we're too ambitious with our international expansion.
It was a tough movie review.
Well, that was 26 years ago, and I'd say we've [ph] done okay since then. I keep a
hard copy -- I keep a hard copy of that magazine and read the article every once in a
while. I ﬁnd criticism motivating. They were right about our risks. Our path forward
wasn’t safe or easy. But most things we're doing aren't.
(video playing)FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 62 of 71No one told us retail would be easy. But it is great. These days, we're building
ecommerce and other digital businesses around the world. We're learning new ways
of working and using new technology to better serve our customers and members.
Our anniversary date is July 2nd, that's when we oﬃcially turn 60. I've -- I've been
here for all over half that time, and I've seen us accomplish a lot. But I truly believe
we are just getting started. As we keep working together, we'll thrive in the next
generation of retail. We'll string together more sequels than Fast and Furious.
We have a strong position with a great set of assets, a compelling plan and most
importantly, we have great people. If our revenue equaled movie ticket sales, our
box oﬃce numbers have been strong.
Over the last ﬁve years, our sales, excluding divestitures have grown by $127 billion
to $563 billion last year. You all did that. That $127 billion alone would make us in the
top 25 of the Fortune 500.
The three years before the pandemic, we grew sales an average of 3.5%, which is
faster than previous years and no small feat on our base. Our ﬁve year average
growth rate is even higher at 5.2%, including the two pandemic years.
Our operating income, excluding divestitures grew by $4.2 billion over the same
time period to $25.8 billion last year. You can see how our past investments and
higher wages, lower prices, ecommerce and technology pressurated [ph] --
pressured operating income in the years before the pandemic, but those
investments created a faster growing business. We're more relevant for customers.
We're more digital and we have a diﬀerent portfolio of countries and businesses.
The millions of digital customer relationships we've built, enabled by ecommerce
unlock opportunities to build a larger marketplace, proﬁtable fulﬁllment and delivery
services, membership income and a very proﬁtable advertising business, which
exceeded $2 billion last year. We're shaping our business model to generate a
strong return for years to come.
Check out our earnings per share performance, it was strong before the pandemic
and then jumped up quite a bit over the last couple of years. We've returned over
$64 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the
last ﬁve years. You delivered these strong results while confronting a pandemic,
working to keep yourselves and others safe.
You did it while facing more out of stocks, given the supply chain challenges than
I've ever seen. You did it with many associates on COVID leave and lots of new
associates joining you, many without retail experience. You did it with customers and
members deciding to buy all of our toilet paper at once, and then our food and then
our bikes and then all of our toilet paper again. Now, you're doing it with high
inﬂation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 63 of 71Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Doug McMillonDespite all of this, you brought our purpose to life in vivid color, you've made it real.
We recently reported our results for the ﬁrst quarter of this year. They continue to be
strong on the topline, but the bottom line was tough. We're working to ﬁx that and
improve our performance as we go through the year.
As our movie demonstrates, we're resilient and we love the challenges of retail. It's
fast paced and ever changing. Other than our purpose and values, the only thing
that is constant at Walmart is --
Change.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
-- change. Thankfully, we inherited a culture of change from Sam and those who
came before us. We're grateful to have a group of Walmart alums with us here today,
would you please help me thank them. They're seated right back here. I want to
thank you all for what you did.
I want to -- I want to highlight Claude Harris in particular. Claude worked with Sam
during the Ben Franklin days, went on to become our company’s ﬁrst buyer. Mr.
Harris, would you please give us all a wave?
Thank you, Claude. These alums were all characters in our movie and some of them
are just ﬂat out characters. They helped write a script we still follow today, creating a
string of hits like our people make the diﬀerence, everyday low price, and
satisfaction guaranteed. Beliefs and behaviors like these are foundational, they're
gifts. But perhaps, the greatest gift they gave us is the drive to experiment, to try
things, and sometimes fail, but always learn.
This ability to change gives us the opportunity to thrive into the future. So, what will
the future look like? Well, our customers and members have always wanted easy,
enjoyable access to low prices on a broad selection of quality products and services
and to do business with someone they trust. Those expectations will just keep rising
and new technologies will keep emerging and they will help us serve customers
better than ever.
When it comes selection, our US customers now have access to over 180 million
items on our app, and our assortment will keep growing. We'll keep expanding
services, with healthcare and ﬁnancial products becoming more important. Value is
always important, especially now. Selling at low prices is in our DNA, but we'll also
need a more automated supply chain and a more diversiﬁed bottom line to provide
the best value.
I am pumped about creating a more delightful experience for customers and
members. They can shop in our stores or clubs or place digital orders in a variety ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Page 64 of 71ways to save time. They can pick up an order or have it delivered. That delivery may
be to the doorstep or all the way to the fridge, whatever they want at that moment.
We have talented people from across the company working together to put all the
pieces in place from the way we use data to supply chain automation, remodel
improvements, to the way we deploy electric vehicles and ﬂy drones. You all are
transforming this company for the customer and for the future.
As we do all this, we aim to build trust. That starts with us living our value of acting
with integrity and behaving in ways that make you and your families proud. It
expands to building trust with communities. When disaster strikes, we're there with
food, water and helping hands, but you're always there, every day strengthening
communities. You and your fellow associates in the US alone, volunteer 1,000 hours a
day to causes you care about.
Last year, the company donated more than $1.5 billion in cash, food and other
products globally.
We're also working to strengthen our planet because it needs it. We care about
current and future generations and it's good business. Our goals is to become a
regenerative company, placing people and nature at the center of our business
practices. It's about more than conserving, it's about renewing and replenishing. This
includes protecting, managing and/or restoring at least 50 million acres of land and
1 million square miles of ocean by 2030.
If Doc Brown can make a DeLorean run on banana peels, just imagine what we can
do.
Last year, we kept about 80% of our waste out of landﬁlls or incineration. We're also
working to achieve zero emissions in our operations by 2040. To do so, we need to
transition our energy to 100% renewable sources. We're 36% of the way there.
Our Project Gigaton Suppliers [ph] report they’ve reduced or avoided 574 million
metric tons of greenhouse gases. That puts us halfway to our goal of reducing or
avoiding 1 billion metric tons by 2030. If you're one of those suppliers participating,
thank you all.
This type of work is not extracurricular, it's woven into the way we do business.
Having a healthy business for the long term requires healthy relationships and a
healthy planet. While our work on sustainability and our use of technology are vital
and exciting, I know it'll be the human connection you create that truly makes us
special and diﬀerent. That's why they'll choose us.

The movie starts, a team has come together to create a moment that transports you

constant goal is to put together a combination of compensation, beneﬁts like
healthcare, a 401-K, our Walmart share purchase plan, plus educational opportunities
that motivate you to want to stay and grow.
In the US, about 75% of our managers started in hourly roles. We have Walmart

Recently, the company decided to pay the full cost for tuition and books, and we

do it.
We also added new degrees in supply chain and cybersecurity. Lots of people join
the company doing one thing and end up doing all kinds of things as they build a
career. There is a path of opportunity for everyone. If there's something you want to
do, raise your hand, let your leadership know and encourage your fellow associates
to do the same.
Regardless of where you started, where you were born or your particular set of super

during that period. We're very proud of you.
Now, I want you to meet Eleanor Barnett. Eleanor is from Lynn, Massachusetts.
Eleanor is a super hero. She dresses up at work and she really kicks it up a notch for
Christmas. Check her out. I hear customers are always wanting to have their
photograph made with you, Eleanor, is that true?

To me, Eleanor represents having fun at work. Do you all have fun at work? We do to.
I mean I have fun when I'm going to stores and clubs but I also have fun just like
every day at work -- most of it is messing with Brett Biggs, and giving long hugs from
people to Breta [ph] -- we'll ﬁnd something new to do with new people or others
having --
{BIO 20285566 <GO>}
I'm called Mrs. Walmart at work.

Thank you, Eleanor. Congratulations.

Life’s too short not to have a good time, right.
Right.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
We work hard, we take our jobs seriously, we do it the right way, but have a good
time at work. When you go back to your store or club, tell everybody it's alright to
have a good time -- good clean fun, treating people with respect always, remember
that core value, but have a good time.
I love you, Doug.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I still love you too.

Page 69 of 71James CordenNow, I want you to meet Caitlin Jamieson. Caitlin is a Co-Manager from Hamilton,
Ontario. I know -- I don’t know -- okay, wait, we got to -- we're going to have lunch at
some point, alright -- I don’t know what happened to the Canadians this time, Judith
[ph], but goodness -- Caitlin uses sign language to communicate with our deaf
customers.
She also personally delivered 24 turkeys to families just in time for Christmas --
families that didn’t think they were going to get one in time and she helps women
transition from homeless shelters and other diﬃcult situations to safe and
independent lives. She's even helped some of them get a job and start their career
at Walmart. Amazing. She's a great example of making a diﬀerence.
Caitlin, just like Eleanor and Alysha, you get a star on your walk of fame. Thank you
very much and congratulations. We appreciate you -- way to go.
I wish we had time to go to every single one of you and tell your story, because I
know you've all got one. And here we are, near the end of today’s meeting and I
want you to know that we're all just so proud of all of all of you and if we could, we
would take time to hear every one of them, because you're all heroes.
When I see a great movie, I don’t want it to end. The good news is our movie is just
getting started and you're the heroes, you're the stars. You all earned your star on
our walk of fames.
Thank you all. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for your President and CEO, Doug McMillon.
A bigger round of applause than that, he is still watching you, okay? Look at all these
names, it's incredible. Do you know Doug’s ﬁrst job was at Walmart when he was 17
years old. Back then, he was laser focused on what every hot blooded, 17 year old
boy was focused on, everyday low prices.
That was in 1984, you just know Doug only took the job so he could have ﬁrst crack at
the latest pattern [ph] of parachute pants. His ﬁrst job was in warehouse number two,
unloading trucks and now he is President and CEO. It's an inspiring story. It's like
Cinderella except instead of one shoe, it's dozens of pallets of shoes.
He unloaded trucks. He's going to be the only CEO with a sign in his oﬃce that says
lift with your legs, not with your back.
Here's a fun fact, and this is true, I learned today more than 75% of the company’s
managers started out as hourly associates, which means maybe -- maybe the future
Walmart CEO is sitting in this room right here right now. And I'd like to say to that
person, yes, I will host this event again.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-03

Nick JonasI mean it, I would -- I do quite a lot of these things from time to time. As I said before,
it's the second time I've done this. There's no other company that I've ever done
anything like this for with enthusiasm, love and respect and dignity, you are a
wonderful audience, a truly incredible group of people, and it's an honor for me to
do this, and I thank you for letting me celebrate this day with you. Loved every single
second of it and I mean it, I really have.
So, this is it from me. This is the end of our show, and thank you for everything you've
done over the last few years, ever single one of you. And now, it's a real treat for you
to get up out of your seats for our headline act, ladies and gentlemen, three of the
nicest, hardest working people you could ever wish to meet, give it up for the one,
the only, it's Kevin, Nick and Joe. Here’s the Jonas Brothers, everybody.

Truly, thank you for all the love and support you've shown us in the various stages of
our career. I think we ﬁrst played here at this amazing event some 10, 12, 13 years
ago, but to be back and be able to celebrate with all of you today is such a dream,
so thank you. And what do you say we turn this into a little bit of party, come on.
Right. Let's do it.
