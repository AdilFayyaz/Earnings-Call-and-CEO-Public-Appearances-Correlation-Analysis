Started with our next presentation this morning. We are very pleased to have Zein
Abdalla, the President of PepsiCo, here with us today.
In recent quarters PepsiCo has made great strides improving the underlying
performance of its business and returning back to its long-term growth algorithm.
We look forward to hearing Zein's perspective on the business from here, as well as
the strategic and structural issues facing the Company today.
With that I will hand things over to Zein.
{BIO 15978616 <GO>}
Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. It really is a pleasure to be here with you
today and to have the opportunity to talk to you about the transformations that we
have driven at PepsiCo. But also how we are now in a position to really leverage our
global scale and drive growth going forward.
Now before I start would just like to ﬁnd the clicker. There we go. Let you take note
of our safe harbor statement. Then as I kick oﬀ, because most of my career has been
in the international business. And although I know some of you, is just to give you a
brief introduction to myself.
I spent most of my career in international, over 30 years in fast-moving consumer
goods. All of that time in food and beverages split between Mars, Incorporated,
snack foods and pet foods company. And the last half of my career with PepsiCo.
Multifunctional career; I started in engineering. I've done time in everything from
sales, marketing, human resources. And, of course, general management.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-04
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 2 of 14Before taking my current role I was the President of PepsiCo's business in Europe, a
large Power of One business, where we made signiﬁcant transformations in the
portfolio, broadening it both geographically, weighting it towards Central and
Eastern Europe, the faster growth markets; and in terms of breadth of portfolio
capturing many, many more consumer and daypart occasions.
Of course, most recently -- just under a year ago -- taking over as President of
PepsiCo. Running the global groups, that is global beverages, snacks and nutrition;
driving the marketing programs and innovation programs; and also running our
global functions that underpin the capabilities in procurement, operations, business
information systems. And corporate strategy. So that is a few sentences on me.
Now let's turn to the real subject at hand, which is PepsiCo. PepsiCo is truly a scale
company. But it is a scale company with a great track record of success. And it is a
picture of a consistent performing consumer goods company with over $65 billion in
revenue, very handsome operating margins, strong bottom-line growth and, of
course, strong shareholder returns.
Throughout 2012, our most recent full performance year, we have continued that
trajectory performance with 5% organic growth and we deliver an ROC, or return on
invested capital, of 15%.
The key thing about PepsiCo is not just the track record of success going back, it is
how well-positioned the portfolio is for growth going forward. Well-positioned both
from a category point of view.
We have a very balanced portfolio between convenient foods and beverages. And
both of these categories, convenient foods and beverages, are set to grow in the
mid-single digits when you look at them globally. So these are attractive growth
categories and we are balanced between the two.
But the other thing about our portfolio that is very well-balanced is our geographic
mix. And this is something again that we have made great strides on in the last six
years, getting a more than 10-point shift between our developed market ratio and
our developed and emerging market ratio. And developing and emerging markets
now, which for most companies account for the lion's share of projected forward
growth, now over a third of our revenues.
And our portfolio is built on incredibly strong brands. We have over 22 brands that
deliver $1 billion or better at retail sales value. But just as importantly, we have a
pipeline of powerful brands coming through what we call the future billion-dollar
brands. Over 40 brands that are in that $250 million to $1 billion retail sales value
level.
Now this would be the envy of any FMCG company and truly is peer leading. Within
that portfolio, though, more recently we have really focused on 12 global brands that
we believe capture the lion's share, not just of our current business today. But ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-04
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 14opportunity going forward. So we have power both in terms of the breadth of our
brands and the power of those brands. But also in terms of the depth and where we
can focus to drive growth going forward.
The important thing about these brands is not just their scale. But it is how well-
positioned they are competitively in each of the categories in which they compete.
Lay's is an absolute super brand in the macro snack arena and actually, in fact, Lay's
is the largest macro snack grand globally, signiﬁcantly larger than the next. It is
present virtually in every single geography across the globe and sits on an incredibly
advantaged business model.
Turning to Quaker, Quaker is one of the most respected and trusted brands in the
nutrition space globally and clearly a very strong competitive brand within the hot
cereals market. Gatorade, the most advantaged sports nutrition brand globally, with
a leading and commanding position in sports hydration.
In juice and juice drinks we have a very strong position as the number two player.
But within pure juice, within 100% juices, we actually have the market-leading
position globally. Then within carbonated soft drinks, based on brands like Pepsi and
Mountain Dew, a very strong position globally and a very strong competitive
position as the number two brand in that category.
So a powerful portfolio of brands with competitive positions. But the other thing
about our portfolio that is incredibly compelling is how broad it is in terms of serving
our consumer and customer base from a daypart, from a target group, cohort group,
the need state. And the occasion. This allows us to compete across many, many what
we call consumer demand spaces. Whether it is the mixed breakfast occasion, the
midmorning snack, the afternoon snack, or the early evening indulgence and
reward, the aperitif, we have a brand and a proposition, whether in a snack or a
beverage, in a convenient format that can satisfy the consumer demand.
And that allows us to compete across the full spectrum from physiological to
emotional needs, from nourishment needs to treat needs. This is incredibly
important for us because all consumers, all consumers, have diﬀerent need states
across the diﬀerent dayparts that cover that full spectrum.
Sometimes we misconstrue this as there is a nutrition consumer and a treat and a
reward consumer, there is no such thing. There is a single consumer who at diﬀerent
dayparts or at diﬀerent need states, diﬀerent stages in the development of their life
will consume for diﬀerent targeted reasons.
So a broad portfolio in terms of how we satisfy consumer needs. But an equally
broad portfolio from a geographic base. We operate in more than 200 countries
globally. That is largely operating across both our snack and our beverage business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-04
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 4 of 14In many of those geographies we operate our snack and beverage businesses as
consolidated businesses. And certainly in every single geography those businesses
leverage each other for scale, for competing for talent. And developing capabilities
to win in the marketplace.
Just like we have competitive position within our brands and categories, we have
competitive positions from a geographic point of view as well. We have the number
one food and beverage company -- we are the number one food and beverage
company across a number of highly strategic markets, like the US, Russia, India,
Egypt -- all very high growth potential markets going forward. And a very strong
number two position in markets like the UK and Mexico. So we are very well-
positioned competitively geographically as well.
Then when you think about the (world of) PepsiCo in each of these geographies, in
other words you think about our total system. So our partner systems, we actually
occupy the number one position in other strategic geographies like China. Our
recent re-franchising in China, developing the partnership with the Tingyi company,
gives us the number one food and beverage company in that geography by some
order of magnitude. And China, as you all know, is going to be the single largest
driver of growth for any FMCG company going forward.
Even in the UK, where when you combine us with our bottling partner Britvic we
have the number one food and beverage company, again by some order of
magnitude, which is critically important in a highly consolidated trade environment.
Then in Brazil, as a result of our scale partnership with ABI, we have the number two
food and beverage position. So again, very competitively well-placed from a
geographic point of view.
The other thing that is compelling about our categories and how we bring them
together is just how complementary they are to each other. Whether in foods or in
beverages, we operate in branded, impulse, high velocity categories and these
categories share many characteristics across our consumer customer, from a market
characteristic base. And of course, the capabilities that underpin their development.
There is a very high level of coincidence of both purchase and consumption
between snacks and beverages. And when we look at it from a capability point of
view, whether it is procurement, brand building, R&D, innovation, methodology, or
even in many, many developing and emerging markets our whole go-to-market
system capability, there is much, much to share between these categories.
All of that results in signiﬁcant synergies that exist across this portfolio. These are
synergies, whether you look at it from a cost point of view, capability point of view, or
the share top-line commercial beneﬁts that you can drive.
Looking at it from a cost point of view, the very obvious one I have already touched
on is procurement. We buy across categories for each of our food and beverage
businesses and when you think about that relative scale position and the partnershipFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-04
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 5 of 14philosophy that we can drive with many vendors and the strategic preferred supplier
status we can get as a result of that you can see the beneﬁt of a combination of these
portfolios.
But equally the cost leverage comes in terms of driving common infrastructure,
common corporate functions, common back oﬃce. And wherever we can share we
share.
The second clear thing is about capability building. Here again, one that maybe not
so obvious but is a huge driver for us is R&D capability that can be shared -- long-
term R&D capability that can be shared across both food and beverages.
Things that are incredibly common across these two platforms or across these two
categories is that taste and convenience drive consumer preference. The science
behind taste and convenience can be leveraged, whether it is in the form of
sweetener technology, in the form of texture, in the form of product formulation, for
cost. All of these are beneﬁts from an R&D point of view that can be driven across
both categories.
But equally, there is plenty in capability around go-to-market. Joint planning
methodology with key customers, how do you approach the organized trade most
eﬃciently -- these are all again capabilities that can be shared between our beverage
and snack businesses.
Then the third block, of course, is the share commercial beneﬁt that you can get as a
result of leveraging that coincidence of both purchase and consumption between
snacks and beverages. We are the largest supplier to the US retail trade and we have
nine -- in food and beverages -- and we have nine out of the 40 top trademarks. So
when a retailer is looking for growth in the US, PepsiCo is a very logical partner for
them to play their activity and to coordinate their activity with.
We can leverage a lot of our joint properties, whether it is our football properties,
baseball, basketball, or hockey, around occasion. So the whole how we bring it to life
and activate it within store. It is not just in retail. But also in food service. The strength
and the penetration of our beverage business in food service allows us to develop
(these growth) propositions for our snack business and get higher penetration for
our snacks in food service.
So clearly, a signiﬁcant commercial beneﬁt as a result of the consistency of the
characteristics of these two categories.
Now turning to the transformation journey that we have been on. I have already
touched on the ﬁrst two, which is how we broaden our portfolio to make sure that we
capture that much broader set of needs -- of consumer need states. Not just the treat
and indulgence, the fun-for-you side of the business. But also the more nutrition-
based side of the business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-04
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 14How we have evolved our geographic footprint to make sure that we not only have
our strong developed market base and strengths and the capabilities that come
from those. But how we leverage those capabilities to drive much faster growth in
developing and emerging markets. And as a result of that a much more balanced
global footprint.
So as a result of those two changes now we are very well-positioned for growth.
Then the third underpinner, of course, is how do we, as a company, get much more
leverage as a result of our scale. We have historically had a very strong market-by-
market -- optimizing our business market by market and now we are looking to keep
that entrepreneurial spirit, keep that strength market by market. But get much more
horizontal leverage as a result of the way we connect these businesses globally.
From there we are really focused against that topic on ﬁve properties. First of all is
how do we get leverage and synergies in our global brand building. So instead of
campaign by campaign, country by country, how do we get the platform of global
campaigns that can be made truly locally relevant? A phrase that we use which is a
global campaign built oﬀ global properties, global positioning. But entirely locally
relevant.
Again, as a result of cutting horizontally, how do we amplify our innovation processes
so that we don't just drive refresh innovation, which is important and has a very
important role to play in the highly impulse sensitive categories, because refresh
innovation gives you news, gives you display space. But how do we build on that as a
result of scaling up our approach to innovation to get much more refresh, reframe.
And breakthrough type innovation.
On execution, as I have mentioned, we have optimized locally and we execute
market by market. But how do we continue to do that. But also get a much better
sharing of global best practices so we get much more leverage across the globe for
our execution.
We have a great track record of continuous improvement on productivity. A phrase
that we have used to describe that is making sure that we make every penny a
prisoner within our business. But how do we evolve from that to freeing up what we
called trapped dollars by really reinvigorating and adapting and evolving our
business model to free up costs that can be reinvested in the business?
Of course, all of this underpinned by an incredible discipline on capital location so
that we can generate cash returns and increase the returns to our shareholders. So
let me just touch on each of those brieﬂy.
First of all, global brand building. One of the things that we have done across the
last 12 months is harmonize our global brand building model. So for each of those 12
global brands we start with a common framework, what we call our global brand
positioning wheel, which ensures global consistency that allows us then to drive
these global campaigns and get much more global leverage.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-04
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 7 of 14What it means is we can shift a lot more of our advertising and marketing from
nonworking to working, because we can reduce production costs. We can drive
things like new platforms like digital much more rapidly because we can take them
globally much more rapidly. And I will give you some examples of that.
Then within global brand building also how do we make sure that there is science
that underpins the art form of this. That there is a very disciplined set of metrics in
place that we can continuously reﬁne and improve where we invest and how we
invest. And we use a number of both input and output metrics to drive the decision-
making process here.
On the input, how competitive are we from a share of voice, how rich is our
innovation pipeline. And how much of our revenue is being driven by innovation. But
from an output both a short-term measure of return on investment to how much
uplift do we get in our brand programs as a result of the advertising and marketing
investment. But we don't just drive the decisions based on short-term ROI, because
clearly we are looking for the long-term brand building equity which is what we
focus on as a long-term ROI measure over advertising and marketing eﬀectiveness.
Turning to innovation. Again, what we have done recently led by our Frito-Lay
business in North America is to drive a proprietary way of deﬁning that consumer
opportunity, what we call our consumer demand space framework.
What we have taken is literally millions of consumption occasions and the drivers of
those consumption occasions and used them to map how does a consumer make a
decision about what to buy and consume against the diﬀerent demand spaces.
Demand space is deﬁned by who that consumer is, the occasion on which they are
making that decision and having that consumption. And clearly the who, the target
group of who that consumer is.
What this has allowed us to do is make sure that our innovation is synergistic so that
we don't get overlapped either in terms of our brand or the innovation we drive.
That the innovation is very clearly targeted against what are those biggest
opportunities by consumer demand space, what we call unmet needs that exist in
the marketplace today. And of course, where there is opportunity, because there is a
common demand space between our beverage and snack business but how do we
solve for it holistically across both food and beverages.
The result of this approach and the underpinning capabilities is that we now have a
global portfolio pipeline of innovation that we have transparency to across the whole
company that means that we can drive fewer. But bigger, better innovations. So we
are placing a lot of activity with more focused, bigger groundbreaking type,
innovation type initiatives.
We have underpinned it with a very clear global stage gate process, which again
gives transparency across the globe. So somebody sat in Australia can see what
recently worked in the US and this accelerates the whole lift and adapt. It means thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-04
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 8 of 14we can get innovation for many of those 200 markets simply and purely as a result of
what they can lift from other scale-adjacent markets.
We can drive for global platforms rather than one-oﬀ innovation initiatives, which
means that as something works we can take the technology that underpins it and
leverage that technology more broadly against more demand spaces. And ﬁnally,
the global capabilities around R&D and introducing new capabilities like the design-
led innovation capability at PepsiCo, which allows us now to generate consumer
propositions that are much more rich, much more rewarding. And much more
holistic from inception right the way through to execution.
And pitching on some examples of this, Trop 50, which was a lighter orange juice
that was launched and has been incredibly successful in the US, has now been rolled
out to the UK and Western Europe and is proving to be equally successful there. But
lift and adaptive is not just about product innovation it is also about innovation in
consumer engagement.
So Do Us a Flavor, which has just recently been executed in the US, was an initiative
that started about ﬁve years ago in the UK and has now been launched across
multiple markets. Taking the same digital engagement platform, the same way of
engaging the consumer across an involvement in designing and developing the
optimum Lay's and building a program around it.
Looking at scalable innovation platforms, Kickstart is a great example of this. We
launched Kickstart Your Day, a morning proposition for Millennials who would rather
drink a Mountain Dew proposition than a coﬀee. And this has proved incredibly
successful, building a greater than $100 million business in its ﬁrst year of launch.
But again, thinking about that as a platform, Kickstart Your Day can equally translate
into Kickstart Your Night. And that will follow leveraging, again, a lot of the same
technology but tapping a diﬀerent consumer demand space.
As we stand today one of the things that we feel really good about when we look
back across the last couple of years is how much richer now our innovation pipeline
is as we stand today than it was then as a result of rolling out our global model.
The third priority is execution this has always been something that PepsiCo has been
outstanding at, as well as being something that is incredibly important and
underpinned for the success of our business. And it is execution across the whole
value chain, right the way from plan and buy to make, move. And sell.
What we are doing now is making sure that we can transfer best practice across each
of these pillars and make sure that what we have that is competitively advantaged
pillar by pillar can transfer between markets -- can be transferred between markets
very rapidly.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-04
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 9 of 14I have touched again on procurement, how we buy globally. But it is also about
innovation within the whole procurement supply chain. On make, clearly there are
diﬀerent make requirements between snacks and beverages. But there are a lot of
common processes in terms of things like sanitation, maintenance, benchmarking for
eﬃciency, Lean Six Sigma. There are many best practices that can be leveraged
across plants that have diﬀerent category responsibilities.
Move, we can now deploy a whole host of both third-party supply logistics solutions.
Again, in many of the developing and emerging markets getting scale and leverage
between the categories. But also in markets where we have diﬀerent separate go-to-
market systems between snacks and beverages, how do we leverage the capabilities
such as things like handheld devices, the underpinning technology, which are
equally applicable across both categories, to make sure that our route system is as
eﬃcient as possible.
And of course, in terms of selling, joint approach to the organized trade but equally
building selling capabilities that are consistent in the up and down (discrete)
businesses across our emerging and developing markets. There is probably no
better example of where we have done this holistically in the PepsiCo business than
Russia, where we have pulled together all four businesses -- our beverage business,
our juice business, our snack business. And our dairy business -- and operate as a
fully integrated Power of One business.
This has given us a really commanding position in the marketplace. It is our largest
business globally outside of North America. We have a two-to-one advantage
relative to the nearest competitor. And if you think about it in terms of growth for the
retail trade, 10 out of the top 25 brands are PepsiCo brands across that breadth of
portfolio.
From the cost side of the equation, this integration has allowed us to drive over $100
million worth of operating synergies as we have harmonized everything across that
value supply chain. But much more importantly, it has allowed us to develop new
capabilities to accelerate growth; building out R&D capabilities, go-to-market
capabilities through a mosaic of diﬀerent go-to-market systems to tackle the
diﬀerent trade channels; and, of course, probably one of the most important
capabilities in a developing and emerging market, an ability to attract talent really
ahead of any other company.
The importance about all of this platform for Russia is not just to serve the Russian
market but to serve the geography that is contiguous to Russia. So it is not about the
140 million consumer base in Russia. But it is about the 400 million consumer base
that is in the Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, etc.
Another great example of execution and execution as we pulled together Power of
One is the Bring Happiness Home campaign that we ran in China. Again, not any
one of our single businesses could have done this. But when you put Pepsi together
with Lay's together with Tropicana we were able to produce a ﬁlm that tapped intoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-04
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 10 of 14one of the biggest emotions in China because a lot of the migrant population labor
forces -- how do you get and encourage people to come home to celebrate Chinese
New Year?
We tapped into the whole emotion of that occasion and built this digital ﬁlm that got
over 700 million views without a single dollar of media spend. And that is just a
phenomenal thing that you can do as a result of pulling these categories together.
The fourth priority is productivity. I have touched on this right the way through. But
really we drive it against this, of course, three big buckets. Clearly, productivity in our
operations, what we call there driving to zero. Through automation, zero touches;
both automation of our manufacturing and automation of our wire housing. And
how do we amplify our asset utilization.
Commodities, innovating within the whole supply chain how do we reduce -- work
with our vendors to reduce the amount of raw material that we use. But also to
reduce their conversion costs of producing that raw material by making decisions
early in our conversion process.
In A&M also we have a huge productivity drive which is about not cutting the A&M.
We want to clearly spend more A&M. But how do we make sure two things -- one
that it is spent on the right things, a shift in nonworking to working. And then when
we spend it we spend it in the most eﬀective way possible.
Then our ﬁfth priority is returning cash to our investors. Here we have a very strong
track record, returning over $53 billion worth of cash across the last decade and that
is continuing in 2013 as we return $6.4 billion worth of cash to our investors this year.
A big driver of that has been our discipline around capital allocation and how we
view our capital allocation. And we really have for very clear priorities there.
The ﬁrst. And without the shadow of a doubt the ﬁrst is we are going to invest in our
business. But we are going to do that in a very disciplined way. We are going to
maintain our capital investment in the business at less than 5% of our revenue. And I
can tell you every single one of the investments that we make as we take it through
our CapEx process delivers a return far better than the cost of capital and ampliﬁes
our ROIC.
The second priority is what we have touched on, is paying dividends and returning
cash to our shareholders. The third, as we look at our strategic priorities across the
globe, is what tuck-in acquisitions will strengthen our portfolio from a category. But
just as importantly from a geographic point of view. But only tuck-ins.
Then the fourth priority is how do we return additional cash to our shareholders
through share repurchases. So four very clear priorities and when we sum these up
against the growth of our business we can see clearly a roadmap to improving our
ROIC by on average 50 basis points each year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-04
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 11 of 14Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Zein Abdalla
Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantThen when you sum all of those ﬁve priorities together and we execute against them
we feel that we are very well-positioned to deliver top-tier, long-term performance in
a very sustainable manner for many years to come. Top-tier performance as a result
of the very clear strategies that we have that drive that mid-single digit revenue
growth, organic revenue growth on the basis of these categories that we compete
within and the diversity of our geographic base. Then how that translates into top-
tier ﬁnancial performance across our earnings and across the cash that we return to
our shareholders.
All of this clearly underpinned by our brand building, innovation, our ﬂexible
approach to supply chain and the costs that we can drive out of that. And building
world-class talent. And of course, leveraging the power of one which I have touched
on right the way through this presentation.
So pulling it all together what I hope you walk away from this discussion with is that
clearly we have a signiﬁcant opportunity ahead of us in terms of the strength of our
portfolio and the growth that it maps out for us. And that we are well-positioned to
realize that growth as a result of our ability to leverage our global scale. But maintain
that local focus and execution. How we can build brands and global innovation with
a very disciplined approach to our investments and how Power of One is a
signiﬁcant enabler for us across the business because of the synergies that exist
between our categories.
With that let me pause there and take any questions.
Questions And Answers
Zein, over the past year you have obviously signiﬁcantly stepped up your brand
investments. Now as you evaluate that spending how does that scorecard look in
terms of the returns you generated and the growth delivery. And more importantly,
what does that assessment inform you about the rate of investments going forward?
{BIO 15978616 <GO>}
We are very encouraged by the progress we have made on the investment, both in
brand building and innovation. And we are starting to see that come through very
well to our top line. What I would say, though, is that it's also as a result of the
measure that we put in place, a continuous improvement process as well. Because
what we are looking to do is deﬁne what generates the highest returns against those
demand spaces and how do we then reﬁne our investments going forward.
But whether I look at it from some of the output measures, like share progression,
building of brand equity, innovation as a percentage of revenue, I would say against
each of those metrics we have made signiﬁcant progress.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-04

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantIf we could just take a look at your developing and emerging markets, clearly there
macros have led to some slowdown. If you could perhaps update us on the
performance of your businesses, particularly in the critical high-growth markets that
you have targeted such as China. And what you are doing in those markets
speciﬁcally in the current environment.
{BIO 15978616 <GO>}
As you will have seen in the presentation that I went through developing and
emerging markets are a critical growth enabler for us and we have done well in
developing and emerging markets across many years. Now, emerging and
developing markets are volatile so you have to take a long-term perspective on
them.
If I dial just through some of them, you highlighted China. Our re-franchising to
Tingyi in China has gone exceptionally well. Despite some of the slowdowns in the
China GDP we are driving tremendous growth there, peer-leading growth. And very
strong performance in the China market.
Russia, again, is a market where there has been some slowdown in GDP growth. But
we are performing strongly and our top line is doing well. Dialing across the rest of
the emerging markets Brazil is one that again has had a pretty big correction in GDP
growth rates, coming down to low single digits, even potentially ﬂat. And in Brazil we
have a smaller beverage business but we have a very strong and powerful snack
business and we are actually seeing very strong performance across our snack
business as we expand into some of those new demand spaces, adjacent spaces in
the broader macro snack arena.
India, again, more challenged, where a combination of both GDP slowing down and
ForEx have proved more challenging. But again, India is a tremendous long-term
growth market. So we remain very conﬁdent about the role that developing and
emerging markets can play in our long-term growth the equation. But it is about
managing the balance between your developed and developing and emerging
markets because they will remain more volatile.
Who would have predicted a few years ago that the Middle East would be where it is
today? Now we have a very strong management team there. They know how to
operate in the current environment and they know how to lead their business for the
right way of running at the right time. But you have to be prepared to take those
events when they come.
You spent much of the presentation pointing out the scale of the business and the
complementary and synergistic features of the businesses -- beverage, snacks and
nutrition. Nonetheless, as you think about the structure of the Company and
obviously you have talked about that assessment, what are the more recent
performance drivers of your business telling you about what is the optimum
structure for PepsiCo over the long-term?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-04

Page 13 of 14A - Zein Abdalla
Q - Michael Branca{BIO 15978616 <GO>}
We think we have got an incredibly powerful portfolio and that this portfolio is very
well geared for long-term growth. We do think that a signiﬁcant part of our growth
going forward will come out of developing and emerging markets. And it is really
important to be well-positioned to capture that growth. In the developing and
emerging markets the synergies that come out of scale are really important. So
structurally there it is very important for us to have all of those beneﬁts that I talked
to you about between snack and our beverage businesses.
Look at it from a category point of view, clearly the good for you end of the spectrum
has tailwinds rather than headwinds. Tailwinds both from a regulatory point of view
as well as from a consumer point of view. We see that as a growth opportunity going
forward. But defensively and more importantly from an opportunity. So the nutrition
category will be a real driver for our growth.
But global snacks, where we really compete today largely in core salty or in salty
snacks, has tremendous opportunity to source occasions, those demand space
occasion, from adjacencies. Both in broader savory snack propositions. But as well as
in broader macro snack. So salty has a signiﬁcant growth opportunity for it.
And beverages globally is a 5% growth category. It is a much more challenging
category in North America. But the North American business gives us scale and gives
us capabilities to compete internationally. Things like whether it is sweetener
technology, whether it is the global campaigns that I talked about, you need the
scale of the operating business of North America to drive.
So we think our portfolio holistically is very well positioned from a portfolio point of
view. Productivity though and driving the operating model from a business model
point of view is something that we will continuously examine and continuously look
at ﬁnding what is the most eﬃcient and optimum way of realizing the potential of
that total portfolio.
