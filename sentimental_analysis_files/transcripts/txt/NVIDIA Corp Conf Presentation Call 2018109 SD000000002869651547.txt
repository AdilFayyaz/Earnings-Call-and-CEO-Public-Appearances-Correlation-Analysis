All right. Well I'm going to get started a couple of minutes early because I just
wanted to say -- well, ﬁrst of all. Good morning. And Happy New Year. And thank you
to all of you. Welcome to JPMorgan's 16th Annual Technology Forum here at the
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. My name is Harlan Sur. I'm the
semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment analyst here for the ﬁrm. And
we're very pleased to have a solid day of semiconductor, automotive, automotive
technology and general tech companies presenting. Also joining me from JPMorgan
are some of my colleagues. I've got Bill Peterson, who covers the RF semiconductor
value chain. We've got my colleagues, Ryan Brinkman, JosÃ© Asumendi and Samik
Chatterjee who cover the U.S. and European automotive sectors; and Paul Coster,
our applied and emerging technologies analyst.
Now over the past few years, CES has been much less focused on things like mobile
devices and PCs and much more focused on things like intelligent cars, the
proliferation of deep learning and artiﬁcial intelligence, smart connected homes,
smart factory ﬂoor and next-generation gaming technology. Now especially in
automotive, given the increasing intelligence and semiconductor content, we've
included a number of the top-tier OEMs and subsystems companies who will talk
about their technology development eﬀorts. And this year, for the ﬁrst time, we have
companies like Ford, GM, Daimler, Continental, Aptiv, Autoliv to name a few. So we
hope you enjoy the conference. And thank you for your participation. Hopefully, you
guys will be asking a lot of questions. Remember, this conference is for you.
And with that, I'm pleased to introduce Colette Kress. She is the Chief Financial
Oﬃcer of NVIDIA. It's been a tradition, the last few years, to have the NVIDIA team
kick oﬀ our investor conference because the team is driving much of the trends that
you will hear about today: artiﬁcial intelligence and deep learning, next-generation
compute architectures in automotive and next-generation gaming technology. The
team had their press conference on Sunday. I've asked Colette to start us oﬀ with an
overview of what Jensen unveiled Sunday night. And then we'll kick oﬀ the Q&A. So
with that, Colette, thank you very much for joining us this morning.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-09

Thank you. Thank you, Harlan. So welcome. If you didn't get a chance to see our
press announcements on Sunday night, I'll do a tiny bit -- a quick recap. We did start
with a summary, what we have seen over this last year, it's been a year since the last
CES, in terms of building, in terms of our automotive. And we added more, in terms
of this time.
Probably one of the key things that we started oﬀ with was to talk about the
availability of our Xavier SoC. Now our Xavier SoC is engineered for AI, for
automotive. So it's very important part for us to establish this, with sampling for our
overall customers. This is a big breakthrough that we think is probably more than two
years ahead of any type of competition in terms of the SOCs for the automotive. It
improves in terms of energy eﬃciency 10x probably from our prior version. And it is
looked at in terms of an overall wattage of less than 30 watts, which we think is
uniquely engineered for AR cars moving forward.
So with that, in terms of the basis of what we had, we went on to talk about some of
our key additional partnerships that we are working on in terms of automotive as we
move forward. The ﬁrst one that we announced is with Uber. Uber is using the
NVIDIA DRIVE platform for its self-driving cars and was with us and is continuing to
build more and more data from the roads in what they are collecting using our
overall platform going forward.
Secondly, we announced a terms of work with Volkswagen. Volkswagen is looking to
use our platform inside the car for an overall copilot. We're thinking about the AI
inside the car, using anything from voice recognition, gestures and others and in
terms of to help keep the driver focused in terms of on the road. But also being able
to add AI with, inside the car.
Thirdly, we announced a collaboration with Baidu and ZF that they will also use our
DRIVE platform for future automotive AI cars. All right?
Then fourthly, Aurora, a start-up, focused on self-driving cars will also use our DRIVE
platform.
This adds to many of the additional partnerships that we've already announced and
continues to be solidiﬁed with all the diﬀerent people that we work with. We have
probably more than 320 diﬀerent automotive partners, Tier 1s, OEMs as well as start-
ups that we are working with, which has increased from probably about 250 from
where we were about a year ago. So we are continuing our work in what is a very
important area of the transportation transformation as we see forward. This is a big
area where a business more than $10 trillion is going through a massive
transformation, a transformation in terms of both the technology but the overall
ability to use AI in terms of in the car.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-09

Page 3 of 11Q - Harlan Sur
A - Colette M. KressSo those were most of our announcements. We also announced key things with our
overall gaming. We have big-format gaming displays with our G-SYNC monitors, 65-
inch that you could probably come to the convention center and see our big screen
types of formats. These actually improve the overall latency with very, very large
monitors for those AAA games.
We've also continued to talk about our GeForce NOW. GeForce NOW also right now
is in beta with our overall Mac users and also in the future coming in terms with our
overall PC users. This is an ability to expand overall cloud gaming that can overall
stream to any types of device.
So those are some the great announcements that we had as of Sunday night.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Great. Well thank you, for those opening remarks. And I think one of the key
takeaways for me from the press conference on Sunday was Jensen's sort of
summary of accomplishments in 2017. And his key takeaway was that, look, NVIDIA
developed end-to-end AI, deep learning platforms, software, ﬁrmware enablers for
your entire customer base, right, whether that's the cloud service providers, whether
that's enterprise, whether that's researchers, end-to-end platform: hardware,
software, ﬁrmware and support. And I think that -- and obviously, much of that is
focused on the training side of AI and deep learning. And I think the market
understands that NVIDIA does lead the way when it comes to AI deep learning
training. The other part of the equation though, is on the inferencing side. And back
in the May analyst conference, you sized the inferencing market as about a $15 billion
market opportunity, even bigger than the training side of the market. And I often feel
like the market doesn't appreciate NVIDIA's leadership on the inferencing side. You
have the TensorRT platform, which is the platform that helps you take the training
network, optimize it and then put it into the inferencing platform. So you've got that.
You actually have hardware solutions that enable inferencing with Jetson platform,
which is for embedded solutions like drones or factory automation or edge
computing. Then again, I don't think people realize that your highly successful DRIVE
PX, DRIVE Xavier platforms are inferencing platforms as well. And so I think as you --
as the team thinks about the inferencing side of the market, well, what are you --
what else is the team doing to continue to expand their presence and leadership on
the inferencing side?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So a good way to think about what we have developed in many times looking
at AI and our work in terms of AI really focus in terms of the starts, in terms of the
data center. So those expanded quite strongly. It is really not just about the overall
processor or the overall (chip) we have designed in terms of data center. The key
important part that you spoke there is it is a full stock. It is a full stock, starting with
the best processor on the planet, the best processor in terms of its overall
capabilities. But it is uniquely positioned to expand and work in terms of with AI. AI isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 11Q - Harlan Sur
A - Colette M. Kressabout signiﬁcant amount of data. We need a processor to be able to handle that
(inaudible). But most importantly, there is also the signiﬁcant amount of
development work, the development software that is necessary. We keep an overall
development platform consistent across every single one of the products (that we
overall shelf) . Both within the data center, both in terms of automotive as well as on
the edge, inferencing or anything (may lead) to in terms of deep learning (in the
center) of the overall data center. This is an important piece because there'd be
more than 650,000 developers that are working on CUDA that they can have that
consistency of that overall software platform (inaudible). But then that gets into our
ability to further up that stack from that overall (buildware) to where we can actually
help with the overall application and the use of our (inaudible) platform. You see that
spin-oﬀ that we have in terms of -- with automotive. And we have the entire business
focused on AI for automotive. When you think about that, that's not just automotive
and thinking about the platforms that will be in the car. We're working with them
today. We're working with them today in the data center. They're collecting
signiﬁcant amount of data on the road. They are using that in their data centers.
They're using our overall platforms in their data centers to process in terms of all that
data. So that we can get to a form factor that would be actually in the production
cars. Xavier is that. Xavier is essentially inferencing inside the vehicle (actually
moving forward). So our whole plan is to really think about democratizing AI as best
as we can across many of the industries. We have chosen key industries that we think
are very ripe to take advantage of the overall AI as we move forward. So yes,
inferencing is a big focus of ours as long -- as well as in deep learning training. Yes.
We started many years ago in terms of deep learning training. And we still hold a
signiﬁcant amount of market share regarding the overall deep learning and deep
learning training. But inferencing is a great opportunity because of the overall
complexity of inferencing that we'll see moving forward. The overall inferencing is
much more advanced than what may have been seen in terms of 10 years ago in
terms of inferencing, which is primarily a CPU market. The overall ability to now use
diﬀerent form factors as well as using the GPU to take advantage of that overall
inferencing opportunity is right for us to (inaudible).
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Any other end markets -- Jetson, your embedded platform targets things like
factories and drones; DRIVE PX, obviously, strong in the automotive markets. Any
other areas where you can think of which can take advantage on the inferencing side
of NVIDIA's capabilities, both on the silicon and on the platform side?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Well probably, ﬁrst one to see -- very similar to what we saw in terms of deep
learning that your cloud service providers will be getting that, (will be getting) that in
terms of whether they use it for internal usage in terms of their applications or they
make it available in terms of with the cloud for others to take advantage. We'll still
see in terms of key industries. But it's probably the exact same industries that are
very focused right now in terms of the overall training market that we see. We've
been focused in terms of on manufacturing. We've been focused on robotics. We've
been focused on health care. We've been focused on the ﬁnancial industry. These
are very important things. One of the things that you see that keeps all thoseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 11Q - Harlan Sur

Q - Harlan Surindustries all together is the signiﬁcant amount of data and their ability to apply AI to
that to quickly -- (or to some of the answer if needed).
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Great. Well let's focus on the other big announcements on Sunday, which was the
new DRIVE platforms or your DRIVE Xavier, DRIVE IX, DRIVE Pegasus. And again,
turning back to your analyst meeting back in May, I think the head of your auto
business sort of put a dollar content opportunity per automotive for NVIDIA kind of
2020 -- 2025 time frame anywhere from $500 to $1,000 per car, Level 5 being
$1,000 of opportunity for NVIDIA per automotive. And my sense was that back in
May, that was just focused on the core DRIVE platforms, right, like DRIVE PX, DRIVE
PX 2, DRIVE Xavier. But Jensen and you and the team announced another platform
on Sunday, which is DRIVE IX, right, which is this compute and GPU platform which
senses driver and passenger behavior, takes that behavioral information, maps it into
the other functionality that's coming from your DRIVE PX platforms. And with that,
the car is now able to actually make more intelligent decisions about what should
the car be doing next, right? Then you also have -- you also announced another
platform which was -- I think it was called Drive -- was it DRIVE AR, which is enabling
richer content within the infotainment system as well. And so my sense is that these
kinds of opportunities are not included in the dollar content opportunity that you
laid out in May. Am I correct in that? Or do you have a sense of -- with all of these
new platforms, has your dollar content opportunity per auto actually increased now
as you think about it over the next kind of 3 to ﬁve years?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. The overall view that we had taken with our Analyst Day back in May is to really
help people understand that the change in terms of where the dollars are in the car
will likely change. There's a huge opportunity in terms of the ability to add the
technology in there and move from the actual driver and the overall value that the
driver has to the overall car. So you're not looking at extrapolating it from the overall
tires and toward the steering wheel. You're actually looking to say, how do I add in
terms of the value of that technology from the overall driver? These are all things that
can overall improve both safety and improve just the overall experience inside the
car. Now we are still in the early stages looking in terms of the next several years in
terms of what those price points are, what do we think the overall value that we can
(inaudible). It's still very early. But we do believe, based on where we are today in
terms of just high-end infotainment systems, infotainment systems, which will be
infused with AI going forward, whether that be the augmented reality or whether
that be just used inside of the car with the driver and the passengers, can
signiﬁcantly increase the overall value of (inaudible) infotainment system. Then when
we talk about what will occur outside of the car in terms of gathering that data,
processing that data that is either, a, a Level 3, a Level 4, a Level 5, you're right, you
have an overall exponential growth into the overall value that we can actually
extrapolate and probably from overall price points. But there's signiﬁcant amount of
work in terms of software development between here today and what we'll see into
the next couple of years.

Q - Harlan SurGreat. Why don't we change it up a little bit? I continue to like the core business,
which is the gaming business. It's near and dear to my heart. My son is a big
enthusiast gamer. Your gaming business is going to be up greater than 30%
calendar year '17, continue to remain relatively unchallenged at the high end of the
enthusiast gaming segment. The GeForce 1080 Ti platform continues to lead the
pack in terms of gaming performance. The Pascal architecture has been a huge
success. That being said, the enthusiast community is anxiously awaiting the launch
of the GeForce 20-Series platform this year. Some speculate it may not be Volta
based. It might be another architecture called Ampere. Can you maybe give us a
sneak peek on the 20-Series platform launch and architecture?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. I always love that we come here and (talk) about our next-generation products.
And I think you just tried to name our next product in terms of that. But I'll take that
back to the (team and review) and agree that we should call it the 20-Series. But I
didn't know we were naming the products onstage. But we can take that into
consideration. But we don't generally talk about new products. We'd love to (excite)
on the consumer side, (win) our overall (inaudible). So what I can discuss, though, is
yes, that overall success of the Pascal. The overall success of the Pascal, very similar
to our prior versions in terms of we usually keep our architecture (inaudible) for a
couple of years. We continue to dazzle them with new product launches across that,
which you've seen us do in terms of new products that we brought out on the Pascal.
You are correct, we probably have the majority -- more than the majority, a very
sizable amount of the overall market as we both have the loyalty of the gamers, we
have the overall performance that they require to play their high production (value)
games. The AAA games that came out for the holiday season, many of them were
top star games and many people spent a lot of their holidays doing that. But keep in
mind, we're not done with our holiday season. We are maybe at the tail end of it
here in the U.S.. But there are holidays across the world where we continue to see
the ability for them to take advantage of the overall Pascal. Our overall goal is not
just in terms of upgrading the most current. People that may have our prior version
but we're also here for those that have been with us for several generations. And this
is a great opportunity for them probably to take advantage of Pascal as we move
forward. Now when you think about our uniﬁed architecture across the company,
what we mean by that is we use the same architecture across every single one of our
businesses. So essentially, what we have in gaming, what we have in automotive,
what we have in data center is all the (same) overall architecture. But keep in mind,
we make sure that we create (parts) or we create chips that are most eﬃciently and
eﬀective for the overall markets that we will serve. So yes, you could look at some of
the things that we have done in data center. But we are going to concentrate on the
gamers in terms of what they need for the overall (concept that we'll have).
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
So 1080 Ti -- you have the 1080 Ti GeForce platform. We rolled out the 1070 Ti.
Combined that with, as you mentioned, the second half of last year, which had a
number of huge blockbuster games. And obviously, that's driving the strength in the
GeForce business. But the interesting thing is that if we look at the ﬁrst half of this
year, there's actually more -- it's -- we're not seeing the normal seasonal pattern.
There's actually more AAA blockbuster games coming out in the ﬁrst half of thisFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-09

Q - Harlan Suryear: Far Cry 5, for example, hugely popular, launching in March; Metro Exodus,
which is another one launching later on this year as well. Does this potentially extend
the customer buying cycle a bit, maybe smooth out the seasonality for the GeForce
platform?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So generally, our seasonality in terms of overall gaming as it relates to GeForce has
generally been centered around in H1 and in H2. I would say that our H2 is probably
a larger overall size than H1 due to seasonality. What that means is with the holidays,
you're right, most games do hit the holiday season. This is an opportunity to buy a
gift and all those diﬀerent types of things and spend the time overall (paying) for
those around holidays. So yes, that seasonality says that we see still probably we'll
see that overall seasonality continue. Sure, new games have always come out,
sometimes outside of that holiday window, which they come from time to time,
sometimes in Q1, sometimes in Q2. So that doesn't overall surprise us. But no, we still
do expect the overall seasonality (inaudible).
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Well let me see if there's any questions from the audience before I
continue my Q&A. Any questions from the audience? If you do, raise your hand. And
I would ask if you just wait for the microphone. Okay, no? Let's turn to -- let's turn
back to the data center and the HPC business. Tesla V100 compute platform, Volta
architecture, huge performance boost versus Pascal-based architecture, 12-
nanometer technology, biggest chip in the world. Demand has been strong. Has the
team been able to keep up with demand? Have you been able to improve yields and
overall manufacturability of this monster chip? And are you shipping to consumption
now?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. We've actually deﬁnitely been able to keep up with demand. I think we were
extremely pleased with the process that the company went through. You're right, it is
the largest chip that has been built. Our ability to get from just the initial takeout to
actually seeing it with customers to actually getting to an ideal yield that we can still
move in terms of top production. It's probably some of the fastest (inaudible) that
we've seen. We're extremely pleased with all of the teams and all of the partners that
enabled us to overall do that. So yes, we have been, probably since Q2, shipping at
full production in terms of V100. And demand continues in terms of the overall V100
across the board, both at the CSPs as well as also worldwide in terms of (inaudible)
and in terms of the (inaudible).
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
One of the things that Jensen mentioned on Sunday was that unlike prior
generations of your AI and deep learning and HPC-based platforms, Volta was the
ﬁrst platform to be adopted by all of the cloud -- all of the major cloud service
providers in the world. And back in May, again at the Analyst Day, you showed your -
- the head of your data center business showed a pie chart, right, by customers in
terms of enterprise, HPC, cloud service provider, where in terms of number ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-09

Page 8 of 11A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Harlan Sur
A - Colette M. Kresscustomers, CSPs were the smallest percentage. But my sense is that as it relates to
the overall revenue contribution, they're much higher than that. And so I'm just
wondering if you can give us some rough quantiﬁcation of your data center
revenues by customer type.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So think about our customers -- sometimes our customers wear multiple hats,
okay? So when you think about the overall CSPs, in some cases, they are using it for
their overall internal applications. Sometimes they're using it for their overall internal
research or the research organizations. But sometimes they move to become
partners for us in terms of being that conduit in terms of reaching in terms of the
enterprises, reaching -- meeting small businesses, start-ups as well as also in terms of
higher education, in terms of (that), meaning they put it in terms of the cloud. They're
not the end user of it. But they are overall (establishing that) they're using for other
customers. So to talk about them in only one case that says that they are the
customer, yes, in some cases, they are. But a lot of times there in terms of the cloud,
which is a massive amount of additional customers moving forward. Our business
has been broken out between 5 diﬀerent pieces in the data center. One, starting
with the overall training and (inaudible); two, our overall emerging area of
inferencing; number three, our focus in terms of the cloud and creating (hot)
instances for many of these same areas; four, in terms of what we are doing with
high-performance computing; and then ﬁfth, what we see in terms of in the edge, in
terms of creating data center and the overall AI capabilities in terms of the edge. All
of those are extremely important pieces. But yes, the majority of our business does
still stand from our overall training, our overall high-performance computing and our
overall cloud. So those 3 things still make up the overall majority. But you'll hear us
talk about the emerging areas because we do think they're very important, very
important in terms of the overall market size that they represent as well as the overall
shift and transformation that we've seen at these (inaudible) GPUs really end to end
with the (overall AI).
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Let's turn to automotive. The business has grown at a 70% CAGR over the past three
years, grew 52% in calendar '16, most of it on the heels of your infotainment
leadership, right, with the Tegra platform. It's going to decelerate to kind of mid-
teens-type growth calendar year '17. Does the deceleration imply that the Tegra
pipeline is starting to mature? And where are you in terms of the infotainment
design win pipeline? Do you expect that maybe there is some -- going to be some
(win) acceleration? And when do we start to see the ﬁrst big wins on your DRIVE PX
platforms really start to take that growth curve up substantially?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. When you think about overall -- of the last three years in terms of our
automotive business, it has been the lion's share of that has been the overall
infotainment systems. Infotainment systems have been a great addition to the overall
automotive industry. But it's reached a point in terms of its maturity. Most of the cars
-- all of the major car companies all are providing infotainment systems, even in
terms of their mainstream types of cars. Now when you think about the infotainmentFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 11Q - Harlan Sur
A - Colette M. Kresssystems that we concentrate on, the visual computer is a very key part of what we put
together. And we will concentrate in terms of those premium types of areas.
Meaning going in terms of all of the mainstream is probably not the area. But we will
overall shift to incorporate the overall AI in terms of those infotainment systems as
we move forward. So rather a mature area right now, a mature area that we'll
probably see infotainment systems match in terms of the overall automotive
(breadth). Historically, it's moving faster than the automotive because of this being
introduced in terms of (inaudible). So as we move forward, the key partnerships that
we've talked about both here at CES and at prior CESes and throughout the year in
terms of our GDCs are important leading indicators in terms of what we'll see
partnering moving forward. Those partnerships moving to both a possibility in terms
of development agreements as we work jointly in terms of our AI platform inside of
the car. Those are the key things that we see moving forward. Now the timing for
those is still to be seen as working on building these AI cars take several years. They
have -- they do ﬁnd the overall importance of this market and in terms of the
transformation on what they're seeing. But I think -- still think we're a couple of years
away in terms of those production cars being a material part of our overall
automotive business.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Let's talk about crypto and blockchain. Cryptocurrency, mining, blockchain has
emerged. It's small. I think I estimated about 3% to 5% of overall revenues but
potentially increasing part of the revenue opportunity for the NVIDIA team. The
underlying blockchain technology has many uses as a general transactional
technology. Obviously, the underlying computational complexity is what lends itself
to the usage of GPUs. And as the usage of blockchain expands, has the team tried to
quantify the market opportunity? And similar to new market opportunities, what is
the team doing to build an NVIDIA ecosystem to support crypto and new blockchain
platforms?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. Answering cryptocurrency, we get a lot of (little) questions here and there about
the overall market for cryptocurrency and/or in terms of blockchain. It's an
interesting rising area type of interest. A lot of that has just been fueled by the
overall valuations that we've seen. But it's a very hard market because it has market
dynamics. We see a need. But it's not exactly overly clear in terms of where this
overall market will long-term exist. What we do see is there is a demand. There is a
demand where you see sometimes other -- they bring that currency. And therefore,
there will probably still be an underlying pull. But it may have its ebbs and ﬂows
along the way, some of that tied to the overall valuations and what they can receive
in terms of return on investment. We will continue to be able to produce GPUs that
are well suited for this market. Again, we have the ability to produce so many
diﬀerent types of GPUs. It's very easy for us to again be able to support this overall
market, as we have done (somewhat) today. Now are we at the stage, though, that
we would say, "Let's move and create this large investment?" One, I don't think we
need to, as our ability to support -- it is quite easy for us to do. But two, it still has
market dynamics but not necessarily a (full payout) that we could see going forward.
Right now, the current currencies support the use of GPUs. As you recall, going back
to 2014, some of those currencies moved quite quickly in terms of (inaudible). We'llFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-09

Q - Harlan Sursee. There will likely be a new currency. Not sure when. But it's probably a good
outlook to assume that something also will evolve and we'll have to look in terms of
its use in the (inaudible) for that.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Great. Then my last question, with the passage of the tax reform bill, how does this
impact the team's long-term eﬀective tax rate? And how motivated is NVIDIA to take
advantage of the repatriation beneﬁts?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So I'm sure NVIDIA is not alone with many of the ﬁrms that have been working quite
(ridiculously) over the holidays as well as also in terms of the (inaudible). We actually
learned that corporate tax rate will be front and center, I think, quite quickly. So we
are moving to incorporate this in. And the tax teams across the world are working
very fast and furious. But what we see in terms of this is, overall, the overall goal of
tax reform was to lower the overall U.S. rate, lower the U.S. rate because the U.S. rate
is probably some of the highest in the world and deﬁnitely accomplish that. And
that's something that will most likely be neutral as well as positive to us in terms of
our overall tax rates moving forward. It does give us an ability now to not think about
our overall cash and proﬁts that we've received since this is U.S. cash and U.S. proﬁt
and that is overseas U.S. cash and proﬁt. So I think it allows a better use in terms of
that capital, in terms of possibilities, in terms of how we use that. But that doesn't
necessarily change our overall top priorities in terms of our use of cash. Investment
in terms of the business is still our #1 goal that we have. We have extremely large
markets that we are focused on. And we have to make sure that our investment is
rightsized for many of the competitive people that we work with as well. Number
two, we'll look in terms of any types of tuck-ins and things that we can do in terms of
(our) M&A. Nothing historically has been very large for us. But we will continue to
work in terms of that. Our capital return program is still a big focus of ours. It's not a
1-year phenomenon. And we will continue to support that in terms of going forward.
So our uses of capital are still intact and still important. But I think it allows the ease
of use of many companies around the world to not have (inaudible) cash with the
overall tax reform.
