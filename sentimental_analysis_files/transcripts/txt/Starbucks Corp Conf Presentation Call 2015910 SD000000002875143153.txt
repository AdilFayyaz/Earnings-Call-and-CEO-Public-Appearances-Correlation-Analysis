Afternoon, everybody. We're going to go ahead and kick things oﬀ. So we are
delighted to have Scott Maw, the CFO of Starbucks. And head of IR, JoAnn
DeGrande with us this afternoon. This is a company that largely needs no
introduction. A 22,000-unit retailer with industry-leading technology integration, one
of the strongest brands in the world. And perhaps most impressively, a clear path to
growing its $20 billion in sales in the low double digits for the next several years.
That's growth that comes not only from continued food, beverage and technology
innovation. But outside growth in markets like China and new consumer products
verticals.
I'll turn it over to Scott for some prepared remarks. And then we'll move into Q&A
from there.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Karen. I'll keep my prepared remarks relatively short. I just want to
save most of our time for Q&A. But I thought, given the fact that we're wrapping up
our ﬁscal year this month and starting 2016, maybe I'd talk to you just a little bit
about kind of the Starbucks growth agenda and how I see that playing out currently
in the business. And maybe a little bit about how it will play out in 2016.
And maybe the best place to start on that journey is about a year ago, where in the
Fourth Quarter we had 1% transaction comps in the Company, which was a level that
we wanted to improve upon, obviously. And I think there was a fair bit of concern
and skepticism, understandably, in the investment community about our ability to
turn that trend.
What we knew and what we could see inside of the Company was really an
unprecedented level of opportunity around innovation, around investments in digitalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-10
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 2 of 17technology, around investments of technology in our store, what we call partner
digital technology. So technology that enables our partners to move more eﬃciently
and better serve our customers. We knew we had a holiday lineup that was unlike
any other we've ever had. And we knew broadly that as we accelerated those
investments, that comps would turn.
And I think a lot of companies in that situation would have probably moved back
from investment. But what we did is we leaned in. We talked in the latest earnings
call, we put about $140 million of investment into the US P&L. And when you look at
the holiday results, we did turn those comps. We had 2 points of transaction comps
and strong overall comp growth.
And that was a result of the holiday lineup. We had some of the seasonal oﬀerings.
That was a result of some of the marketing investment we had around an ability to
win for sweepstakes, My Starbucks for Life. And that was around a whole bunch of
things we did on one-to-one marketing and digital and MSR that landed very well.
Then as we rolled in to the calendar year in January, we started those partner and
partner digital investments. That included a broad-based change in wage across our
US business. But also pretty heavy investment on the beneﬁt side. So a food beneﬁt
on shift. Not only give our partners a food opportunity. But also to reinforce what's
the fastest growing category within Starbucks is food.
Also we invested pretty heavily in our college achievement plan. So we moved it
from two years of coverage and tuition reimbursement to four years. And we've seen
enrollment tick up signiﬁcantly. And new partners are coming to Starbucks and
staying at Starbucks longer as a result of that program.
Then we did some other things including, I would highlight on the technology in the
stores, we've moved from paper inventory, where we were literally asking our
partners to sort of tick and tie on a checklist inventory, to scanner technology. And
we're rolling that out in the stores. We've improved the WIFI, which beneﬁts our
customers but also increases the bandwidth that our partners can access to do many
of the things that we do. And increased the speed of systems like our point of sale
system in our stores, generally.
And I think the most important thing about all of those investments is that they're
working. And so when you look at comp growth in the last two quarters, particularly
the most recent quarter, we hit 8 points of comp growth in the US with 4 points of
transaction. It is absolutely completely tied to those investments. It's tied to some of
the other things. And I'm sure we'll talk about that in Q&A that we're doing on the
product and digital side. But we know those partner investments are paying oﬀ. So
we'll continue to invest in those.
We'll continue to accelerate investment where we have a winner and we know what's
working. We won't hesitate to lean in. And just to give you one example of that, I'll
use Mobile Order & Pay as an example of that. So when we announced MobileFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-10
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 17Order & Pay. And we rolled Portland in December, we let you know that we would
ﬁnish the rollout of all 7,500 or so company-owned stores in the US by the end of the
calendar year, 2015. Then we saw how well Portland did. We rolled Seattle and the
rest of the Paciﬁc Northwest. That did even better on all of the metrics. And so at that
time, we told you we wanted to get the company-owned stores rolled out by holiday.
Then in June, the middle of June we rolled out about 4,000 stores across the
country, across the Sunbelt and Midwest. And those stores, once again, did better
than Seattle which was doing better than Portland. And what I'll tell you today is
we're accelerating the Mobile Order & Pay rollout. We'll have all company-owned
stores rolled out by the end of this month, including right here in New York. So very
soon you'll be able to call up a menu and place an order from a conference, right at
the end of my very interesting and exciting comments. And then swing down and
pick it up. So that's really important. And we've leaned in on that investment. We
spent the money and taken the cost to do that because we know we have a winner
and it's running ahead of our expectations.
That also sets us up very well for delivery. And so as we think about leaning in on
delivery and getting into our next ﬁscal year, we can talk about it in Q&A. But two
types of delivery, one is a Starbucks partner with delivery. And one is a partnership
that we have with Postmates in Seattle.
The other thing that I'll announce is we've also been working just on the iOS
platform. We have a lot of Android customers that are not happy that they can't do
Mobile Order & Pay on Android. So we'll roll Android as well this month. We had
been talking about holiday. But for Android users, you'll be able to do Mobile Order
& Pay this month as well.
Then one of the things that we've been working on is the ability to have a
customized menu based upon the store that you're ordering from nearest to you. So
the way that manifests itself before this month is if you had a Clover store that you
wanted to order a Clover drink from, because it wasn't on the main menu, you
couldn't get access to that Clover store. So we've been working hard on that. And I
think as of now, we actually have those customized menus. So if you want to get a
Clover through Mobile Order & Pay, you can ﬁnally do that. I'm the big Clover
customer. So I'm extremely happy about that.
So I think the good news about all these investments and about the $140 million is
they're paying oﬀ signiﬁcantly both on the top line and on the bottom line. And as
we think about the Fourth Quarter, I can conﬁrm the non-GAAP EPS guidance that
we had of $0.42 to $0.43. That looks solid for the quarter. And as we think about
ﬁscal 2016, the pipeline of innovation, the opportunities to invest, the number of
things on digital. And the momentum we have across MSR and Mobile Order & Pay
and delivery coming, it's never been greater. So we'll continue to invest in 2016,
including on the partner side. And that'll have some impact on where we land within
that 15% to 20% EPS growth range.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-10

Scott MawThe only other thing I want to call out is just to make sure you're all clear on the
impact on revenue on the Japan acquisition next year. So just quickly. If you look at
what we've guided so far this year, what we've talked about so far this year, year to
date, if you take the Japan acquisition out and you kind of normalize revenue growth
for that, we've grown just over 20% in cap. So fantastic results.
As we look forward and we roll in Japan into that next year -- basically for the full
year; we owned it 11 months -- we expect that the cap growth will continue to be
ahead of what the Company will grow and the highest growth rate of any of our
business units. But somewhat below that 20% growth rate on revenue as we move
into next year. So I just want make sure everyone's clear on that, because sometimes
it's hard when you do an acquisition to get the modeling right.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
So we will probably kick it oﬀ with a question that ﬁts right in line with that, which is
there are a number of moving pieces as we look to next year between -- we have a
53rd week, we have investments that could be untapped. We have the roll in of
mobile ordering. Maybe some continued adoption of beneﬁts around education.
How should we think about those moving pieces in the context of the 15% to 20%?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Right. And I think the thing to take into account is the 10% topline growth, mid-single
digit comp growth. And the 15% to 20% EPS growth holds for next year and the
years beyond that.
I think when we get into earnings, the earnings call in a month, we'll be able to give
you a lot of texture on what does margin look like by business unit, what does
revenue growth look like by business unit. We'll be able to unpack a little bit some of
the investments. So I don't want to go too far into that. I'll just kind of reiterate what I
said which is, all of that and the success, importantly the fact that it's working in these
investments, that'll have some impact on where we land within the range.
And that 15% to 20%, just on the 53rd week concept, the 53rd week will be separate
from that. So we'll tell you where we land within the 15% to 20% range. And then
we'll put the 53rd week on top.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
Fantastic. So going back to a topic that's probably been the one I've gotten the most
questions on for the last couple of months, which is mobile ordering. The fourth
wave of the rollout is well underway. At this stage in the rollout, what have we
learned about how customers are using it? Where can it be incremental in terms of
daypart and traﬃc versus check? And beyond that, where there are other
opportunities beyond just a comp beneﬁt in terms of the customer experience?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-10
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 17Karen Holthouse
Scott MawWhat we're seeing around Mobile Order & Pay is we're seeing incrementality
broadly across all of the store types. And we're seeing increased incrementality and
increased overall metrics as we roll diﬀerent waves. So every wave is stronger than
the one before.
And I think that's due to the fact that we're getting a little bit better operationally on
how to execute this. You'll remember that Mobile Order & Pay is fully integrated into
our technology platform, including the fact that the order goes right into the POS
through the same production mechanism and out to the same handoﬀ plane. But as
we've rolled wave after wave, we've gotten a little bit better about how to handle
that customer interaction at the handoﬀ point. So I think that's helping the results.
The other really important thing -- and again, it's intuitive. But it's worth calling out --
is in our busiest stores at peak, if you take the 20% busiest stores that we have, we're
seeing signiﬁcantly more incrementality and signiﬁcantly more transactions from
Mobile Order & Pay. And you would expect that. But sometimes I get the question
around our busiest stores, you can't put anymore labor in those stores. And the fact
of the matter is we can. So we're taking away some of the pinch point at the POS,
we're adding labor as transactions earn that labor behind the bar. And we're moving
more customers through and we're driving incrementality.
On the customer point, it's really important. So as you can imagine, we measure
customer satisfaction across a number of dimensions all the time. But pre-Mobile
Order & Pay, we can measure customer satisfaction in those stores just before it
launches, then we can measure it afterwards. And there is a signiﬁcant uptick due to
Mobile Order & Pay. We can see it.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
Potentially the other part of the comp story, which I've regularly been as, or even
more excited about, which is food. It's growing at twice the rate of the underlying
business, albeit from a smaller base. But from here, where do you think the biggest
opportunities for growth are? Where is really the focus, to the extent that you're
willing to share it, some insight into the product innovation pipeline? Then within
that, how does evenings tie into the vision of food as a piece of Starbucks business?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I think on a dollar basis. And maybe a weighted comp basis, breakfast still remains
the biggest opportunity. But I would say the revenue growth, the percentage of
growth opportunity really ﬁts in the near term with lunch.
So we'll continue to drive innovation and breakfast. We had breakfast sandwiches
grow 30% last quarter. We've been in breakfast sandwiches forever. But we continue
to make new oﬀerings and up-leveled oﬀerings there. And that's landing well.
But if you look at the lunch platform and the afternoon daypart, we see signiﬁcant
opportunity and signiﬁcant traction to grow there. I think we grew the lunch daypartFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-10
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 17Karen Holthouse
Scott Mawroughly 20% last quarter. So that's the fastest growing daypart for us broadly. And
food's a big piece of that.
And as we build the refreshment platform on the drink side. So as we get transaction
on -- traction on tea, we drove a point of comp in tea each quarter for the last three
quarters. Tea is a drink that better attaches food. And so I think our up-leveled
sandwich oﬀerings, some of the things we've done even with afternoon snacks,
better goes with that tea.
And importantly, to your point, what we've built with food is a success on a level of
quality that allows us to build an innovation pipeline. So similar to what we've done
for decades around coﬀee, we now have very good, very high-quality food. We've
got a team that knows how to deliver that within the four walls of Starbucks.
We've got a ton of opportunity, even within the fresh platform, you and I were talking
earlier. So we've seen a nice lift from Bistro Boxes as we've expanded that. Salads, as
we've up-leveled that. Even yogurt parfaits. All the things that we're doing around
both indulgent and better-for-you food choices in the afternoon.
But we still have opportunity to expand the supply chain across the country. So the
coasts are pretty well covered in that fresh platform. But we've got opportunities in
the middle of the country, just to bring the products that we know work well to bear
there. And we're going after that.
So I do think -- I think very much like food the way we think about beverage. Across
all the dayparts, we have a good food platform. We have tremendous momentum.
We've got a team that's all it's working on seasonal oﬀerings and limited time
oﬀerings to try to drive that.
Then evenings, we're just scratching the surface. So we have a diﬀerent food
program in the evenings that include generally shared plates. So things like bacon-
wrapped dates and truﬄe macaroni. Customers come in generally in small groups.
The ticket is larger. Some may have an espresso beverage, some may have beer or
wine. And then they share a couple of food items. So that's really just getting started.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
And perhaps one other quick topic that's been pretty topical of late, which is the
volatility in China and macro risks. When you look at your business there, how
resilient do you think it is to any sort of macro shocks? And just underlying that, what
is the state of the business? How is the business been changing and evolving since
Starbucks even a few years ago?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
If you look at comps in cap year to date, the last two quarters in particular we've
driven double-digit comps in cap. And we've had double-digit transactions withinFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-10
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 17Karen Holthouse
Scott Mawthat. So it's really a transaction story.
And importantly, China is actually comping higher than the big numbers we've been
putting up in cap. So I think that speaks to the health of the brand in China. We've
talked quite a bit about the proﬁtability of the China stores. They're increasing each
year. We're seeing those stores come out of the ground at the highest AUVs that
we've ever had as we open stores. So the traction we have in China is signiﬁcant.
And we typically don't give intra-quarter guidance. But I'll just give you a little
update on China, given the fact it's on everyone's mind. What I'll say is we're not
seeing any material impact on transactions in China from all the uncertainty around
the stock market and currency and the consumer. We're not seeing -- and this is year
to date through August -- we're not seeing any material impact on proﬁtability or on
revenue. So I think the health of the brand is guiding us well through some of this
uncertainty. The number of transactions that we're seeing is good.
I probably should just remind everyone that the Fourth Quarter does have some
seasonality from the mid-autumn holiday. And we'll see some of that. And ticket that
comes and goes and it's transitional. But at least so far, I think Q4 is going to stack up
really well once again in China.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
Fantastic. So one of the things that has been a huge part of the story for the last
couple of years is the development of My Starbucks Rewards, which is really an
industry-leading rewards program, not just in restaurants. But across a much broader
group of consumer companies. And not only just the rewards program. But all of the
opportunities it creates around one-to-one marketing and better sort of harnessing
that data that you have. And beyond that, partnerships with new people where
you're tying them in to sort of selling rewards they can then give to customers. What
other opportunities are there? What inning of the game are we at in those things?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I think it's early innings, particularly around the analytics we have on one-to-one
marketing and around the partnerships we're driving. My Starbucks Reward has
been around for a while and it's been successful for a while. We have 30% of our
transactions that are on My Starbucks Rewards related. So I think we have
tremendous momentum there. The real opportunity is how do we get to the next
stage.
And so if you look at the one-to-one marketing, the improvements that we've driven
really under Matt Ryan's leadership since he's come in from Disney over the last
couple of years. And harnessing the data, being much quicker and much more
segmented and speciﬁc in how we market to diﬀerent groups of customers. Much
quicker in integrating the feedback we get from those marketing eﬀorts. Updating
and tweaking the analytics, and then making a new oﬀer. All of that is signiﬁcantly
better than it was a couple of years ago.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-10
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 17Karen Holthouse
Scott MawBut I would say we're in the early innings. Maybe second inning there. We still have a
lot of opportunity. We've invested in people in that space. We're investing more in
technology as we get into 2016 to try to automate those processes. And I would say
the improvement that we saw, for example in holiday, a decent amount was due to
more --sharper one-to-one marketing capabilities.
Then the partnerships we've been -- you and I were joking earlier -- we've been
talking about these digital partnerships and the kinds of discussions we've been
having for two years. And we've been having real and meaningful discussions. But
there's a lot at stake. And I think both sides want to make sure we get it right. So I
think we're really happy to announce the partnerships with Spotify, Lyft, and the New
York Times. They're fantastic companies.
We think the agreements will drive signiﬁcant beneﬁts for both sides. They're buying
stars from us. They're going to use those stars to drive a subscription. That'll bring
more customers back in to our stores. It gives some of our customers access to
content and premium content through Spotify and New York Times that they
wouldn't have before.
I would argue that Mobile Order & Pay. And ultimately delivery, is a great extension
of My Starbucks Rewards. And will drive increased acquisition and retention as we
add more and more beneﬁts. And so My Starbucks Rewards is really moving beyond
the earn free drink, which is a fantastic beneﬁt for customers, and adding more and
more functionality and capability, and that should drive up membership.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
Moving a little bit beyond the top line to one of those other lines on the P&L. This
year there's a signiﬁcant investment, which you referenced earlier, in these employee
beneﬁts. A combination of wages and then the education beneﬁt. As we look to next
year, wages are topic of conversation really across consumer and retail. Do you think
that that sort of level of investment needs to continue? Are there assets of that that
ramp over time? Or is that sort of a one-time, you've leapt out ahead and now can
grow into that for a couple of years?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I think I would say we've always been ahead. And so what we did this year was to
ensure that we continue to maintain and extend that diﬀerentiation we have, not only
in wage. But I think importantly in the overall beneﬁt package. The thing we've done
with healthcare, the things we've done with bean stock. And so we loved adding the
food beneﬁt. We think that's completely consistent with what we've been about.
We love adding the college achievement plan. The fact that enrollment in that is
ramping signiﬁcantly, that will add cost. But we also think beneﬁt, we've not only
seen comps up. But turnover is down. So already, as we've made those investments,
typically it takes a while for those to sort of work through the system and driveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-10

Karen Holthouseincreased employee retention, partner retention. But we're already seeing that in the
numbers.
And so as we look to next year, not only what we have -- the continued success and
tailwind. And the number of people that are signing up for college achievement
plan, the number of people that are using the food beneﬁt -- but we'll probably have
some new things that we do on wage and beneﬁt as well. And I think that'll be the
case for, maybe forever.
Oh, right. JoAnn just reminded me on something important. There's also some math
in that, Karen. So we really started ramping the partner investments in January of last
year. So we'll have, in the First Quarter we'll have that lapping impact of everything.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
Well and then one of the other parts of cost on the P&L is, last September, the
Analyst Day, there is pretty ambitious plan for $1 billion in cost savings over the next
ﬁve years rolled out. Where do we stand in that plan? What's sort of the cadence of
progress from here?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
We're almost exactly 25% of the way through, which is good because we're one year
into the four-year plan. So this year, we have line of sight to over $200 million in cost
of goods savings. And the big work streams that we talked about at the Analyst Day
is really up-leveling and being much sharper and more speciﬁc around sourcing
opportunities. We deﬁnitely had signiﬁcant savings as we rolled out the La Boulange
food oﬀering. We up-leveled the quality. We simpliﬁed the recipe. We moved to a
frozen supply chain. And we lowered the cost for our suppliers and we shared in that
beneﬁt.
We're seeing signiﬁcant traction broadly across the supply chain in areas like
transportation, manufacturing, warehousing. And all of those are driving signiﬁcant
savings as head into next year. So I think next year will be over $200 million as well.
We also see savings in waste in the store. So we had speciﬁc focus on food waste.
But also coﬀee and dairy waste. And we're getting traction in that in Cliﬀ Boro's [ph]
Americas business and beyond.
And so we've got line of sight already to, I want to call maybe 80% of that $200
million as we head into next year. Then I think as we enter into 2017, it'll be even
more.

Questions And Answers
Hi, thank you. I appreciate your comments about labor costs before and the beneﬁts.
I'm trying to sort of absorb this $15 or minimum they're talking about in New York
State. Presumably, if that's the starting wage and other people would have to -- that
might be getting less than $15 an hour would have to get more. So more than just
the impact on your minimum wage employees, I presume. So how do you deal with
that, is essentially my question. Does it destroy your -- does it hurt your economics in
the store? Are there other oﬀsets? How do you do that?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I won't comment speciﬁcally on the minimum wages. But what I will say is we've
been broadly supportive about increasing pay and beneﬁts for our employees. And I
think that's been true for all time with Starbucks. But I think this year we put about
$140 million behind that.
And so we're out in front of a lot of those investments. We'll continue to be out in
front of that. And for us, we look at it as an investment, because if you look at what's
happened with our transaction comps. And you look at what's happened with our
turnover, those investments pay back. There's obviously a balancing factor in all of
that. But we're broadly supportive of investing more. And you'll see more in 2016.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
Is there anybody else? Having a little bit of trouble seeing into the light.
I'm holding the microphone way back here. So I had a question about just your food
initiative and the ovens you have. Have you thought about shifting in some of your
higher sandwich stores to more than one oven? I think right now, if I go in and place
an order for like four croissants. And someone else places like a croissant, the person
behind me croissant, I have to wait until their two croissants are done before they'll
toast all four of mine.
By the way, I mean it's kind of a silly question. But my point is, have you reached a
point -- true story -- but have you reached a point where you may put in more than
one oven into a store? And have you thought about doing that across all stores, if
you're really going to truly switch to being not just beverages?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
So I would say broadly we've accelerated deployment of second ovens across our
store base. That doesn't mean that they're in every store. But we've been addingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-10
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 11 of 17Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Scott Maw
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantmore second ovens. We're opening more stores that have two ovens. Some of them
occasionally are dedicated to the drive-thru. So I think the short answer to your
question is, yes, we have analytics to understand when to add a second oven. And
where we have the space, we do.
Could you give us some color as to food attach rates in your Mobile Order & Pay
versus just regular customers walking in? Is it signiﬁcantly higher or moderately
higher or no diﬀerence?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
What I'll broadly talk about is ticket, which obviously reﬂects attach. And Mobile
Order & Pay ticket is about equal to the average MSR ticket across our entire store
base. So what we're seeing early days here is transaction incrementality and ticket
about even with the average transaction across Starbucks.
What we believe is as we develop the capability -- and I don't know if you've used
Mobile Order & Pay yet -- but you basically build an order. And as you're building
that order, there are windows where you see pictures of product and other things.
And we're currently planning on rolling out later in 2016 the ability to basically have
suggested selling as you're building that order to suggest food items.
So if it's in the early afternoon and you're ordering an iced tea, we might picture a
panini. Eventually we'll be able to understand your purchase and attach behavior.
And if in the morning you always attach a reduced fat turkey bacon sandwich to a
brewed coﬀee. And you're building an order with a brewed coﬀee and you haven't
attached yet, we might be able to slide in a picture of that tasty reduced fat turkey
bacon sandwich.
So that's kind of what we're building. And we're conﬁdent that that will drive some
lift in ticket. And the reason we believe that is as we rolled out drive-thru, I think there
was a lot of concern broadly that we wouldn't have the attach that we have in the
stores because you don't have the case right there in front of you. And what we've
seen in drive-thru, particularly as we've improved and broadened the imagery at the
order point, we've seen attach pick up. So I think we'll see that in mobile order as
well.
Quick question. I have little visibility on your food proposition. As a client, I have to
tell you, I love Starbucks. I hate eating at Starbucks being 100% frank with you.
Can you give us some visibility? Say who is best in class for you in that? How big is
the gap that you see? How big are the opportunities since player X makes X million
per store in terms of food sales. And at same time we're still lagging behind. Is there
a benchmark that you can aim for? Is there anyone that you believe that's doing an
excellent job that you should be going that direction? Can you give us some visibility
on the size of the opportunity there?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-10

So just make sure I understood the question. It's around food sales in our stores and
how we can make it bigger and better?
Exactly. Just give an example. I got in mind that, I know that say someone like
McDonald's makes $2 million in a store of food sales. Someone like Burger King
does whatever, $1 million. And Wendy's does $1.4 million. So that sort of benchmark I
have in my mind. So I know the size of the gap that's in Burger King and McDonald's.
So can you give us some visibility of who's your benchmark and how far away you
may see yourself from that food-wise?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I think the ﬁrst thing I would say is you're never going to see food be 50% or 60% of
our sales in Starbucks. You know what our base, we're a high-quality coﬀee company.
Increasingly, we're a beverage company that oﬀers juice and tea and a broad
selection of beverages across the entire daypart. And so beverage will always be the
majority of what we do. And we're ﬁne with that. We have good proﬁtability in
beverage, it drives traﬃc. And it gives us the opportunity for attach.
With that said, we've tried -- we've been trying to up-level our food oﬀering for a
number of years. And I think with the La Boulange acquisition, we've done that. So I
think our food's gone from maybe okay to quite good. That's the customer feedback
that we get. La Boulange was a big part of that. And we continue to expand and
build oﬀ that.
As far as the sales opportunity, we've grown food as a percentage of total revenue in
the US business from kind of the mid-teens range to about 20% over the last three
or four years. So we have traction. Our customers are telling us with their wallet that
they like our food.
I think over the next ﬁve years, we think we can grow that another 5 points, which will
roughly double the revenue from food over that time period. So we know, getting
from 20% to 25%, we have to do a lot of things right. I think that was Karen's
question. We have to capture dayparts correctly. But if you look at the last couple of
years, we've been driving 2 points of food comp pretty much every quarter. We're
getting a broad-based food oﬀering across the entire daypart. And we're quite
happy with what we're seeing.
Hi. Could you please talk about your tea segment? What progress you're making
with Teavana? Whether you've shifted from Tazo's tea to Teavana in what amount of
Starbucks stores? And just the overall plans for growth in that segment?

A - Scott MawSo Teavana in our Starbucks stores?
Yes.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
What I mentioned I think in my opening comments, or if I didn't, I'll mention now,
we've had about 1 point of comp growth from tea over the past few quarters. And
tea's been a meaningful part of our business for years. It's been in that 8% or 9% of
total revenue range. But frankly, given the adjacency of tea to coﬀee, while 8% or 9%,
it's about $1 billion business, or was about a $1 billion business in our US stores. I
think 8% or 9%, we'd all agree we can do better than that.
So I think with Teavana what we bought, much like I was talking about with La
Boulange. And we feel about Starbucks with coﬀee, we believe we have a platform
and a brand where we can drive signiﬁcant tea growth across the daypart. So that's
hot tea, that's iced tea in the afternoon. And we've seen that in recent quarters. And
particularly in some of the limited time oﬀerings we have. So right now we have a
mango black tea lemonade that's out there that's doing extremely well. And again, it
gives us the ability, the team has the ability to introduce great recipes. And we've
executed that very well in the stores.
Has there been much of a shift from 2014 to 2015 within tea?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes.
In terms of product oﬀerings?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Maybe not so much in terms of the product oﬀering, although we do have more.
And I would argue better, seasonal oﬀerings. But what I would say is the traction that
we're getting with the Teavana brand is signiﬁcant. So in 2014, we did not drive a
signiﬁcant amount of comps in tea. It wasn't a full point. But so far in 2015, it's
contributing a full point to comp. And it's got tremendous momentum as we head
through the summer here.
And again, I'll go back. There's kind of a common theme here. Starbucks gives us the
capabilities, the recipe design. And the innovation and coﬀee. And we continue to
build on that. Then we brought Evolution Fresh and we've done that around juice.
And we've seen a signiﬁcant uptick in proﬁtability for juice in our stores. Given the
high quality we have with Evolution Fresh, we're doing some things around yogurt
parfaits in that space.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-10

A - Scott MawThen we moved to La Boulange. And we do it with food. And we build out that
platform and we innovate. And Teavana's doing the exact same thing with tea.
I think you have alcohol in roughly 75 locations now. Just curious if you could discuss
what your evening activation plan might look like over the next three years. And the
food oﬀering in conjunction with the alcohol oﬀering. Thanks.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Sorry, the acoustics aren't great up here. So sorry. Yes. We have increased our
evenings program. What we started with really over the last couple years is about 30
stores where we've been testing and trying to understand what we need to do with
evenings, both from an oﬀering standpoint, as well as an ambient standpoint. And
what's the right level of investment. We learned a lot over that time period. And
based upon the success that we had in those stores, we'll be ramping evenings.
So we'll add, as we move into 2016, hundreds of evenings locations. We're actively
working on licensing and all the things that we have to do there. But we believe
there's a real daypart opportunity for us.
And it's not just about beer and wine. It's really about a broader ticket opportunity
where people generally come in in small groups. Someone might order a decaf
espresso. Someone might order tea. Someone might order beer or wine. And they
might share a couple of small plates of food, as I said earlier. So it's early days. But I
think we're quite encouraged by what we can drive there.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
I'll go ahead and -- looks like there's not anything in the audience right now. So I'll
hop in with one. And I think this really ties together a lot of the questions which
we've gotten this afternoon, which is you look at this mid-single digit comp guidance
over the next four years. How do we think of that as a build? What are the diﬀerent
pieces that get you sort of comfortably to mid-single digit guidance? And is there a
little bit of a cushion or a margin of error built into that?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
If you look over the last two or three years, I think as we look forward in the near
term, the mid-single digit comp build up is similar to what we've delivered. Now we
have to have diﬀerent things that drive that every year, because we've got to build
on where we ended. So food will probably be in that 2 points of comp growth. And if
we want food to get to that 25% of total revenue, we need 2 points of comp. So I
would look for that.
We've generally had a point, sometimes two. But around a point for beverage
innovation. So this includes seasonal oﬀerings like pumpkin spice latte. This includes
things that we do around holiday. Things that we do around the refreshment
platform. And we typically look for a point of comp in that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-10
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 15 of 17A - Karen Holthouse
A - Scott MawThen we'll look for perhaps another point of comp in tea. We'll have to see how that
all plays out. But that could build as a platform for us.
Then the rest of the mid-single digit comp that comes from what we kind of call the
core platform. So that includes espresso, with things like Flat White. That includes
Frappuccino, which we continue to comp every year. And so that's been 1, 2, or 3
points, depending on the quarter, pretty much every quarter. So I think that's how it
builds going forward.
What's underneath that, which I think is driving the acceleration we've seen recently
as the investments we're making around MSR, how much sharper we are with
marketing there. The things we're doing on partner investments, some things we've
done on labor and staﬃng in the store, which has helped at peak. And all of that
underlies and helps deliver those category base comps.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
Again, if there's a question in the audience. So I'll continue. When we're thinking
about topline growth, pretty much all the questions today really centered on what's
the opportunity to grow comparable store sales and ignores the opportunity to grow
units. There's one express store that's been open in New York. What have you
learned in terms of potential of that unit to address some unique real estate
locations in the US or internationally? And what has it told you about just unmet
demand in terms of peak capacity demand versus what you can do in the existing
store footprint?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
It's one store in its early days. But the level of transactions that we're seeing in a store
that's got about 500 square feet. So it's about the third of the size that we have for
our average store in Starbucks. We're seeing transactions that are comparable with
stores that are much larger. And comparable to kind of the average of the portfolio.
There's a store just across the street from that store at 14 Wall. And there's been no
cannibalization on that store. So we are picking up incremental traﬃc.
We reduced the menu a little bit to streamline things for the store. And as we look
forward, we think we'll have a lot of opportunities to open what we call express
stores in urban markets, not only in the US and large cities. But perhaps
internationally.
And I think the nature of your question is important because occasionally I get asked,
are you at saturation from your unit growth in the US? And I think the ﬂexibility that
we've had in store formats gives us a lot of conﬁdence to continue to grow at that
4%, 5%, or 6% portfolio growth rate we've been growing at over the last few years.
And that includes drive-thrus, which we've been accelerating over the last few years
and are doing extraordinary drive-thru-only stores, express stores. We'll start to open
Reserve, Starbucks Reserve stores which will have generally a larger footprint, more
brewed coﬀee oﬀerings where you might be able to order a Clover, a pour-over, or aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-10

And so that gives us more conﬁdence to go into a diﬀerent type of geography. And
so all of those things, again, they're working. And it gives us a strong belief that
there's lots of opportunity and traﬃc for us to capture.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
Well then going back to my -- or mobile ordering for another time, as we're looking
at this and thinking through 2016, 2017, what's the rollout look like? Not just in terms
of the units. But in terms of capabilities? And how do we think of that adding to
comps as a one-time lift or something? Does this build over time? Does it turn into
My Starbucks Rewards all over again where it's a tailwind to over a multiyear period?
When you're talking about Mobile Order & Pay.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. I think what we'll see and what we're seeing in the early days is we'll see a build
of the adoption curve. And frankly, I kind of like that because it builds comp over a
period that I think will be multiple years.
So it happens when we launch Mobile Order & Pay is we're working to build
awareness. And the ﬁrst group that we'll build awareness with is My Starbucks
Reward members, particularly those that use the mobile app. But there will be a
natural adoption curve as people become more aware, as they try it, like it. And try it
more frequently.
The good news is that adoption curve is running above what we had in the business
plan. And it's higher in each market as we've rolled the waves. And I think as we roll
New York over the next few weeks, it'll be higher once again, just given the density
of stores in those markets.
So I think it's a way to achieve mid-single digit comps for what we think will be a
number of years.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
I have just a few minutes left. So as a ﬁnal wrap-up question, it's hard to imagine that
there is really a part of the story that people aren't excited about right now. But if
there was a piece of it that you think is maybe misunderstood or people are missing
the opportunity, what would it be?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I think we always have to remind people that mid-single digit comps and double-
digit revenue growth for a company that has $20 billion in revenue. And tries to
grow at 10% a year on the top line and 15% to 20% a year on the bottom line at a $5
transaction, we need a number of things going on. And we'll always have a number
of investments so that we can rebuild that mid-single digit comp. I think we get aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-10

focus and execution to grow a $20 billion company across all of our geographies.
