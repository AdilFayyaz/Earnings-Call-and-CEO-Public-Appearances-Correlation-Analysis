{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Good morning, everybody. Welcome to Deutsche Bank's 16th Annual Tech
Conference. I'm Brad Zelnick, Head of Software Equity Research, and I'm delighted
to be joined by none other than Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud for our
morning keynote. Thomas, welcome and thanks for being here.
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
Thank you for having me Brad, it's great to be here.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Awesome. So the format of this session will be a ﬁreside chat. But before we begin,
I'd like to read the following Safe Harbor on behalf of the Alphabet. Some of the
statements that Thomas Kurian will make today may be considered forward-looking.
These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to diﬀer materially. Any forward-looking statements that Thomas Kurian makes
are based on assumptions as of today. And Alphabet undertakes no obligation to
update them. Please refer to Alphabet's Form 10-K and the most recent Form 10-Q
for discussion of the risk factors that may aﬀect its results.
And just to jump right in, while I imagine most are familiar with Thomas's
background. Just a very brief bio for those that might be less familiar. Thomas joined
Google in November, 2018 as the CEO of Google Cloud. Prior to Google, Thomas
spent 22 years at Oracle Corporation, where most recently he was President of
Product Development. Thomas's degrees include an MBA from Stanford University
and BSW in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Princeton University.
And with that, why don't we dive right into the fun. Is that okay, Thomas?

Questions And Answers
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
(Question And Answer)
Excellent. So maybe the ﬁrst question I had for you. Can you talk about the
pandemic and the way that it's changed the technology requirements for
businesses? And as well, how it's changed the market opportunity for Google
Cloud?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
The pandemic has hugely accelerated digitization in every industry, and each
industry looks at it as in diﬀerent lens, retailers look at it as e-commerce, medical
providers look at it as telehealth, but the changes are really pervasive, and the ﬁrst
phase of COVID happened, everybody wanted to move to a digital front door. So,
we help organizations like Loblaws, for example, to create ecommerce system to
help bring traﬃc and be able to fulﬁll demand. But then as you saw that rush of
demand, you saw people not comfortable and wanting to ask questions and get
help. So, we help for example, Albertsons to create a complete virtual assistant to
help their people and consumers, then they were lots of deeper things that may not
be perceptible, but supply chains were hugely disrupted. And for example, making
sure that the right medicine could get to the right place to get vaccinations for
example, we have to help organization like, Cardinal and McKesson in the supply
chain space. And then, we are seeing even deeper things happening in longer term,
for example, in the hospital system, a real shift where people used to have to go to
the hospitals to take care. But now whether it's with telemedicine or telehealth, we're
seeing a lot of changes in the way that care will be provided to people.
So, we do expect that the changes that have happened because of COVID in the
technology landscape. Many will persist long after, because they are fundamental
shifts in the way technology is being used. And secondly, there is also recognition in
many organizations that they were not prepared for some of the disruption, whether
it's in their manufacturing systems, supply chain distribution networks that COVID
introduced.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
It's helpful. I feel almost as if the earth's rotational along its axis has been
accelerating over this last year or two. You can almost feel it probably so that is
consistent. Maybe a bigger picture question, I think many are familiar or have a
perception of how GCP positions itself within the marketplace. Could you maybe
speak more broadly about how the oﬀering is diﬀerentiated? And what factors are
driving customer wins for you?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 3 of 12Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Thomas KurianI mean what's really driving is that shift to digitization has introduced ﬁve or six new
requirements in organizations, and we designed our cloud to support these needs.
The ﬁrst one I think when you talk to larger companies now, there's a fundamental
belief that they're going to use technology from multiple cloud players, something
called multi-cloud, and for example TELUS and the networking. They use technology
from many-many companies, but the multi-cloud technology from us is the
foundation for it.
Secondly, data is now particularly with the shift to digital, whether it's understanding
your customer, understanding your infrastructure, for example your network, if
you're a carrier, like the work we're doing with Vodafone as the data platform is
becoming the fuel for organizations.
Third, anytime you put a lot of data into a system, you increasingly read of all kinds
of new cyber-attacks coming in, and there's enormous interest in Google's expertise
in providing both the secure cloud, as well as security tools to protect against
cybersecurity. And so we see that as a big diﬀerentiator. Our history as a secure
technology company now translating into how can we secure companies' systems as
they move to the cloud.
Lastly, every business executive wants to see faster value in their transformation,
whether it's the faster value in how they run their supply chain, how they forecast
demand, how they serve customers. And so, we built a set of industry solutions and
they use -- being used by lots of organizations, LVMH for example in retail, wanted to
change how they interact with their luxury customers and we're helping them with
some of our far industry solutions in retail and so that eﬀort is also been very
important.
Lastly, a new theme we see emerging a lot is the notion as organizations look over a
multi-year timeframe on their sustainability commitments. We're seeing a lot of
interest in the fact that we run a green cloud. We've been carbon-neutral for since
2007, so, 14 years now. And whether it's Unilever or various other organizations, we
see that as a big source of interest in helping them meet their sustainability
objectives as well. So these are some of the big trends we see. We designed our
technology and our solutions to capture these opportunities and likewise we're
seeking so much demand for our products and services.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Thank you for that Thomas. And I'd like to maybe touch on those trends and some of
those factors that you mentioned maybe for starters, the third one. Security and
ultimately trust is so paramount for what you do, we hear about breaches nearly
every single day in the news. How much of security is table stakes for everything that
you might provide versus a discrete opportunity to go after the $100 billion plus
spent every year on cyber defense. Is there a reason customers can feel even more
secure running in Google Cloud versus others?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 12Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Thomas KurianWe are focused, Brad on three important things. One, how to make sure that the way
software is built is secure to avoid things like the SolarWinds attack, which is
cybersecurity attack through a compromise in the software supply chain. Second,
how do we protect people when they run their workloads in Google Cloud, so the
security of Google Cloud? And third, how do we give them tools to understand the
threat posture and protect them no matter where they run their workloads which is a
security for your enterprise. And we have lots of organizations using our platform for
all three of these things, just as a secure cloud infrastructure. One of the big things
we've done is we brought ﬁnancial institutions like BBVA, stock exchanges like the
London Stock Exchange and a variety of others, Equifax for example in the ﬁnancial
markets to run on top of our cloud because of security it provides. One of the very
interesting new oﬀers that we have introduced, which is getting a lot of attention
from customers is every cyber event to some extent is a black swan event. The
organization thinks it's secured, cybersecurity event happens, and then they don't
have a way of measuring their risk posture.
So, what we felt was just like any other risk cybersecurity should be measurable your
posture. It should be measured as a risk that you can manage and our platform in
Google Cloud provides organizations not only the ability to protect themselves but
to measure their posture. And now we oﬀer cyber insurance at two companies
running their technology in our cloud because of the capabilities which we oﬀer. So,
we're getting a lot of interest, particularly as the threats grow and the impacts of the
threats grow.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
It's really important. By the way, I was unaware of the cyber insurance oﬀering. I'm
going to follow up on my own and get smarter on that. I've always felt the last
several years that cyber insurance is a key component of any cyber defense strategy,
but in the respective time and so much to talk about, I'd like to move on to
something that's obviously very core to Google itself. Can you share some examples
of why businesses are choosing Google Cloud for your capabilities in data analytics?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
Data, our capabilities in data analytics are super simple. We want to allow people to
combine structured and unstructured data in real-time as well as large scale
processing, no matter where that data originates from our cloud or other clouds.
And there are many-many examples of people and I'll just use some examples that
you may not be aware of because it's happening inside organization. So, if you use
Gillette for example as a razor, the forecasting of demand for how many razors to
manufacture and how to be more accurate and where you need to distribute them,
that's done on our cloud. If you ordered a package and you want it to track its
delivery, we work super closely with you UPS for example, using our data cloud to
help them optimize how long and how eﬃciently their trucks and their ﬂeet can be
scheduled.
If you look at for example, Best Buy and the e-comm, the electronics -- consumer
electronics business. They want to be much more accurate in understanding their
customers and merchandising products for them. And their whole data platform inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 12Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Thomas Kurianthe retail business runs on our cloud. And then lastly, many-many hospital systems,
when a doctor talks to a patient they need to have a full view of the record of the
patient. All of their history there, what their biomedical factors may be, the genetic
predisposition for certain diseases, and we've helped many organizations use that
data platform to serve people. And example of a project that we're super proud of is
we've done work with a company in Brazil to deliver care, virtual care during COVID
to 30 million people in the Amazon. And in order for them to be able to deliver that
care, they needed a data platform that could pull all of the data together and our
work with Carol T for example, this company has facilitated that. So data permeates
many-many parts of the business in organizations and our capability and our
expertise, and our much -- and our scalable data platform as well as our machine
learning tools are now helping many-many organizations use this capability.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Those are really strong examples. Thank you for that Thomas. And maybe as we
reﬂect on just enterprise cloud adoption more broadly over the last several years.
There were varying perspectives as to whether hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, cloud ﬁrst,
now, I'm hearing the phrase from another vendor out there that talks, one of your
partners actually, that talks about cloud smart. But I think it's clear that multi-cloud is
the future, no one especially medium, large enterprise is settling on just one cloud.
And Google has been very clear that it embraces a multi-cloud approach for its -- for
customers and you tend to talk about multi-cloud more than your peers. Why is this
so important?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
I'll give you a very simple analogy and then talk about it, right? When the Internet
was happening years ago, imagine you had certain web pages that only showed up
in Microsoft brows, and other web pages that only showed up in Netscape browser.
And yet another set of web pages that only showed up in Firefox, you wouldn't have
the Internet. And so from our point of view, cloud is going to be a transformational
infrastructure. People should be able to develop their applications and run them on
any cloud of their choice, but not be locked into the cloud. Secondly, they should be
able to use infrastructure from multiple companies in concert. They can use data
from Google along with other technology from other cloud provider, side by side.
And you should be able to manage multiple clouds, their security and operational
requirements in a much more consistent way. And so, and then, lastly, particularly as
technologies, as 5G come out the need to distribute processing closer to the user
leads to things like edge cloud. And increasingly, we see that carriers for example,
many who we work with want a much more portable infrastructure for edge. So this
notion of an open cloud that allows choice from multiple companies is now helping
us solve real problems.
We've got, for example, J. B. Hunt in the transportation and logistics market. They
wanted to continue to rise and move their applications and have choice in adopting
technology from multiple companies. TELUS in the network operations, they wanted
to use our cloud to transform their network, but they wanted to build their
technology in a much more much more modern way, using modern cloud-native
technology and that allows them to use a much more open architecture. And then
we see for example, you've been reading about some outages that occurred withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 12Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Thomas Kuriansome of the cloud providers in Japan recently. And many companies ask us, can they
run their workloads across multiple cloud providers to provide for example better
resilience and reliability. And our design center has been to facilitate that to make
that possible for people and then let them choose the best cloud provider for their
need.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
That's helpful, Thomas. Thank you very much. That makes a lot of sense and I like
your analogy as we think about the original web browser. Maybe if we could change
topics to talk a little bit about go-to-market. Google, especially since you've landed I
know you have hired some of the most talented enterprise sales reps, direct reps
that I've known along the way. So, you're doing something right for sure. Thomas
you've seen the evolution of enterprise sales ﬁrsthand, evolving from decades ago,
having a steak eating golf-playing salesperson, show up to your doorstep with a
PowerPoint deck to educate the customer. Today, the process is far more digital and
naturally varies by product category and other factors. How should we think about
the evolution of Google Cloud's go-to-market and why it's a strategic diﬀerentiator
for you?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
That's great. I mean we see our go-to-market ﬁrst of all in three or four diﬀerent
lenses. One, we have shifted as an organization from talking about technology and
shifted from technology to products to solutions, and if customers want to have us
understand their business, the opportunity to transform their business and then
provide solutions for their business problems as opposed to coming in and talking
about how great that technology is. So that's been a big change in selling
methodology and approach.
A second thing that we've done is, we've organized our sales organization around
industries because diﬀerent industries have diﬀerent needs. And ﬁnancial services,
for example, the use of data may be for fraud detection, may be for regulatory
reporting, maybe for ﬁnancial market simulation, in contrast in retail it may be about
personalization, inventory management, supply chain optimization, et cetera. So,
we've segmented our sales force by industry, so that we can build greater
competency in understanding customer needs.
Third, to be honest, the last 18 months have been almost all digital in our
engagement with customers because -- just because of the pandemic you're forced
to engage with customers in a digital medium, and we've learned how to do that
really well even as we brought in a lot of new salespeople and grew the
organization. We also got them engaged with customers through digital media and
that's helped to bring a certain degree of eﬃciency in our scaling, the distribution
organization.
And lastly, we would not be where we are without our partners. We have always felt
strongly we're a products and solutions company. We have an ecosystem, and the
ecosystem has helped us scale the business really well and we're working super well
with our partners in a variety of diﬀerent parts of the world. So a lot of this is credit toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 12Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Thomas Kurian
Q - Brad Zelnickthe senior talent that we brought into the sales organization. They know how to sell,
they know how to do relationship selling and that competency, many people ask us
how will you build 20 years or 30 years of selling experience quickly and one, we
brought in some of the best talent to have that experience, but two, we equipped
them with new selling methodology, so that they could use digital tools and digital
ways of seller.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
By the way, I know there's a number of really great people, but I'll give a shout-out to
Rob Enslin, who is just a luminary in the industry, he's phenomenal, so no surprise
with all the success and traction that you're seeing. Maybe if I can double-click on
just two of the points that you've made, Thomas. First on the ecosystem, in the
context of go-to-market, how do you think about the partner ecosystem and getting
leverage there? You've had some important announcements with partners like
Workday recently for example. What's your strategy with partners both in the U.S.
and globally?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
We look at partners in four ways, partners that can complement our solution oﬀering,
partners that can help us deliver jointly new solutions to customers, partners that
bring implementation, change, management expertise, and then, partners that
broaden our distribution reach. I'll just touch on two ﬂavors, partners that
complement our solution portfolio. There are lots of places for instance in security
that we work with organizations not just to oﬀer our security products. But for
example, the people like Palo Alto Networks with Cybereason, with Splunk and
others to oﬀer a more holistic solution to customers. Similarly, in analytics and data
we oﬀer solutions with organizations like, Informatica, with Tableau and others to
oﬀer our customers a more complete solution. With software vendors that build
applications, we work closely with organizations, you mentioned Workday, SAP and
others that work across industries, so we can oﬀer solutions to multiple industries.
But we also have deep partnerships in speciﬁc industries. In telecommunications for
example, we work very closely with Ericsson to deliver joint solutions, Telecom Italia,
is a company where Ericsson and us work together to provide new capability for
their 5G network.
So, there's, a lot of work we're doing. Delivery, helping an organization adopt cloud
is not just a question of putting the solution for them, but making sure those
solutions can be adopted, often that requires change management of people in the
organization as well to adopt the technology and we work very closely with a
number of partners, Accenture, Tata Consulting, Deloitte, Infosys, and each of them
have practices that they have built around our product portfolio, and so that helps us
also bring clients to them jointly and to be able to deliver the promise of cloud to
clients together.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Great. That's very-very clear. So thank you for the comprehensive answer. And just on
the other front, you talked industry verticals and frankly throughout our entire
conversation. You've mentioned many customer examples, much of which is verticalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 8 of 12A - Thomas Kurian
Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Thomas Kurianspeciﬁc in terms of what you're delivering for them. But can you maybe double-click
a bit further about speaking the language of the customer and your vertical market
strategy and why Google is in a strong position to win with industry solutions? And
maybe any again you've already shared so many, but if there's any speciﬁc industry
anecdote or solution to really bring the point home as to why this is so important for
your business strategy?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
So, a lot of our focus with our technology is not just modernizing the IT landscape
within an organization, but also bring our expertise in analytics and data processing
as well as machine learning and AI. To service the needs of the business that are
outside of traditional IT. So, I'll just give you and what we're doing is taking our
expertise in machine learning and AI and then applying it to speciﬁc problems in
each industry. And I'll just illustrate three examples if I may. In retail, many people
with the shift to e-commerce want to understand how can they get the expertise of
Google Search, but on their website to help people ﬁnd products faster. How do
they understand the behavior of the person, so they can personalize much richer,
and how do they get very accurate product recommendations. So we've used our
expertise in ML and AI and built a product oﬀering for search, one-to-one
personalization and recommendation, and then that then leads to more accurate
demand forecasting. Because once you understand what people are looking for, you
can be more accurate in forecasting demand. And that work is going on at Loblaws
and Home Depot and a variety of other places.
In ﬁnancial services many people said, when the shift to digital happened, people
wanted to accelerate the speed with which mortgages, loans, credit card
applications could be processed. And using our expertise in document processing
and our machine learning tools, we've helped enormously speed up the whole
lending industry. Yesterday, there was an announcement, for example of Lenddo
which is the primary lending platform in Australia, where they're using our machine
learning tools to automate the whole process of lending. We also have work going
on in ﬁnancial fraud detection based on our own expertise in payments and the
need to manage fraud and we're working with many of the leading institutions there.
So in each industry not only are we providing horizontal technology, but we are also
taking important business problems and providing solutions to those business
problems, and they help us obviously get much deeper into accounts. They help us
deliver value oriented oﬀering rather than infrastructure alone, and it opens many
doors for us as a new entrant into the cloud space.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Very-very clear. Thank you, Thomas. Maybe to touch on some of the most strategic
customer and partner relationships that you have, you have an impressive list of
customers, world's leading brands like Ford, Target, Univision, even Deutsche Bank.
Can you talk about the nature of some of your most strategic longer duration
agreements? And how often might be even involved oﬀerings from other Google
divisions, whether it be YouTube or Android, for example?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 12Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Thomas KurianYou know the fundamental thing Brad that we see is that with the shift to digital,
many-many organizations are wanting to go directly to customers, whether that's a
car company wanting to understand customers and oﬀer products directly to
customers, whether that's ﬁnancial institutions that were traditionally focused on
institutional ﬁnance, wanted to oﬀer new products and services. So, the deepest
partnerships we have are those that connect the broad consumer ecosystem and our
understanding of that digital consumer ecosystem with their technology
infrastructure. And if you look at all of the big partnerships we've announced, many
span Alphabet, but they are above bringing those two ecosystems together and we
are uniquely positioned because we have deep technology expertise to help
enterprises, but we can also bring the consumer ecosystem and our history with
them and our reach with them brings back together. And just a few examples, if you
look at Univision, their vision is to be the leading Spanish language broadcaster, but
also to deliver news services, not just to oﬀer broadcasting, to the broad market in
Latin America. It requires them to understand how to deliver high quality over-the-air
type services, which we have expertise in. But we also have lots of deep expertise in
search and ads and YouTube, that all of that can be brought together to help
Univision.
If you look at Ford, they wanted to transform every aspect of the vehicle experience.
The way that somebody goes online, looks at their product, experiences their
product and buys it. So our expertise in search and ads helps there. How people
experience the car when they're in the car, and so our experience with Android for
example and our Google Automotive Services in the car can help people. And then,
how the car can be manufactured better, how the data from the car can be
processed to deliver predictive maintenance, warranty management, et cetera that's
where our cloud technology comes in. And so, as products as industry is digitized,
there's need to link that consumer ecosystem and the experiences with the
enterprise technology footprint, really gives us an opportunity not just to work with
these companies as a cloud technology provider, but as a transformation partner.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Makes a lot of sense. And along the lines of every company wanting to be closer to
its customers and drive better experience. Google is obviously in a very strategic
position to help them there. With respect of time maybe just a few more others we
can take through. I don't want to forget Google Workspace. Millions of organizations
and over 3 billion users rely on workspace for collaboration and productivity. This
product suite is, really come a long way and what do we need to know about
Workspace in terms of the investments Google is making in the long-term
aspirations for this product?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
We are seeing huge interest and strong growth in Workspace because of three
important things that we see changing the nature of work. First of all, the people
who want digital tools to collaborate, most products were written for the sort of
professional, some people call it white-collar workforce, which were oﬃce workers.
But in many industries, for instance, we work with Ascension Health in the healthcare
and they have far more nurses and doctors than they have professional oﬃce
workers and those people today need collaboration tools. A nurse talking to aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 12Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Thomas Kurianpatient wants to consult a doctor, they have a smartphone, they want a tool and a
product for communication and collaboration that was optimized for that
experience. So, our product helps these, some people call them ﬁrst-line workers to
collaborate in new ways.
The second is, traditionally tools were designed only for collaboration within the
boundary of an organization. But now with digital taking over many companies want
to collaborate beyond the boundary of the organization. And when I say beyond the
boundary of an organization, Airbus a big client of ours, they want to collaborate not
just for Airbus employees, but they want to collaborate with their vendors, they want
to share their demand forecast, their supply requirements with all their suppliers and
they want a tool that will help them in a platform to share collaborate in a secure way
outside the boundary of the organization.
The third is, we're seeing a lot of interest in digitizing workplaces and digitizing
workplaces for example, a bank, a retail branch of a bank is ac digital oﬃce, is a
oﬃce for the tellers who service clients. Now, many ﬁnancial institutions are talking to
us about using our collaboration platform, but as a vehicle to create a digital branch.
And so, these are also, it's digitizing oﬃces and workplaces that no longer can be
just physical, but need also a digital representation. All three are driving growth of
the Workspace. And lastly, because communication is so private and lots of
corporate data happens to be exchanged in a private fashion over email for
example, we're seeing a lot of interest because of the security of Workspace, and so
we have clients whether it's Nielsen that does audience analysis and shares data to
help people be more targeted in marketing, whether it's Netﬂix, which is using our
collaboration tools to help their creators work together in a more eﬀective way,
whether that is ﬁnancial institutions, using us to communicate clients in new ways,
hospital systems. All of these new collaboration platforms and Google Workspace
was designed for that view mode of communication working together.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Thank you for that Thomas. I have two more topics I'd like to touch on before we
ﬁnish up the session. Maybe just ﬁrst on the infrastructure footprint that you have.
Last I checked Google has 27 regions, 82 zones, 146 edge locations. What does
steady state look like or is there such a thing? And how much of the global market
can you now address with your current infrastructure footprint? And what determines
when and where you expand?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
I mean, we continue to expand in markets because as we see demand for the
markets, in diﬀerent markets, we are bringing our technology closer and closer by
going to each country. So, we've expanded, for example, in India, in Melbourne. We
have an announcement just earlier this week in Germany, with a big expansion in
Germany. And you'll see us continue to broaden our regional footprint. That said,
even on top of that, as cloud becomes an important technology infrastructure in
diﬀerent countries, there are new regulatory requirements coming in, this notion of
sovereign cloud and the ability to require data to be located in each country. And we
have capability on top of our cloud to provide this sovereign capability in many-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)

Q - Brad Zelnickmany diﬀerent parts of the world and that's also broadening our addressable market
because we're meeting these regulatory requirements.
Lastly, we've also introduced new products for organizations that need super low
latency and they say, well, look, I love to move everything to the cloud, but I have an
application that's running for example, in the mainframe, but I want your analytic
tools next to mine. We've also introduced private cloud oﬀerings that can now run
inside a corporate data center. And so, broadening our regional footprint, moving
into private cloud or hybrid cloud with the new oﬀering and then addressing
sovereign clients, these are all about continuing to expand our total addressable
market, and providing new opportunities for people to work with us and use our
technology.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
That makes perfect sense, Thomas. And maybe just to ﬁnish out, proﬁtability.
Operating loss has improved in the last couple of quarters. Have you reached an
inﬂection point in proﬁtability and how do you think about steady state margins for
the business?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
I'll say what Ruth and I have said before and what Sundar and Ruth talked about in
the last earnings call. We continue to invest in the business, we continue to invest in
the business to scale the business and to build the right product and services for
customers. As you know Brad, this is a economies of scale business, because there's
certain amount of investment you have to you have in products, certain amount of
investment you have to have in a network of data centers, certain amount of
investment that you need to have in a go-to-market organization. and the larger you
get that amortizes is across a larger customer base and a larger revenue base. So, we
are very focused as Ruth has said, on investing to ensure we succeed in the market,
and you've seen our growth and as we grow, and given the fundamental nature of
the cloud business, we have shown that we've been able to improve margins.
