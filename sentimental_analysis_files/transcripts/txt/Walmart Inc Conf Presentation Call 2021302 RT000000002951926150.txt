{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Well, good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today virtually at Raymond
James 42nd Annual Institutional Investor Conference. For those that have not had
the chance to meet in person I am Bobby Griﬃn and cover consumer hardlines and
retail here at Raymond James. Today I'm pleased to introduce Brett Biggs, CFO of
Walmart. Also in attendance virtually from the company is Kary Brunner, Senior
Director of Investor Relations.
So today's format will be a ﬁreside chat between Brett and I. But before we begin let
me remind you that there may be forward-looking statements made today. So,
please refer to Walmart's website for the full legal safe harbor statements. Brett ﬁrst,
thank you for joining us. We really appreciate the support and I must say I hopefully
look forward to doing this in person next year in sunny Orlando.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, it's always a great way to start the year actually as with you guys down in Florida,
so hopefully we'll get that work done next time.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Absolutely. So maybe just to get us started. You guys just released a great ﬁscal
fourth quarter and hosted an Investor Day. So maybe you can talk a little bit about
what you're seeing from the U.S. consumer? And how you think COVID-19 has
shaped the competitive environment as we move here in to calendar year 2021?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, it's amazing. I'm sure it's on everybody's mind that basically we're coming
around to a year from when COVID became a real challenge in United States. So aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

Brett Biggslot has changed if we would have tried to guess a year ago where we were going to
be its it would have been really diﬃcult to predict and there's been so much
diﬃculty and challenge around the world with health of families and friends and so
that's been top of mind from a business standpoint it's been a challenging year but a
good year for the company and it accelerated a number of things from a strategic
standpoint that fortunately we were -- we were prepared for maybe to take a little
longer than it took everything accelerated, but we're prepared to be in an omni-
channel retailer the ecosystem becoming larger and so we're ready for all those
things and have beneﬁted us during the year.
The customers just had to evolve as we've gone through this year and we went if you
go back to last March and April when stock up was happening and then a stimulus
package, then the COVID numbers got really rough during the summer, get a little
better in the fall get rough again in the winter and then so the customers had to
evolve through this. I think for the most part I feel it even here in our local area
people are getting out again more traﬃc seems like it's getting a little more
challenging. So they're wanting to get out, my guess is feels like you're watching the
same things I'm is feel like we'll get a stimulus package of some sort coming out I
think that will help folks will see how they spend it I do think people will spend
probably a little diﬀerently GM will be important to people but also people ready to
go on vacations and do other things like that. So they'll probably spend the money a
little diﬀerently maybe than they did last year. I think the consumers doing okay
particularly overall, particularly with the stimulus packages that are coming out,
depends on which industry you've been in the travel industry or service industry
hotel, restaurants that's been certainly challenging but overall I think the consumers
continue to spend money, we've beneﬁted from that last year and I believe we will
continue to do so this year.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Okay, and maybe just touch a little bit on when you look at the potential tailwinds
and headwinds for 2021, obviously a lot of moving parts, your business has
performed extremely well. It's been a little bit diﬀerent of a mix but if we do return to
more of a quote-unquote normal environment. What does that mix shift do from a
headwind or tailwind perspective?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. This is exciting this year. We gained market share in a number of general
merchandise categories where we've been looking to strengthen the business and
that helps both from a customer stickiness standpoint also from a margin mix
standpoint if you saw during the year for us from a proﬁtability perspective. That's
going to continue to -- I think that will continue to evolve I feel good about our
business as we go through this year as you mentioned just a number headwinds and
tailwinds and that's why I made even giving guidance more challenging than
typically would be. If the news on the vaccine front appears really positive and so it's
possible that maybe things just get back to normal more quickly than even some of
us expect which would be fantastic. People are going to spend money a little bitFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

Brett Biggsdiﬀerently, there's pent-up demand certainly for travel. I'm sure everybody on this
call would love to get out and take a vacation.
But at the same time the work we've done on general merchandise side on the
marketplace side that's going to beneﬁt us going forward. We had limited operating
hours for quite a bit of last year, those oﬀering are starting to come back that will
beneﬁt us and as customers involved last year I think value started taking a little bit
of deﬁnitely backseat to convenience. People maybe were shopping a little closer to
home or shopping in a smaller store I think that comes back our way as we get to the
year. So there's all these headwinds and tailwinds and I even said in my comments at
the at our investor meeting the balance of those is what will determine where we
end up for the year, but I feel really good in any case about how the consumer will
respond to the oﬀerings that we have.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Great, and maybe let's shift gears a little bit and touch on a few key topics from the
recent Investor Day, two important ones that stood out to us as well as probably a lot
of investors were the new ﬂywheel, the new Walmart ﬂywheel that was discussed as
well as the accelerating of automation investments. So I guess ﬁrst let's hit the
ﬂywheel. Can we unpack that concept a little bit; discuss some of the key
components and then what that sets the business up going forward?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, it's been fun helping evolve that because it's, as I came into the company almost
21 years ago now, the productivity loop was it was so prevalent everything that we
talked about and it's really just kind of the modern-day productivity loop. It's just
diﬀerent than it used to be. And the business ﬁve years ago looked very diﬀerent
than it does today even from a P&L perspective. It's going to look diﬀerent again
three years, four years, ﬁve years from now. But it's still at the top of that, getting that
customer engagement at the top and we're always thankful for the people that
Walmart they got us into the grocery business decades ago because it allows us
away and an opportunity to really interact with customers on a regular basis through
that grocery business and ensuring that we're always the best in that and you know
Bob over the years we've put so much money in quality and the process in that part
of the business, so that will continue to be a really strong part of what we do, but
then that allows us to do some things better, faster, sharper than we've done in the
past.
We're growing a much bigger GM business both online and the stores, ﬁrst-party,
third party that has beneﬁts from a stickiness standpoint as well as a margin
standpoint. We've always had opportunities and we have businesses in health care
and ﬁnancial services how people interact with those things in the future is going to
be diﬀerent, tele-medicine for instance going to be much more prevalent than it was
ﬁve years ago. We like what we're doing with the clinics there's things that were
continue to evolve and change with those but we like those and then you about the
ﬁnancial services joint venture that we just did with Ribbit.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

Brett BiggsAnd then there's just other ways for us to make money. So you keep kind of coming
around on the ﬂywheel whether it's advertising or data, marketplace, fulﬁllment
services for sellers there's ways for us to make money in a diﬀerent way. And in
higher margin businesses, which helps mix out diﬀerently than we have in the past.
We're always going to be sharp on operating costs. And that's -- that was always a
big part of the productivity loop but, still a big part of the ﬂywheel and all of this then
allows us to continue to evolve the customer experience which is going to continue
to be important and given the balance sheet that we have and the momentum that
we have, there's things that we can do from an investment standpoint, you
mentioned automation that competitor just can't, they can't do, they can't do at the
pace that we're going to do them at and so we felt like this was the right time to
really lean in on innovation and capacity both.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Yep. How do you see maybe some of those building blocks you talk about of that
you know that new ﬂywheel translating across the diﬀerent business segments, you
have a powerful U.S. business and a ecommerce business that's in some fast-
growing markets and then Sam's Club just got it done, having another tremendous
year.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, that ﬂywheel is really, it translates really well to most of our markets and Sam's
Club, well, it's a little bit diﬀerent there still elements of that ﬂywheel that were now,
at the top of their ﬂywheel is going to be -- they have a big food business but is that
treasure hunt and the excitement of item merchandising that you get at Sam's Club
it's a little bit diﬀerent. But all of these things that we're doing they translate in a
place like Mexico, they translate in a place like Canada, China is little diﬀerent with
the formats, the Sam's Club does tremendously well in China and then India, there's
so much upside in the India with the emerging middle market there. So that's why
it's been fun to evolve this ﬂywheel because it has so many applications really in
everything that we do inside the company. It ﬁts really well.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
And then maybe to pivot over to the automation side another big topic there from
the Investor Day, but -- accelerating those investments in the supply chain
technology automation of the supply chain. So, if my understanding of the strategy
these investments should ultimately make your fulﬁllment both faster and more
eﬃcient, give you some more capacity. So is there any numbers you could put
behind that or what some of these changes might mean for your grocery business or
some of your other type businesses?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, there's all of the places that we're going to lean in from a capital standpoint are
things that we've had in the works in, so particularly in the supply chain side. We've
been talking about for a while, things that we've been doing around, automation inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

Brett Biggsthe back room of the stores for instance to make grocery fulﬁllment easier,
particularly on the pickup side, and then we've been doing, we've been involved
and really on the leading edge of things like already pallets, that go straight to store,
go straight out of the ﬂoor and so these aren't things ﬁve years ago, these are things
that were just starting now, there's things that we see are working and we can roll
them out, feel more conﬁdent about the rollout than we would have been even a few
years ago.
So I'm really excited about supply chain, innovation and that helps top line. So when
we talk about growth numbers of 4 plus percent at some point some of that is
coming from capacity, but also the ability to fulﬁll more quickly and then deﬁnitely
from an eﬃciency standpoint. The kind of good dollars that we're talking about on
capital unless you can get top line and eﬃciency. It's -- you need both of those
things to have the conﬁdence to make the kind of capital investments that we're
making so I'm excited on both fronts.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Okay, and where it is you know this year you turned on a bunch of stores very quickly
kind of highlighting the ﬂexibility of the model -- yeah -- the right attitude --
(Multiple Speakers)
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Give what the operators did it's pretty amazing.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Yes. So where it is, when you kind of look out, this new world of accelerating
ecommerce, accelerating automation where does shift from store ﬁt into the Walmart
distribution model?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, it does ﬁt and I the great, again we learned so many things during COVID, and
some of which for everybody was a bit of a ﬁre drill and that things are coming at
you so quickly and you need to react really quickly. But we learned so much about
our own capacity our capabilities, our ability to move quickly, the speed at which we
turned on stores to ship was pretty amazing. We always knew that could be a part of
what we wanted to do. And now we know not only probably should it be long term
we know we can do it and we can be very adaptable with it.
So what I would say Bobby and I mentioned this some in my analyst presentation is
we feel like we have a lot of options. We have a lot of optionality on how to get to
the customer experience we want, and how we get to the P&L that we want. Both of
those things are important. But there's a lot of diﬀerent ways to come at it and
depending on how the year goes or how the customer changes over the next fewFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

Robert Griﬃnyears, we have a lot of things that we can turn on and oﬀ or hybrid of some of these
things that just will allow us to attack, attack the customer solution I think more
aggressively and more broadly than competitors, maybe.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
And from a maybe longer-term perspective these investments, the automation kind
of the work and the new ﬂywheel. How does that you look past the initial phase of
this? How does that set the business up for revenue growth and operating income
growth, on a more consistent -- on a more long-term basis going forward versus --
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, it should and that's why we wanted to be a little more explicit about the types of
growth that we wanted to see out of the business and again it, it depends some on
when stimulus comes and all these types of things, how you count things like that
but you know a 4% type revenue growth for Walmart is a big number. It's a Fortune
100 company basically every year that you're putting on top of this already large
company. But if we do that then the ability to we don't we don't necessarily need
that level of sales growth to get the leverage that we want. But if you get that kind of
sales growth, the ability to leverage expenses diﬀerently, ability to grow operating
income faster than sales, fairly standard basis we should be able to do those things
and that's why we felt it was important to talk about that at our analysts day. We
wanted to give some indication to investors of why we want to increase the level of
CapEx that we've --
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
And building oﬀ some of that a little bit more into the capital allocation side always a
very important topic from a Walmart investor standpoint. How does the new ﬂywheel
and some of those investments drive the thinking of capital allocation over this new
period kind of that we're into for the business?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, it's really clarifying its now your capital, every dollar capital you should be able
to tie back to I always talk to people internally about taking now this ﬂywheel the
strategy the ﬂywheel taking it putting on a wall and saying is how I'm spending my
day every day, how we're spending dollars the people, that we're hiring, the capital
we're spending does it match up what we just said, then doesn't we need to rethink
it. We've got to commit every dollar we have to fulﬁlling that strategy because we
believe that strategy is the right strategy and I think that's been proven over the last
few years, but that's it's the north star of how we think about expense and capital
allocation.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Okay, and maybe let's switch into some of the segments ﬁrst, on the U.S. side
ecommerce 2020 marked an incredible year for the U.S. ecommerce business, butFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 14Brett Biggs
Robert Griﬃn
Brett Biggsnot only in growth I mean it was a year that we narrowed the losses again -- move in
the right direction. So maybe can we unpack some of the drivers there that help that
performance, and narrowing the loss is really important?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, we were even two years ago, we're starting to talk about we were saying various
pieces of the puzzle that we're starting to come together in a way that was positive.
The top line is kind of always been there, but we were starting to see improvement in
contribution margin and some of that was, it just the way we merchandize mix as
well, higher margin, we told you we're going after higher margin categories we did
that. Some of those fulﬁllment costs and as you get more leverage through your
building you just start leveraging expenses diﬀerently, as sales go up you start
covering cost diﬀerently.
So it is all these things that we were working already last year, get the 79% growth
that we got this year, all of that starts working the way that you wanted to. So now
we're standing -- we're getting the volume through the system that we knew was
going to get us in the place that we want it to be. So we're seeing the beneﬁts of that
and now bringing together the organization structurally to more closely align to one
organization patient now under John has really been helpful. And I think we're going
to continue to see beneﬁts out of how we might merchandise? How we go to market
with customers? How we manage margin. I think all of that is just going to be
simpler.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Okay and two big parts of that, a lot of focus on is the 1P and 3P mix. As well as the
new business within advertising that's kind of the newer push. So maybe ﬁrst on 1P
versus 3P some of the investments the team has made to position that aspect, here
in 2021 and beyond and where you like the ideal mix of that to be and then we'll
switch over to advertising after?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, both are important 1P and 3P. We've had a fairly small three, but growing 3P
business and some of that's been intentional to ensure that we can deliver the value
proposition that we want and the customer experience that we want. But we've
accelerated that more; we've accelerated more on the seller tool side to make it
easier for sellers to come onto the platform. Some of the capacity will be adding will
help us in Walmart fulﬁllment services that's a big part of what we want to do as well
as help with third-party sellers and we don't have a real, I don't have a mix in mind of
what I'd like those to be. I want them to get to their natural level of where they
should go. We do know third-party sellers really like us as a place for them to grow
their business. Today, there's not a ton of places for them to go and we're one given
our size and scale that's a very obvious place and we should continue to help them
build their businesses. So we're excited about that, the timing is right and it's very
good from a proﬁtability standpoint, margin mix standpoint for us as well. But we
want to grow both of those businesses we think they're very important.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

Brett Biggs{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Okay, and advertising is really starting to come into focus here a little bit more.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. It's a growing business for us.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Yes, maybe talk about the strategy of that business and what some of the early
customer responses are as you guys have pushed more into that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, and it's another business where we've been a little bit deliberate and that
customer experience and is important and that we want to make sure, we're not
confusing them, we're not putting too many things in front of them that they can
trust us that when we recommend an item for them that it's us recommending to
item it's those kind of things that we've been very thoughtful about but -- we've
gotten in a place with their own leadership team this time to accelerate that so we've
got a decent sized business already. We don't talk about it that much because inside
a Walmart is still fairly small but it's a decent a decent sized business. But we think it
can grow multiples of what it is today, and help us partner more closely with
suppliers. There's the number of eyeballs that we have on our sites in our stores is
pretty amazing.
So we already have the ability to go acquire customers is actually fairly inexpensive
for us because we've already got the traﬃc. We just need and it's like this data
monetization, ﬁnancial these are things like that. We've got the traﬃc. We don't have
to necessarily go build these, the traﬃc and it is business we've got it. We just now
need to get people to interact in our ecosystem a little diﬀerently than they have in
the past.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
So all those moving parts, between the advertising growing, 3P growing, the mix
shift, leveraging ﬁxed costs, all those seem like permanent type aspects that should
continue going forward. How does that change the algorithm of the U.S. segment's
operating income potential and growth? Yes.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, it changes the way I used -- I have been in this role a little over ﬁve years now
and the way we think about the P&L tells a little diﬀerent than it was ﬁve years ago,
but it's healthy it's good and I feel like we have many more options of how to
generate the ﬁnancial results we wanted, in fact we have more options than we did
ﬁve years ago. So I like that -- I think it's going to feel even better ﬁve years from nowFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

Brett Biggsand it does today as far as far as optionality. Go back ﬁve years ago, when we
announced we need to make investments in wages and ecommerce, but we also
said we need to invest in price more aggressively at that point. And so you had a
period of time where gross margin rate was coming down, OpEx was coming down
but not at the same rate and so operating income is going down as a company some
in the U.S. as well. I don't think that has to be the case going forward. I think we'll
invest in the business. I think we still leverage expenses. I'm not concerned about
that longer term. But there's opportunities for gross margin -- to look diﬀerent from a
rate perspective than that I think we might have even though a few years ago, there's
higher margin businesses that we're in, the general merchandise business is
encouraging, marketplace encouraging. So I think it does change, it does give
additional optionality to the U.S. group in particular.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
It seems like it would give chance for even U.S. operating income maybe outpace
sales growth, if those parts ﬂow in that way?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, we said that as a total company so it's pretty tough to do anything -- that
you can't do in that U.S. segment. Although, international now with the markets we're
in, it's going to be higher growth, should be higher growth from a proﬁtability
perspective to another investment some things in Mexico and Canada in the short
term as well. But so that dynamic -- international dynamic should change them as
well and will help but it's U.S. businesses still pretty big to the total.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
And the prices, the price investments is another aspect that we focus on I mean,
sometimes we get push that Walmart seems always being price investments, gross
margin under pressure, continually and the team's tone and kind of outlook there is
change a little, so maybe just talk about how you feel the business is competitively
priced with fears and kind of that potential for gross margins as we talked about to
be a little diﬀerent now because of that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, there's a lot of pieces to that gross margin equation. That's, it's how you buy, it's
how you price, it's how you move goods. And now it's, all these alternative
businesses that we can be and as well that help. Price is always going to be
important to us where it's always going to be a big of our equation. We were really
aggressive particularly in the food side over the past few years and feel like our price
gaps are in a really good shape actually, and that I think gives us optionality as well
how to strategically invest in price and places that we feel like we need to won't have
to be everywhere. But it's still going to be a big part of what we do, that value
equation for customers and we mentioned earlier over the last year or so customers
have -- looking to things other than value. They always -- the convenience, alwaysFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

A - Brett Biggsgoing to be important, but they'll look like they're going to continue to look for value
and maybe even more so as we come out of this just like they used to.
So but price is always going to be a big part of that. But we're going to -- we're
strategic about it, we're thoughtful about it, we're sharp about it. And so I view it as
one tool we have.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Okay. And maybe to switch gears a little bit but on the -- other interesting thing
that's pop it up more is the other services and revenue opportunities that the
business is ﬁnding, whether its ﬁnancial or ﬁntech in that area or healthcare or as we
just talked about advertising. So as we sit here today, which opportunity do you think
has the most potential over the long term?
Questions And Answers
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
(Question And Answer)
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean it's like asking which one's your favorite child. I mean they're all
exciting. They're all diﬀerent. They all have diﬀerent potentials. Some may perform
better and that (inaudible) why I like about them. They're all really diﬀerent from
each other, but they're all connected to what can we do at the base of the business.
So we're going to continue to really go after these businesses and it's not. I had a
question earlier actually from investor that asked, are we looking at these looking at
these as proﬁt pools, or is it just a way to get people into the ecosystem? And the
answer is both. We want them as a way to get people more into the engage with the
ecosystem, but these businesses are going to -- they're going to stand on their own.
They're a proﬁt opportunities in these businesses.
So that's why I'm excited about them. And we feel like we can invest, certainly for
period of time invest kind of have been all of them to give them a push forward and
we'll see how it goes and we'll ﬁnd some things in a work like we think, and we'll ﬁnd
some, we'll be talking about new opportunities three years from now, we're not
talking about today. So just kind of how it works.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
And maybe on the healthcare, Walmart Health I mean that one's been an issue for a
little bit longer maybe the other ones. But obviously with this year, Healthcare came
to the focus of pretty much everybody's mind. So any update there the Walmart
Health strategy kind of the build-out of those centers, the responses from customers
or even the doctor side of that business.

Q - Robert GriﬃnI was in one. It's been a little while now, because of COVID that was in one -- one of
our ﬁrst ones, we opened up in Georgia and customers love what we're doing. I
mean the ability to come in and get some fairly basic services done in a simpler way
with a good pricing structure. The doctors love it, because they can spend more time
taking care of patients and not necessarily all the paperwork. So they like the fact
that they get to take care of people. So the model we know works, still got to work
through the mix of services and doing the way certainly that it makes money and but
we're working our way through all that. You'll continue to see us roll those out. We
have a new Head of our Healthcare business, Cheryl Pegus is really good. I've spent
some time with her over the last few weeks, excited about what she's going to do.
Cheryl have her own take obviously in what she thinks we should do as a company.
But it'll be in the lines of what we've been talking about, Bobby and I think
healthcare is going to continue to -- it's going to evolve -- today, it evolve over the
next several years, telemedicine is going to be a much bigger thing than it was in the
past things like that. So I'm excited about it. There's a lot we can do there and the

And maybe going to Sam's Club. Another area that you really (inaudible) incredible
year. So I didn't want to get out of this presentation without asking at least a question
or two on them. Talk a little bit about some of the investments that they have been
made there to position, reposition the business to obviously very big growth now,
we're seeing in it. And they kind of how those could maybe be sustainable going
forward?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. We like 15, 16 comps, (inaudible) and tobacco will take every year. When John
was over there, he made a number of changes, really got the organization, really
geared into technology and it became a bit of a lab for the rest of the company and
what technology can do and what they did with scan and go with some of the things
they did around. Making membership easier to manage and then Kath has come
over and continued that, but Kath's a real focus on the member and making sure that
membership is valuable and the memberships are really obviously really important
part of why people want to be a part of a membership club, no surprise there. And
so Kath is really putting her own mark on that from the membership perspective.
But I like what Sam's is doing. Its -- I spent three of my own years there and it's such a
great part of the business and you can -- it's an item level business. It's a relationship
business and we get a lot of learnings out of it for the rest of the organization. It's
really helped us from a tech perspective.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
And with position for growth now and some of the positive signs of member growth
and stickiness of customers all the good stuﬀ. Are we at a period where maybe we
start to see some new units out of Sam's or is there's some markets that there could
be some new store expansion opportunity in?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

Yeah. Its -- you never say, never. I think we feel pretty good about our U.S. store base
whether it's super centers or Sam's Club and I do think it's more about how you get
that member to engage with you diﬀerently with things like pick up, samsclub.com,
it's probably more along those lines than a bunch of new units.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Okay, and from a vendor side of things. I mean, obviously a challenge for everybody
through 2020 was vendor constraints and keeping up with the mix shifts of what
people were buying. But how is -- as we enter now calendar year 2021, how was the
supply chain. We working our way back towards normal and kind of what are you
hearing from vendors on availability of products?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Pretty challenging year. Quickly go back and look at, what you were looking for last
April and May.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
I think Doug said at one point there is what a roll of toilet paper sold for every
person in America or something. I remember things --
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think maybe people still digging out of that from their homes from earlier
pandemic. There's still a few things that are -- if you go in our stores today versus six
months ago, the in stock looks a lot better than it did, it's still not completely back in
everything versus where we would like it to be. But it's getting there feels -- it feels a
lot more normal. I think there's going to be certain things that are just given
everything is going on the world. There's going to be some challenges, probably
that'll last for a little while longer but nothing that's dramatic, that's impacting the
business in a big way. We're in a lot of diﬀerent categories and so that helps.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Okay. And I guess two things maybe to end up with. We have a few more minutes
left. Walmart once again taking a forefront on helping deploy the vaccine. So talk
about some of the quick developments that team had to do there and kind of that
customer response and being part of that, help them --
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, I am proud to be able to do that. I mean there's nothing more important right
now for the world than the distribution of this type of vaccine, and the people that
want to be vaccinated making sure they get it as quickly as they can. So I'm proud of
the company for what we've been able to do. And every state is a little diﬀerent as
you know and how they roll it out and so the operators have been very ﬂexible and
working with the government and the state agencies where we can help. But that's
the main thing. We want to be part of the solution on this and obviously some of ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

can be doing right now.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
And then what about -- a lot of things going on positive at Walmart, one of the things
that was really stuck out the last couple of years has been the ESG work and that and
investment associates. So maybe let's spend some time and talk about A the
investment associates and B some of the other ESG initiatives that the company is
taking part of now?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, and I'll split them apart, because -- diﬀerently. I mean the investment. I'll start
with wages. The investment in wages is, it's important -- the announcement we just
made toward the average. So making over $15 an hour and we've raised wages for
almost 600,000 people on just over the past quarter or so. It's important to ensure
that we recognize associates important to ensure that we stay competitive and that
we can get the people that we want and retain them and particularly in these jobs
around the omni eﬀorts and where we really go back to the strategy that really fulﬁlls
our strategy. So it's important. But these are business decisions and it should help
the business. So it's an investment, but it's something that should help the company.
We're wanting to make sure that we create this lot of opportunity for associates and
that they have the opportunity to get into the company, but then also progress to
jobs that have higher wages. So I think we have a good approach. I like the approach
that we're taking.
On ESG. Couple of years ago people were saying. Investors going to start asking a
lot of questions about ESG. I'd say, it's great. It's such a great story for us and I think it
doesn't get told maybe sometimes we don't get the story told as often as we would
like. But it's another place where for the most part ESG initiatives whether it's saving
energy, whether it's taking the water out of a product that we don't need. There's a
business beneﬁt for that. It's eliminating waste somewhere in the system, that's good
for our suppliers, it's good for us, it's good for our customers and it's great for the
planet. We just made an aggressive climate goal that we're going to be neutral by --
carbon neutral by 2040 without oﬀsets. It's a bold goal. I like it and I feel good about
our ability to go do it, because we wouldn't start on this journey -- 15 years ago. So
we've been at it for quite a while.
But it's sort of thing that makes me proud about the company that we can run the
kind of business that we do and do things that will be good for the planet and good
for my kids and good for your kids. And it's important part of what we do. I'm proud
of it.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
I think we've made it through my -- our list. We're right here on time. So I appreciate
-- I appreciate the support. Yes, it worked out well, but as always appreciate you
joining us here at the conference and support and best of luck here in calendar year
