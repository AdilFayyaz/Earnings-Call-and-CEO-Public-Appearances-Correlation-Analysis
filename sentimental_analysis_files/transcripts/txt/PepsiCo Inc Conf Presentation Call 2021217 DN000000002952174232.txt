Good afternoon, everyone. For those of you who may not know me, I'm Hugh
Johnston, PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Oﬃcer and I've been with
the Company for more than 30 years. I'm happy to be back at CAGNY again this year
and would like to thank you for the opportunity to discuss our Company's vision and
strategy.
Before I get started, I would like for you to please take note of our cautionary
statement. I'll spend time today providing a background on our business, our value
creation proposition, our ﬁnancial priorities and long-term growth targets and
conclude by brieﬂy discussing our outlook for 2021.
Before we get into the presentation, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our
employees who worked tirelessly through a challenging and uncertain environment
to service our customers, communities and consumers. Our employees are the
backbone of this organization and we could not be prouder of how they continue to
manage through the pandemic.
While most of you listening probably know us quite well, I will start with an overview
of our company and businesses. PepsiCo is one of the largest food and beverage
companies in the world with more than $70 billion in net revenue. Our foods and
beverages are consumed nearly a billion times each day in almost every country
around the world and we have a diverse portfolio of brands that consumers know
and trust with 23 brands in our portfolio, including Pepsi-Cola, Quaker, Tropicana,
Lays and Gatorade that generate more than $1 billion each in estimated annual retail
sales.
Our mission is to be the global leader in convenient foods and beverages by
winning with purpose. How we get there is comprised of a framework that involves
three simple priorities, becoming faster, stronger and better. Faster means winning
in the marketplace, being more consumer-centric and accelerating investment for
topline growth. Stronger means developing capabilities that can give us a
competitive advantage, building a diﬀerentiated organization, talent and culture and
funding these investments with what we refer to as holistic cost management. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-17

Page 2 of 10better means integrating purpose into our business strategy and becoming leaders
toward building a more sustainable food system.
We also have a balanced geographic mix with strong positions in large global
growing categories. Geographically, greater than 60% of our revenue comes from
North America with the remaining amount coming from our international markets.
And over time, we would expect our international markets to become a bigger part
of the business on a currency-neutral basis as the runway for growth remains
signiﬁcant in developing and emerging countries.
Categorically, our business primarily spans across snacks and beverages, which we
believe have complementary characteristics. We have a number one position in
snacks, with signiﬁcant runway for growth as per capita consumption opportunities
remain vast. And we're a strong global number two player in beverages and seek to
grow in markets where we have scale and competitive advantages and compete
rationally in other markets.
Our company generates approximately 62% of our net revenue, and approximately
68% of our core division operating proﬁt in North America, with our North American
beverage business being the largest contributor to revenue while Frito-Lay is the
largest contributor to our core division operating proﬁt. Our international businesses
make up the remaining 38% of our total net revenue and 32% of our total core
division operating proﬁt, with Europe and Latin America being the biggest
contributors
Our core division proﬁt margin is greatly inﬂuenced by category mix and if we
choose to own or franchise our bottling operations. For example, our strategic
decisions to own and operate a substantial portion of our bottling operations in
North America and Russia are important factors to consider when analyzing our core
division operating margin at PBNA and in Europe.
Within North America, most of our snacks and beverage products are primarily
distributed via our company-owned direct store delivery system, while certain
products are distributed via a warehouse delivery system. Product velocities, market
share and scale, category dynamics and of course, return on investment are all
important factors that are taken into account when considering go-to-market
distribution system.
I'll start with PepsiCo Beverages, which is a scale business that continues to be the
market share leader in the liquid refreshment beverage category, with a great
product portfolio of some of the most iconic brands, Pepsi, Mountain Dew and
Gatorade. These brands, along with many more help balance its portfolio mix
between both carbonated and non-carbonated beverages. And as I mentioned
earlier, we own and operate a substantial portion of the beverage bottling system in
North America.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-17
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 10Now I'll turn to Frito-Lay, which is a leading player in the macro snacking category.
Currently, Frito-Lay has a strong portfolio of salty and savory snacks and aspires to
increase our scale and presence across key adjacencies within macro-snacks such as
increasing presence for nutritious snacks and extending our existing brands into new
locations. In addition, Frito continuously innovates and refreshes its ﬂavor lineup by
localizing taste proﬁle for diﬀerent demographic cohorts and also increasing its
presence in emerging growth channels such as e-commerce by investing to support
our retail partners and our direct to consumer oﬀerings.
Rounding out North America, Quaker Foods includes well known and trusted brands
such as Quaker, Cap'n Crunch and Rice-A-Roni which account for most of its total net
revenue. While Quaker and Frito-Lay are reported a separate divisions, these
businesses report to the FLNA CEO internally. We believe this reporting structure
has and will continue to unlock innovation, growth and productivity opportunities
over time for this highly proﬁtable business with strong cash generative capabilities.
Moving to our international businesses. Our divisions operate on a regional basis
and incorporate both snacks and beverages. Approximately 65% of our international
net revenue is derived from snacks, while the remaining 35% is derived from
beverages. Our snacks business has leading market positions across many key
markets in both salty and savory snacks and we feel signiﬁcant per capita
consumption opportunities remain in developing and emerging markets.
Our international beverage business primarily competes within carbonated soft
drink, juice and dairy categories. Apart from our company-owned bottling
operations in Russia and a few other small markets, our international beverage
business is primarily franchised to strong third party beverage partners that have
greater scale and strong local execution capabilities. While all of our divisions have
local decision-making power to better serve customers in the regions, they do it so
on the backbone of the principles we set out two years ago.
Our set of principles, what we call The PepsiCo Way, primarily involves taking
consumer centric lens into everything that we do and empowering our employees to
act like owners. The heart of this agenda involves investing in our people and it is
something that we will continue to build on in years to come. I won't read every item
on this slide, but the key elements include being consumer-centric by constantly
innovating and factoring the end consumer into every decision we make, acting as
owners of the company and focusing to get things done fast.
Our culture and values also extend to what we call winning with purpose, which is a
framework that incorporates helping our communities grow. We believe there is an
opportunity to change how the world produces, distributes, consumes and disposes
a food and beverages to address the shared challenges we face. During the
pandemic thus far, PepsiCo has worked with more than 60 partners to support more
than 1,000 communities across the globe, providing more than 130 million meals
and $60 million in COVID-19 relief.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-17
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 4 of 10We also remain committed to helping our communities grow in the future. Let me
take you through some of the goals and initiatives we have in mind. With respect to
our environmental initiatives, we strive to make advancements in building a world
where plastic packaging need never become waste, sourcing ingredients through a
more sustainable and resilient agriculture, being even more responsible stewards of
water and doubling our climate goals by setting new goals this year and targeting
net zero greenhouse gas emissions and sourcing 100% of our global electricity
through renewable energy by 2040.
With respect to our social initiatives, one of our biggest focus areas includes
reaching gender parity in management roles by 2025. Currently, women make up
approximately 41% of our managers globally and we look forward to advancing that
ﬁgure in the future. Another big area of focus for us is our $845 million Racial
Equality Journey initiatives, which seeks to impact racial inequality and uplift
underprivileged communities over the next ﬁve years.
And lastly, we continue to look for ways to diversify our portfolio and improve
choices for our consumers by reducing added sugars, sodium and saturated fats in
many of our products. Our goal were at least two-thirds of our global beverage
portfolio volume is to have 100 calories or fewer from added sugars per 12-ounce
serving by 2025.
And with respect to governance, our director nominees bring diverse opinions and
perspectives with a well-rounded range of attributes, and approximately half of our
director nominees are women and/or ethnically diverse individuals and all but one
of our Board Members are independent. Our geographic mix, category brand
positioning, and our culture and values allow us to prioritize how we drive results for
our stakeholders, including our shareholders.
With that, let me move into our value creation proposition. Over the long term, we
have delivered an average 4% organic revenue growth. Our organic revenue growth
has accelerated since 2018, as we ramped up investments in our business and
brands in accordance with our framework to become faster, stronger and better.
Looking ahead, we believe we have the right portfolio and strategies in place to
maintain our long-term 4% to 6% organic revenue growth target. We believe we can
sustain this level of growth by evolving our portfolio to meet the changing needs of
our consumers by focusing on three strategic levers. First, it's about growing with our
largest brands. We accomplished this by revitalizing our large well-known brands on
an ongoing basis like Trademark Lays, Doritos, Mountain Dew and Pepsi through
ﬂavor extensions, diverse package mix oﬀerings and strong brand activation
campaigns, which continuously refresh these trademarks to meet the changing
consumer preferences.
Next, it's about delivering big ideas via consumer-centric innovation. A few examples
of this include; expanding our presence in the sports drink category with Gatorade
Zero and Bolt24 which, in aggregate, delivered more than $1 billion in estimatedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-17
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 5 of 10retail sales in 2020, creating and introducing a new successful sparkling water brand
with bubbly, which delivered more than $350 million in estimated retail sales in
2020 and continues to maintain a high single-digit value share of the category.
We're also lifting and shifting innovation by doubling the number of international
markets for our Flamin' Hot ﬂavor proﬁle and signiﬁcantly expanding the presence
and availability of our Pepsi Black or Zero Sugar innovation and working closely
across existing assets and brands to expand into new adjacencies, such as Cheetos
Mac 'N Cheese and Oﬀ the Eaten Path.
And ﬁnally, we've also addressed key strategic gaps in our portfolio through M&A.
Our acquisitions over the last few years, most notably Rockstar, Pioneer Foods, Be &
Cherry, SodaStream, BFY Brands and others helped ﬁll demand spaces where we
needed them the most. Currently, we are very happy with our portfolio and are
focused on maximizing the growth and returns from our assets.
As we move forward, we remain encouraged about our growth prospects as the
categories we compete in are very large and are expected to grow at mid-single-
digit rate. Speciﬁcally, we only command an approximate 9% share in a $570 billion
global LRB addressable market and an approximate 7% share in a $550 billion
global macro-snacks addressable market.
I'll next address how we're prioritizing our growth objectives. Starting with North
America, our primary objective is to outpace category growth within both snacks and
beverages by expanding our presence across macro-snacks in a disciplined and
value-enhancing manner to capture our fair share of daily occasions by rationally
competing and evolving our product and package mix oﬀerings across beverages to
meet the changing needs of consumers and expanding our presence in the highly
proﬁtable energy category. By evolving with our customers, we invest and expand
our presence and capabilities within the e-commerce channel and by advancing our
digital capabilities and modernizing our value chain and go-to-market systems to
continuously improve our demand forecasting and market execution. This seems to
deliver greater precision and value at the shelf for the consumer.
With respect to our international markets, our priorities for snacks versus beverages
vary to an extent. Our snacks is about increasing per capita consumption and
gaining market share. Much of this opportunity still lies within developing and
emerging markets such as Mexico, Brazil, Russia, China and India to name a few.
To support this ambition, we're investing in our snacks and foods growth capacity
and in digital capabilities to enhance our go-to-market and supply chain systems to
increase our speed to market and productivity. For beverages, we're taking a more
selective approach across markets and categories by better balancing between
growth and returns by market. In markets where we don't have leadership or
stronghold positions, we tend to operate with an asset-light franchise model with
partners who had scale, examples include Latin America, China, India and the UK
with an emphasis on carbonated soft drinks. However, another beverage marketsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-17
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 10where we do have scale, such as Russia, we own our bottling and distribution
operations to compete eﬀectively across both carbonated and non-carbonated
beverages.
Overall, in our largest markets where we have strong leadership positions such as
Mexico, Russia and the United Kingdom, we will continue to grow our core
categories and strategically expand our portfolio oﬀerings to capture growth in
attractive categories, channels and occasions. Our key growth regions, such as
China, India and South Africa, we will invest to increase penetration and per capita
consumption by ensuring aﬀordability, aﬃnity and availability.
With respect to aﬀordability, we will deploy business models that enable us to hit key
price points speciﬁc to each market. As it relates to aﬃnity, we will focus our biggest
global brands and product ranges with selective tailoring to maximize relevance to
consumer preferences. And for availability, we will build distribution and improve in-
store execution using service models enabled by technology. Sustaining or
accelerating our organic revenue growth with the set of priorities I've mentioned
today is just one component of a proﬁtable growth operation. To drive further
operating leverage, we are committed to delivering at least $1 billion of annual
productivity savings through 2023.
Our revenue growth and productivity initiatives are expected to more than oﬀset
ongoing pressures associated with wage inﬂation, geographic and channel mix
complexities, and ongoing capability investments in digitalization, information
technology systems and automation. In addition, we are also focusing on maximizing
the return and margin potential of recently acquired assets, which have also
pressured the margin mix within our portfolio. Netting these factors, we believe that
mid-single-digit organic revenue growth can translate into 20 basis points to 30
basis points of annual core operating margin expansion over the long term.
So let's dive a little deeper into the operating margin discussion, as it varies quite
signiﬁcantly across our businesses. As a result, we must address our business
priorities separately. Starting with PepsiCo Foods in North America or Frito-Lay and
Quaker Foods, our priority is to invest wisely to sustain or accelerate growth and
enhance our competitive advantages.
Our North America snacks and foods business is highly proﬁtable and well funded.
So it's more about capturing new consumer occasions, increasing productivity from
automation and digitization, investing in our brands through targeted marketing and
focusing on fewer bigger bets when it comes to innovation. For example, we will
look to sharpen our net revenue management initiatives through personalized
pricing and promotions, increased productivity initiatives by optimizing our network,
increasing automation and digitalization and utilizing new service models and
investing in additional capacity to fulﬁll demand for our multi and variety packs
across snacks.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-17
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 7 of 10When it comes to PepsiCo Beverages North America, we will compete rationally and
look to improve its core division operating margin by evolving our product portfolio
mix to improve growth and proﬁtability over time, by doubling down on our net
revenue growth management framework to drive aﬀordability, by reducing our non-
working A&M and shifting our working A&M to lower cost digital platforms, by
addressing manufacturing eﬃciencies and focusing on end-to-end integration within
our selling and distribution network and by leveraging our global business solutions
template to reduce our general and administrative expenses.
As it relates to our international markets, we believe investing to increase scale for
our snacks business and investing selectively in beverages will help deliver
compelling growth in some core operating margin expansion. Scaling our
international snack strategy means focusing on building more manufacturing
facilities and local innovation to drive per capita consumption. It also means oﬀering
greater value in select markets and building facilities around the lower cost
operating model in order to maximize proﬁtability.
For international beverages, we will compete rationally by strengthening our bottling
network in order to drive a higher margin concentrate model in most of our
international markets. However, when it comes to our international operating margin,
it's important to note that certain variables outside of our control, such as foreign
exchange movements and geopolitical uncertainty, can alter the margin trajectory.
Now that we've laid out our growth and proﬁt agenda, I'd like to spend some time
on capital allocation and cash ﬂow. To keep matters simple, our capital allocation
priorities remain unchanged and include investing in the business, paying and
growing our dividend, strengthening our portfolio through bolt-on M&A and
repurchasing shares while maintaining ample liquidity and access to the top tier
commercial paper market. However, given our strategic framework and growth
aspirations, we expect to prioritize capital spending and dividends over acquisition
activity and share repurchases in 2021. Additionally, we do not expect any further
share repurchases in 2021.
With respect to capital spending, we expect our investments to remain elevated and
then moderate in a few years. To provide clarity on where we are spending,
approximately 45% of our spending is geared towards growth capacity, more than
45% of our spending is towards operational necessity, digitization and generating
future productivity and the remaining 10% is related to our ESG initiatives.
Unpacking this a bit further, we are adding manufacturing lines to capture new
demand spaces while also unlocking capacity for constrained products in both
snacks and beverages. We're also automating and digitizing our supply chain to
ensure greater agility and speed to market for breakthrough innovation while
ramping up investments in our e-commerce channel. For example, we're leveraging
our additional manufacturing capacity to rebrand and reposition our Lay's Kettle
Cooked chips around bigger ﬂavors.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-17
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 8 of 10For beverages, we're looking to secure additional capacity and are developing plans
to increase speed to market in order to meet higher service levels for our Gatorade
brand. With respect to our supply chain, we are accelerating transformation in our
much needed digital capabilities in North America. These investments look to unlock
real-time inventory visibility, split sourcing and machine learning capabilities in order
to minimize complexity in a rapidly evolving marketplace. And as a company, we're
continuing to harmonize and simplify our technology systems and business
processes, which will drive productivity and help enhance our trade promotion
management, forecast accuracy and ﬁnancial planning.
We believe our capital spending investments behind our brands will better position
PepsiCo for the next phase of growth. However, the higher levels of investment have
pressured our free cash ﬂow conversion ratio in recent years, and we are working
diligently to reverse this trend over time. We feel we have an adequate amount of
capital and ﬂexibility to sustain these levels of investment. Should these investments
not show the desired returns we seek, we will not hesitate to adjust our plans.
In addition to investing in our business and building a better company for the future,
dividends remain an important component of our total shareholder return
proposition. And we have demonstrated our commitment on this front by
consecutively increasing our dividend over the last 49 years. I want to emphasize
that we remain conﬁdent today that we will maintain adequate levels of ﬂexibility to
pay and grow our annual dividend over time.
Beyond capital investments and dividends, we have also increased our M&A activity
over the last few years to ﬁll key portfolio gaps in the business. These gaps have
addressed key growth opportunities in snacks and beverages in both developed
and developing markets. For example, our SodaStream acquisition has beneﬁted our
global beverage business growth, as it addressed a key gap in our portfolio to oﬀer
more environmentally-friendly choices and customization to consumers.
Our Pioneer acquisition expanded PepsiCo's geographic footprint to uniquely
position itself in the attractive food space in Sub-Saharan Africa, an area with a
growing middle class and rapid urbanization. Our BFY brands acquisition was
complementary to our Frito-Lay product portfolio, as it expanded our Winning with
Purpose agenda to oﬀer consumers more nutritious options, while enabling popping
technologies to produce non-fried crispy snacks.
And most recently, our Rockstar acquisition expanded our reach in the fast growing
and highly proﬁtable energy category at a time when consumers' lives have become
busier. Strategically, this acquisition also provided PBNA with the ﬂexibility to
establish a broader portfolio of energy oﬀerings with both existing brands such as
Mountain Dew and partnerships that can leverage our existing distribution
capability.
But as we had anticipated, our recent acquisitions have pressured our core net ROIC.
However, I would like to emphasize that we are very pleased with the composition ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-17
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 9 of 10our portfolio and our priorities have shifted towards maximizing growth and returns
from these assets in a disciplined fashion that would be beneﬁcial for PepsiCo. As a
result, we do expect our core net ROIC to improve and follow a similar pattern to our
free cash ﬂow conversion trajectory after the next few years.
So, to conclude our discussion on capital allocation, we aim to preserve our ﬁnancial
ﬂexibility and liquidity to meet the needs of our business and return cash to
shareholders while maintaining an investment grade credit rating and access to Tier-
1 commercial paper. And as I mentioned earlier, we are prioritizing capital spending
and dividends over share repurchases and M&A in 2021 as investing in our business
is expected to unlock additional growth, improved ﬁnancial returns and build a
better company for the future and paying our dividend is an important component
when considering the decomposition of long-term total shareholder returns.
As it relates to our long-term objectives, we continue to aspire to deliver a good
balance between growth in income to drive value creation, which includes mid-
single digit increase in organic revenue growth, 20 to 30 basis points of core
operating margin expansion, high single-digit increase in core constant currency
earnings per share growth and a current dividend yield of approximately 3%.
And ﬁnally, our priorities for 2021 remain consistent with the framework we
discussed today. We will continue to strengthen our marketplace competitiveness by
investing in critical capabilities while continuing to focus on delivering our ﬁnancial
targets. To reiterate, what we communicated last week when we reported our fourth
quarter and full-year 2020 results, we expect to deliver mid single-digit organic
revenue growth and high single-digit core constant currency EPS growth in 2021.
Additionally, we expect our capital allocation priorities to focus on investing in our
business for growth in productivity and returning approximately $5.8 billion in
dividends to shareholders.
With that, I'd like to conclude this presentation and thank you again for your time
and attention today.
