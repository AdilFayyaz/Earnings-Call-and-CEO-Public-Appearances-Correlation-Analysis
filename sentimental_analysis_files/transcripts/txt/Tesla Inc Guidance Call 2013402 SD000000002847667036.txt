Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Tesla Motors conference call.
(Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce the host for today's call, Sarah
Meron. Please go ahead.
{BIO 17693920 <GO>}
Thank you, Patrick and good afternoon, everyone. This is Sarah Meron, Head of
Communications for Tesla Motors. Welcome to the call with Elon Musk, Tesla's
Chairman, CEO and Chief Product Architect, for a question-and-answer session
regarding today's announcement. The press release for the announcement is
available at www.teslamotors.com\press and a webcast of this Q&A is available on
the Tesla website as well. Today's call is for your questions. But we would like to keepFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

conduct the Q&A session live. (Operator Instructions)
During the course of this call, we may discuss our business outlook and make
forward-looking statements. Such statements are predictions based on
management's current expectations. Actual events or results could diﬀer materially
due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most
recent 10-K ﬁled with the SEC. Such forward-looking statements represent our views
as of today and should not be relied upon after today. We also disclaim any
obligation to update these forward-looking statements. And now I will turn it over to
Elon.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Thank you. So I know a lot of people are wondering what today's announcement was
going to be about and it's -- a lot of people are thinking, well, is it that we are going
to announce something revolutionary about service or some huge expansion of
superchargers or maybe something else that is pretty amazing that is right under
your nose if you are driving a Model S. We will make those announcements. But not
today.
We are going to put out a new announcement probably every week or two from
here on out. But today's talk is really about ﬁnancing. It is about trying to ﬁgure out
how we combine the best of ownership and leasing and we are really thinking like
there has got to be some better way than the traditional approach. And that is what
we are able to do working with Wells Fargo and US Bank was to come up with
something where essentially net of the tax credit, you can buy a Model S for no
money down net of the tax credit and around $500 a month. It can actually be less
than that depending upon what sort of tax deductions and what time savings you
gain. And I think that really makes it aﬀordable to a much broader audience than
people currently think is the case.
I know that when we did this with SolarCity, when we transitioned from a purchase
model to a ﬁnance model, it had a tremendous eﬀect on customer adoption and I
anticipate a similar eﬀect with Tesla.
Then we wanted to address -- in addition to addressing this sort of question of
aﬀordability, we also wanted to address the longer-term question of residual value or
peace of mind in buying an electric car. Because a lot of people think, well, what is
going to happen to an electric car? Is the battery going to depreciate much faster
than they expect? There is a lot of uncertainty.
So we wanted to eliminate that uncertainty. We felt the best way to eliminate that
uncertainty was to say, okay, we will match the residual value -- guarantee the
residual value of the Model S proportionate to that of a Mercedes S class, which is
made by our partner and investor, Daimler and that is an iconic car, it is one of the
most respected premium sedans in the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

Q - Damon Lavrinc
A - Elon MuskSo you see guaranteed to be on par in terms of residual value with one of the best
cars in the world. And not only is Tesla standing behind that. But I am personally
standing behind that to illustrate the level of conﬁdence I have in the long-term
value of the Model S. So really the goal there is to give customers complete peace of
mind. Like you do not have to worry about buying a car. Then to match the
convenience of a lease, you can just give us the car back after three years and we will
take it and either trade it in for another Model S or give you cash.
So you have all the convenience of a lease. But all the value of ownership because,
unlike a lease, you are not obligated to give us back the car for that amount. You are
welcome to retain it. So the car has greater value in that, which I think will. You have
the option to hang on to it if you would like. And so it gives you the right to give it
back to us. But not the obligation.
We are really trying to ﬁgure what is the best possible thing that we could give, if we
were a customer out there, what is the thing that we would want. And that is what we
are trying to construct here. And there may be some continued reﬁnements over
time as we try to make it even better. But I think we (inaudible) pretty great and I am
really excited about how people will respond to it. So with that, we can jump to the
questions.
Questions And Answers
Damon Lavrinc, Wired.
Thank you. I was hoping to get a rough estimate on what we are looking at as far as a
monthly payment is concerned? I realize that the partnership between the two banks
is going to consume some of that initial cost. What are we looking at as far as
monthly payments are concerned?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely. It is always important to look at net out-of-pocket. That is the thing
that really matters and this is where electric vehicles really shine because the cost of
electricity is maybe 10% to 20% that of gasoline per mile. So you actually -- if this was
your daily driver, that is where it really comes into play. The savings in gasoline per
month plus other factors like getting oil changes, smog checks, ﬁlters changed,
brake pads changed, on the Model S, for example, you never need to change the
brake pads because most of the braking is done regeneratively with the electric
motor.
There are actually huge savings that one experiences there and by having a monthly
payment, you actually really do see that diﬀerence. Whereas, if you acquire the car,
you still see that diﬀerence. But it is over a longer period of time. So eﬀectively, yourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

Q - Nichola Groomnet cost of ownership is maybe $500 or $600 a month and in fact, in some
circumstances, can be quite a bit less than that.
And I should mention we have a calculator on our website that you can then
customize as a consumer and say, okay, well this applies to me or this doesn't apply
to me and just basically adjust it to what your actual circumstances are and get a very
accurate number for what the net -- the true net out-of-pocket cost is per month for a
Model S. So we are trying to make it such that you can just -- you can just answer the
questions -- how do you -- how do you conduct your car ownership experience and
get a personalized number that applies to you.
Dana Hull, San Jose Mercury.
{BIO 18985841 <GO>}
Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. What kind of credit score do you need to
qualify for this lease and can existing reservation holders convert their reservation to
the lease model?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
The credit score information is something that is proprietary to the banks. There is --
you do need to be considered quite a good credit, I know, for the best terms. But we
see certainly a majority of our customers. And I think perhaps the super majority
qualifying for these loans. And unfortunately, this does not apply to prior purchases
of the car and because of the residual value guarantee, it only applies on a go-
forward basis. If we were to apply it retroactively, it would aﬀect the accounting in
past quarters.
So this is planned on a go-forward basis. But I should mention that our expectation is
that the residual value is for all Model Ses is in excess of what we are guaranteeing.
So the guarantee is really just there to give people peace of mind. Our expectation is
that the value of the car will actually be in excess of that number, all cars.
{BIO 18985841 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks.
Nichola Groom, Reuters.
Hi, thank you. I was wondering if you could just say why this was important to do?
You have always had a lengthy reservation list for your Model S and there seems to
be plenty of demand for it without this ﬁnancing product. Why was this important to
do?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

Q - Joe White
A - Elon Musk{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well I mean it is true. We do have plenty of demand for the car, even without a
ﬁnance product. But as much as possible, I would like to broaden the aﬀordability of
the car. It has always been my goal from the beginning of the Company to try to
make -- mass-market cars. I wish we could've done a mass-market aﬀordable car as
our ﬁrst car. It simply wasn't possible because it is going to take at least three major
iterations of the technology to get there.
However, by providing a compelling ﬁnancing solution for the Model S, we are
helping to broaden the access of customers to the car and I think that is a good
thing. So that is really our goal. We are really the business -- this announcement is
about improving aﬀordability, about giving people peace of mind and about giving
people the whole convenience factor of just being able to give us back the car for a
known amount of money in the future. And I think it is the right thing to do and I do
expect that that demand will respond accordingly. We have quite a big factory. So
we have a lot of room to grow.
Joe White, Wall Street Journal.
{BIO 15094359 <GO>}
Hi, just quickly. So this looks like the kind of product that most other car companies,
luxury car brands are already oﬀering. And I am curious what happens when, if I
decide I want to keep the car, what do I do? I mean keep paying on it? What
happens?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, I think you hit on a key diﬀerentiator, which is that if you want to keep -- with
what we are talking about here is you have the right to put the car back to Tesla at a
known price, which is the same percentage of residual value of a Mercedes S class.
But not the obligation. So like in contrast to a lease, if you want to buy the car at the
end of that lease, you have to pay that amount because you don't actually own the
car. But in our case, you can either get the preset amount, which is essentially --
which is equivalent to the residual value of the lease or you get to keep the car if it
has greater value and I think it will have greater value. So that is beneﬁcial to the end
customer.
{BIO 15094359 <GO>}
So if I make three years’ worth of lease payments, I can just keep the car?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Well you keep the car and I mean you continue paying -- it's not a lease per se. It
is a ﬁnancing essentially over ﬁve years. So you would continue paying your
ﬁnancing payments for the next couple years at which point you would have paid oﬀFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

A - Elon Muskthe loan and you would fully own the car. That is essentially what would happen. But
like I said, you have the right at the three-year point to put the car back to us for a
known amount of money or to retain it, pay oﬀ the remaining amount and own the
car.
{BIO 15094359 <GO>}
Okay, I don't want to overstate my time. But I just want to play that back to you. So
basically I am signing up for what amounts to a ﬁve-year loan. At year three, I can, if
for whatever reason I want to sell the car back to you, I can do that or I can just keep
paying?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
That is correct. You are essentially building equity in the car and I mean it is a loan
that you can collapse at any point as well. So that gives you additional ﬂexibility. So
this is a loan where you could sell the car, pay oﬀ your remaining principal at any
given point in the ﬁve years and be done. You are not locked in like a lease.
{BIO 15094359 <GO>}
Okay. All right, thanks.
Jim Motavalli, Car Talk.
Yes, Elon, you had mentioned at the beginning that this is somewhat based on the
SolarCity model and I believe you are Chairman of SolarCity run by your cousin. Is it
true that, in SolarCity, I believe you don't actually pay anything upfront for the lease
cost. If you could just talk a little bit about how that model, how successful it has
been and how that led to this model for Tesla. And also if you want to disclose your
net worth, (multiple speakers).
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I'd like nothing better than disclosing my net worth. What we found at SolarCity was
really pretty interesting because, in a sense, essentially the product that a customer
received at the end of the day was the same. They got solar panels on the house for
a particular power output. However, when we approached them and said would you
like to buy this system, some of these are sort of fairly expensive, like might be
$50,000, $60,000, people would look at that and say, well, I don't know if I want to
make that investment or I don't have the cash handy and it was just a harder thing to
get them to buy oﬀ on.
And we tell them that, look, this has got a payback period of ﬁve years. So within ﬁve
years, you have paid it back and then it is going to keep generating electricity from
there onwards. And we compare that to having a CD at the bank where somebody is
earning like maybe 2% and this would be like having a CD that earned 20%FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

Q - Mikhail Sabatguaranteed by the utility. And yet still people would have -- they would be reluctant.
It was a diﬃcult thing to get them to fork out sort of $50,000 in that case and so we
changed the model to one where we take care of the ﬁnancing and then it is a much
simpler approach. And we say, look, what is your utility bill and with no money down,
after the solar system is installed, your electricity bill -- your total cost of electricity
goes down every month. So essentially you get more money in your pocket every
month just by installing solar and you have the environmental beneﬁts as well. And
that was vastly more appealing to people even though it was essentially the same
product at the end of the day.
So in that case, SolarCity worked with a number of banks, including US Bank, to
provide that to people in a very seamless way and the Company's growth took oﬀ in
a tremendous way. We increased sales several fold. So it was very positive.
I think going to the net worth question, well, I mean if you went to look at some of
the assessments that are out there by Forbes or Fortune or whatever, they are, I
suppose, not too far oﬀ. So there is certainly signiﬁcant assets besides Tesla from
which I can cover the guarantee that I am making and that is what I mean when I say I
am putting my money where my mouth is to say that no matter what happens,
people should feel conﬁdent that the residual value of their car will remain what we
are committing to here. And I am essentially making myself personally liable for that
because I believe so strongly in the quality of the product and the long-term value of
the Model S.
Didn't Forbes say $11 billion?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
If they did say $11 billion, they are being a bit too generous. I am not familiar with that
number. That sounds a bit high. Any last questions there?
No. I think that is it.

Sure. Well for our ﬁnancing product, we are expecting a pretty high percentage. I
would say probably a majority of our customers will end up taking this approach.
That is what I would recommend as the way to go for customers and I am guessing
probably at least half, maybe more. Sorry, this is with respect to the US and we will
be trying to ﬁgure out something for Canada as well and then Europe and Asia as we
get to those markets.

don't have a demand problem and we expect to sell about as many cars as we can

to put out this volume of cars?

Phil LeBeau, CNBC.
A quick question, you mentioned that you are personally standing behind this oﬀer.
Is that some kind of a guarantee separate from your word? In other words, a ﬁnancial
guarantee that if somebody says to you, listen, I am not happy after three years. I
know you have the guarantee in there in terms of the residual value being equal to
the S class. But is there something more behind that wording?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
No. I mean I think -- I don't think I could express it more clearly, which is no matter
what happens to Tesla -- I mean obviously I think Tesla is going to have a very bright
future. But there are some people out there who I think are pessimistic for reasons I
don't entirely understand. And even in that circumstance, I will stand by the residual
value if Tesla cannot with all of the assets at my disposal.
Thank you.
Mark Rogowski, Forbes.
What is the residual value on an S class right now after three years?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. According to the Automotive Leasing Guide, which is the sort of industry
authority on leasing residual values, it is currently 43% after three years.
Okay. And you mentioned a ﬁve-year loan. But --.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Just to be clear, if you take the -- at the risk of being overly precise -- essentially if
you take the trailing 12 months and average the trailing 12 months for a Mercedes
S550, in Automotive Leasing Guide, which is the industry standard guide, it is 43%.
Sorry to be overly -- that may be too much detail. But anyway.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

Q - David BakerNo problem. Precision is good. And you mentioned a ﬁve-year lease. But the
example on the Web calculator uses a 66-month model. So that seems to be 5.5
years if we are being precise. So is that the actual loan term that we are sort of
working with or does it really depend on what you negotiate with the bank?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
This particular oﬀering is a 66-month oﬀering. So however, you get to give us the car
back after 36 months. So it's essentially -- we are taking, like I said, the best elements
of a lease, which is the ability to just return a car after three years with no hassle and
(inaudible) ﬁnancing and so it is a 5.5 year loan, after which you would have paid oﬀ
all the principal. However, at the three-year point, you can just say, hey, I want to get
a new Model S or I want to get a diﬀerent car and you can just give us back the car
and be done with it.
And do you guys think that if the cars are worth more at that point, you would be
willing to pay more for them or are you not looking that far ahead yet? In other
words, let's say the car is worth 50% of the price paid. So it is worth $40,000 instead
of $30,000, will you help people capture that value or are they going to have to go
private party to do that?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We will. If the residual value is higher than that and we think it will, we will pay the
market rate.
Okay.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. So it should be thought of as no less than.
Thank you.

beginning and use someone in California as an example in terms of the state and
federal incentives that are available here. I am a California customer, I am interestedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

Q - Jacob Brown
A - Elon Muskin going with this model. Do I actually have to put any money down, how exactly
does this work?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. And I encourage people to go and check it out on our website, which has gone
live and has sort of the calculator and sort of ﬁgure it all out. But essentially, in
California, you get, in addition to the $7,500 federal tax credit, there is a $2500 state
tax credit and several other states also have a state credit. So let's say you bought a
Model S, including options, that was $70,000 or something like that. Then you would
have the -- the tax credits in California would amount to -- state and federal would
amount to $10,000.
So you would have $3000 left over from the tax credits and then I'm not sure what
the exact monthly payment would be for a vehicle like that. But I think it would be
something in the sort of $500 or $600 a month range. It could actually be a fair bit
less than that depending upon how you value your time or how much gasoline you
use because we are talking about net out-of-pocket, which is I think really what
matters to consumers and so it works out I think really well. I mean you could
essentially own a Model S for no money down net of the tax credits and around
$500 or $600 a month in California.
{BIO 20814600 <GO>}
You would still be putting money down though because the tax credits only come at
a particular time, right? I mean you still have to front the money, don't you?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. It is -- there is some time delay, which can vary from three months to a year sort
of thing depending upon when you buy the car versus when tax time is. But actually I
think the California one is immediate. Sorry, the California one is immediate. The
federal one is at tax time.

Got it. Thanks.

I was just wondering what you meant by you were personally guaranteeing the value
of the car and basically -- yes, that was pretty much my big question. How are you
guaranteeing it? And how can you make that kind of promise?

Q - Jacob BrownYes. So essentially Tesla is sort of the ﬁrst backstop on the guarantee. So Tesla is
essentially saying that the value will be proportionate to that of a really awesome car,
which is the Mercedes S class and then for those who still have any doubt remaining,
worst-case scenario, because I know there are some people out there who are still
quite pessimistic about the future of electric cars and Tesla, I mean I think that is
increasingly changing, at least with respect to Tesla, that perception. But nonetheless
to give people complete peace of mind, I am personally standing behind that
residual value. So even if Tesla isn't able to honor it, I will personally do so.
{BIO 4089786 <GO>}
Okay. So you are willing to put your own money into it or your own investments into
it to guarantee that, for some odd reason, if electric our values tank in the next ﬁve
years that nobody is going to be on the hook about it?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Exactly.
{BIO 4089786 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
That is what I mean by putting my money where my mouth is. And obviously I feel
very conﬁdent about the future. In fact, I think residual values are going to be
excellent and what we have seen with the Tesla Roadster, which is our ﬁrst product, is
that we have seen very good residual values. And so we do have some conﬁdence
as a function of what we have seen there.
{BIO 4089786 <GO>}
Okay. Then if the customer doesn't want to give the car back and for some odd
reason -- or if the value of the car completely inﬂates because everybody wants a
Model S, you are telling me that you don't have to give the car back for the 43% of
the residual value?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
That is exactly right. And that is part of what I mean by combining the best elements
of ﬁnancing and leasing or ownership and leasing is you, as the consumer, have the
right, you have the right but not the obligation to give the car back for a particular
amount. So it is your car and so it is a one-way thing that's in the favor of the
consumer and we are trying to construct essentially the most consumer-friendly
ﬁnancing product in existence. That is our goal here and yes.
{BIO 4089786 <GO>}
Okay. Then, I'm sorry, one last question, is there any way to ﬁnd out how good your
credit has to be to get this kind of ﬁnancing?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

I think the banks are sort of sensitive to these requirements. You have to have a good
credit rating. But what we have seen is a pretty substantial percentage, a super
majority of our customers that have applied have been approved. So I think most
people who apply will be approved for the best outcome and then in some cases,
they might say, okay, well, there needs to be a slightly higher down payment or
something like that and we are going to keep working with the banks to make them
increasingly accountable over time to increase the approval rating. But what we have
seen thus far, because we have been running this as kind of a -- sort of a -- I wouldn't
say a secret. But as sort of a quiet trial program. In our quiet sort of trial program, we
have seen a super majority of people accepted in the sort of (multiple speakers).

working with a few other banks. Actually I can give you a tiny point of trivia. I actually
once did a summer internship for the Chairman's oﬃce of the Bank of Nova Scotia in
Toronto about a zillion years ago. So I don't know if any of the guys there remember
me. But --.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

It was a very interesting time. So I -- I worked for a guy by the name of Peter
Nicholson at the time. He went on to be the Chief Economic Adviser of Canada. He
was a great guy. Anyway, keep going. The larger point is that we are going to work
with Scotiabank and others to bring this to Canada really, really soon. Yes. As soon as
we can manage, hopefully within a matter of a few months.

And I don't want to cut this oﬀ. But we are running out of time. So we are just going
to take one more question.
Matt DeBord, Southern California Public Radio.
Hi, Elon, let me keep it short. You guys aren't currently doing any of your own
ﬁnancing, right? I should probably know this. But is that the case?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. We do not have like a captive ﬁnance arm like the big car companies. So yes, we
don't have that.
Do you anticipate that in the future given you may have taken the ﬁrst step toward
that by putting your considerable net worth behind this deal?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think we could see something like that in the future. It won't be in the near term. But
it could be there in the long term. Right now, the cost of ﬁnancing from the big
banks is incredibly competitive. So it is not something that we could I think match
with an internal system in the near term. But maybe in the long term.
And lastly, is there a reason why you don't understand the pessimism out there even
though it may be meager in nature?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well I could probably hazard some guesses. I mean generally the nature of the
pessimism doesn't seem to be based on fundamentals. But more on the idea that
while there hasn't been a new car company startup that was successful since
Chrysler and that was 90 years ago. But generally when people come and do theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

Operatordue diligence and actually visit our factory and see the cars being made or talk to
customers or drive our car, as soon as they appreciate the actual product and really
do the research on the fundamentals of the Company, then that seems to have quite
a profound eﬀect and really changes their perception substantially. So we try to
encourage people to do that as often as possible.
Okay. Thanks.
