Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Durga Doraisamy, Vice President of Investor
Relations. And I'd like to welcome you to Starbucks 2020 Investor Day.
A couple of housekeeping items before we get started. First, I would like to assure
you that Starbucks has followed all applicable safety requirements set forth by the
Center for Disease Control and state and local authorities to help ensure the health
of our partners and production crews, who have contributed to the production of
today's event. Secondly, please take a moment to review the slides shown here as
we will be making a number of forward-looking statements, throughout today'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Good afternoon from Seattle, Washington, and thank you all for joining us today.
It is my pleasure to welcome you to Starbucks 2020 Investor Day. Now I'm speaking
with you today from our Starbucks Reserve store located on the ground ﬂoor of the
Starbucks Support Center here in Seattle. And as we did two years ago with this
event in New York, Michelle Burns, our Head of Global Coﬀee, will kick oﬀ today's
meeting with a coﬀee tasting. Sharing coﬀee together is a ritual for us, a ritual that is
just as powerful during these times as we all long for human connection and shared
experiences. As part of the virtual leadership experience here at Starbucks, Michelle
recently connected over coﬀee with many of our partners from the hillside of a
beautiful volcano, surrounded by coﬀee trees at Hacienda Alsacia in Costa Rica. Take
a look.
(Video Presentation)
We host an Investor Day every two years. And a lot has happened since 2018 when
we outlined our growth at scale agenda. Today, we look to update you on how our
strategy is working and our belief that Starbucks is stronger and more resilient than
ever. Over the past two years, we have further streamlined the company, sharpened
our focus on the two lead growth markets of the US and China, expanded our global
reach through the global coﬀee alliance with Nestle, enhanced our digital platform
and delivery capabilities and fundamentally transformed the way we drive
innovation. And we adapt as we build and strengthen the Starbucks Coﬀee
Company. As a result, we've created signiﬁcant value for all stakeholders, and we
remain committed to doing so as we look to the future.
Now from the ﬁrst day I stepped into the CEO role at Starbucks, I have held a strong
belief that the leadership team and I share an important responsibility. The
responsibility to have the wisdom, to know what to honor and preserve from the
past, while at the same time boldly re-imagining the future. If we fail to honor and
preserve the purpose-driven nature of Starbucks, the culture that built this great
company or our passion for coﬀee and the central role it plays in what we stand for,
we will lose our way. Likewise, if we fail to re-imagine our business and constantly
adapt in ways that are relevant to our customers' inspiring to our partners and
meaningful to our business, we will lose our competitive edge.
Recent events have only accelerated the pace at which these changes are
happening. Our customers are increasingly looking for options that prioritize health
and well-being, as well as eﬀortless experiences. Experiences delivered how
customers want them, whether that be in our stores, conveniently on-the-go orFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 36delivered to wherever they are. So we will continue to evolve to remain relevant,
innovating and adapting are not optional. And as stakeholders, you should all feel a
great sense of comfort in knowing that we understand this balance and that is how
we run our business each and every day. And since our last Investor Day in
December 2018, Starbucks has delivered 50% in total shareholder returns, and we
have seen an increase in our equity market cap of roughly $30 billion.
I am proud of Starbucks partners and how they have worked together to deliver
these results. Together, over the past two years, we have taken the company to a new
level of capability and performance across almost every dimension, I can think of.
What is even more amazing is that we accomplished all of this, while navigating a
pandemic that has aﬀected every part of the world in the past year. And it's
important to recognize that at Starbucks creating value begins with our partners and
that is why we continue to invest in them through increased wages, new beneﬁts,
enhanced technology and the unprecedented COVID-19 relief support we provided
earlier this year. And I'm proud of my Starbucks partners as we are now seeing
partner customer connection at higher levels than prior years. I don't think today
should be overly focused on the pandemic. After all, we have many
accomplishments and long-term plans to discuss that will outlast this public health
challenge.
And so there are three takeaways for today I'd like you to keep in mind. First, over
the past two years, our growth at scale agenda has sharpened our focus, enabled
disciplined execution, enhanced our ability to allocate capital to its highest and best
uses and unleashed a growth mindset throughout Starbucks. Our growth at scale
agenda is working. Second, we've rapidly adapted to a changing environment. And
as a result, we have achieved a new level of resilience at Starbucks and strengthened
our competitive position. And third, we already have line of sight to an innovation
agenda that positions Starbucks for the next phase of growth. We are well
positioned for the future.
And today, you will hear from several of our leaders, joining from diﬀerent Starbucks
locations, including Roz Brewer, John Culver, Michael Conway, and Pat Grismer, who
will proudly share our strategies and vision for the future. We will then open the
session to take your questions.
So with that, let me begin by framing the size of the opportunity and establishing
some foundational principles of our strategy. The coﬀee market remains a very
attractive category. It is large and growing, and we're focused on growing category
share. Euromonitor sized the coﬀee addressable market at roughly $360 billion of
revenue globally in 2019. And they expect that to grow at a CAGR of 5% to 6%
through 2023. Now that would place the coﬀee addressable market at roughly $450
billion of revenue globally in 2023. Now the global pandemic certainly created
disruption in 2020, but based on our view of the overall market recovery and our
outlook, we agree with the expectation that the coﬀee market will reach this level
over the next three years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 36We also believe businesses like ours that adapt rapidly to changing consumer
preferences and behaviors will grow much faster than the market. As a premium and
highly diﬀerentiated brand, our ability to grow share in this large and growing coﬀee
market is at the core of our unwavering optimism about the future of Starbucks.
Now this image illustrates how we think about the coﬀee addressable market.
Internally, we refer to it as the honeycomb slide. For each of the outer cells at this
honeycomb, we have clarity on where we stand in terms of revenue and share,
Starbucks' role in the ecosystem and where our growth will come from in the future.
We also have a clear strategy for each element of this model. The most important of
which is specialty coﬀee retail. Not only does it have the largest addressable market,
but strategically it is where we both establish and build the Starbucks brand. With
nearly 33,000 stores globally serving over 100 million customer occasions a week
pre-pandemic, we bring unparalleled scale to create a diﬀerentiated premium
experience for our customers. And that experience reinforces the Starbucks brand
and none of our competitors are able to match it.
Now, two years ago, we deﬁned a very clear brand promise that we use internally to
empower innovation in ways that elevate the customer experience, drive new and
relevant beverage platforms and expand digital customer relationships. That formula
has proven to drive growth over the past two years and is also enabling our recovery.
Our proven ability to adapt quickly, leaves us even more conﬁdent than ever that we
can continue to create value for all stakeholders over the long term no matter what
form the economic recovery takes. We then leverage ﬂagship retail to amplify the
brand, the six ﬂagship roasteries, all located in iconic cities around the world serve
that purpose. They are brand ampliﬁers and hubs of innovation.
The rest of the outer cells on the honeycomb mainly focus on at home and at oﬃce
coﬀee. Through relationships with world-class companies like Nestle and PepsiCo,
our strategy is to grow our category share in these channels, while amplifying the
brand globally. The global coﬀee alliance with Nestle has been a powerful
partnership that expanded our reach to 62 markets over the past 24 months. In
addition, bringing Starbucks onto the Nespresso platform has created a win-win
opportunity for both Starbucks and Nestle as we continue to see growth in single-
serve coﬀee experiences at home and in the oﬃce.
So when you think about the coﬀee addressable market, remember this, it is a large
and growing market that Euromonitor predicts to grow about 25% by 2024 and to
capitalize on this opportunity, Starbucks will continue to build the brand in specialty
coﬀee retail, amplify the brand through ﬂagship retail and expand to more markets
and more channels as we grow category share.
Now as we look to the future, it's important to understand how the recent disruption
of the pandemic has accelerated certain changes in consumer behavior and how
Starbucks is well positioned to further diﬀerentiate the Starbucks experience and
better serve our customers. We believe many of these changes are here to stay, and
we will continue to adapt our business accordingly to ensure we are meeting our
customers how and where they want to engage with Starbucks. Through theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 36relationships we have with our customers around the world, we are focusing on ﬁve
shifts in consumer behavior to guide us as we adapt in ways that we expect will
extend our market leadership position globally.
First, customers will continue to have a fundamental need to be seen and experience
a feeling of connection to others, human connection. This feeling has long been the
bedrock of community. While deep strong connections can be formed through
digital relationships, there is a distinct and natural ease to in-person experiences that
are important, even among our younger generation of customers.
A Starbucks partner saying hello and oﬀering a smile to a customer as they pick up a
mobile order that was personally handcrafted just for them. It provides that small,
but powerful human interaction we all crave. In fact, former US Surgeon General,
Vivek Murthy, recently described the pandemic as creating a social recession,
supporting our prediction that people will seek out these community connection
experiences as a vaccine is distributed. And I believe Starbucks will be a top
destination to facilitate social healing through human connection.
Second, customers will continue to seek experiences that eﬀortlessly ﬁt their lifestyle.
In many ways, that means more convenient on demand experiences with curated
options. And Starbucks is focused on meeting customers where they are. That might
mean choosing a favorite order on your mobile app as you pass through a Starbucks
pickup store or having your barista, greet you by name with your customer order at
the drive through or curbside. Customers are looking for more eﬀortless experiences
both in store as well as digitally, and we will provide innovation to oﬀer experiences
personally designed to meet customers where they are, both geographically and
emotionally.
Third, customers will continue to look for consistent experiences. Starbucks has long
been a leader on this dimension. We are key part of people's everyday life in a way
that few companies are at a global scale. We will elevate our attention on being that
dependable third place that oﬀers a consistent, familiar and premium experience in
each and every store around the world.
Fourth, customers are seeking high quality and sustainable products that support the
well-being of people and the planet. Customers want the best tasting, highest
quality arabica coﬀee, but that's not enough. They want to know that their coﬀee is
ethically sourced and supports the betterment of people and the planet. So in
addition to continuing to source the ﬁnest beans from skilled farmers around the
world and innovating around beverage platforms, both hot and cold, we will further
elevate plant based beverage and food options that resonate with our customers.
Finally, we know now more than ever customers are increasingly loyal to brands with
strong values. People around the world are increasingly taking into account what a
brand stands for when they buy a product. What is its purpose? What is the culture?
And how does that guide them in their purchasing decisions? For Starbucks, we will
continue to be purpose driven, guided by our mission and values in how we showFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 36up for all stakeholders on issues important to our communities. These ﬁve consumer
behaviors are not new, but they are emerging stronger and are ampliﬁed in the
current environment. And Starbucks is uniquely positioned to lean into and beneﬁt
from these changes in customer behavior. And we see a clear path to modernize and
sharpen our approach in ways that strengthen our leadership advantage. And we will
continue to meet customers on their terms, as Roz and John will describe here in a
minute.
Now, the past two years have made Starbucks an even better company, and I believe
that is in large part because we have stayed true to our mission and values. This has
served us well. Starbucks is stronger and more resilient than ever as we approach
our 50th anniversary, a milestone that will provide a natural opportunity to reﬂect on
our history and look to the future. Since the very beginning, we've been a company
focused on caring for our partners, creating uplifting experiences for our customers
and playing a positive role in our communities and throughout society.
This year has taught us that moving forward we can and will elevate our commitment
to serve all stakeholders. In January of this year, we evolved our sustainability
agenda to play a more central role in our company strategy, we call this planet
positive. Not only did we conduct comprehensive audits of our carbon, water and
waste impacts in order to establish targets for 2030 to reduce them by 50%, we
articulated an aspiration to become a resource positive company, meaning that we
aspire to give back more than we take from the planet. Planet positive strategies and
initiatives align with our core business and it all starts with how we source the ﬁnest
arabica coﬀee beans from around the world.
As we shift to more plant-based oﬀerings and ﬁnd solutions for more sustainable
dairy, we are directly addressing customer preferences. And over the coming years,
you will see us doing even more, like making deeper investments in renewable
energy, reducing water consumption through new coﬀee processing techniques,
increasing our support of more environmentally responsible dairy and further
adding to our plant-based menu. Our planet positive agenda is a multi-decade
aspiration. And we are doing this in a very intentional, transparent and accountable
way.
In addition to our planet positive agenda, we have sharpened our focus in support
of our people positive agenda. That means making a positive diﬀerence for partners,
customers and society around three core areas; inclusion, opportunity and
community. When it comes to inclusion, we aim to lead by example and embrace a
set of actions that don't just create a warm welcoming experience for all who visit
our stores, but also a more inclusive, diverse and equitable work experience at every
level within Starbucks. And I'm proud that over the past three years, we have
achieved and maintained pay equity for both gender and race in the US. And we're
going beyond that by establishing inclusion and diversity commitments and goals
and linking them directly to executive compensation.
I'm also proud of how we've created opportunity through programs, such as
Starbucks College Achievement Plan in partnership with Arizona State University,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 36where we now have over 17,000 Starbucks partners participating in ASU's online
college degree program and nearly 5,000 graduates, we have hired over 30,000
military veterans and spouses, and we are on a run rate of hiring 5,000 each year
going forward. And yet, we can do more to put these kinds of initiatives front and
center at Starbucks.
In support of coﬀee farmers, we've provided nearly 50 million coﬀee trees that are
resistant to coﬀee rust diseases. We are expanding our network for farmer support
centers to 10 around the world. We are supporting coﬀee farmers through an
additional $50 million investment in the Global Farmer Fund, providing access to
capital so farmers can strengthen their farms through coﬀee tree renovation and
infrastructure improvements. And we are leveraging our agronomy research to help
farmers around the world improve both the quality and yield of coﬀee from their
farms. By doing this, we also improve the economic prosperity of these farming
families.
And ﬁnally, our focus on community is reinforced by our continued work on national
priorities, such as food and security. While the Starbucks Foundation is also making
micro grants to nonproﬁts at the store level, where our store partners are actively
engaged in community service. Like many companies, we are aggressively
positioning our business for growth at scale. But unlike others, we also extend that
same sense of purpose to being both planet and people positive. This approach
acknowledges our aspiration as a publicly traded for-proﬁt business to have a
positive social impact for all stakeholders. And as Pat will share with you later today,
we will do all of this while in pursuit of proﬁtable growth and creating even more
value for our shareholders.
So when you put this all together, Starbucks is stronger and more resilient than ever.
We have a long runway of healthy growth ahead and are well positioned to invest in
the right areas to strengthen our competitive advantage and drive consistent,
sustainable growth for many years to come. And we do all of this, staying true to the
mission and values that built this great company. With Starbucks partners at the core,
we've embraced an agenda of people, planet and proﬁt that we believe will create
signiﬁcant value for all stakeholders.
And I want to thank you for joining us today. But before I close, I want to comment
on today's announcement that our Starbucks Board Chair, Mike Ullman, who has
served on our Board for the past 18 years, will retire from this post eﬀective March
2021. Mike will be succeeded by Mellody Hobson, who has served our Starbucks
Board of Directors since 2005 and is currently our Vice Chair. We are very fortunate
to have a world-class board, and I want to take a moment just to acknowledge Mike
and thank him for all he has contributed in support of Starbucks, our Board and the
leadership team. He has been a great partner to me, and I'm very grateful for his
service.
I also want to congratulate Mellody on her appointment to Board Chair. She is a very
talented leader and a great supporter of Starbucks. We are fortunate to have her
step into this new role. And I'm excited about my partnership with Mellody and theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

Oﬃcer and Group President for the Americas, who joins us from a beautiful

(Video Presentation)
Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everyone.
Wow, when I look back at that footage from our Chicago leadership experience a
year ago, bringing together 12,000 of our US and Canada retail leaders, I don't think
any of us could have imagined how much our business and our world would change.
And while 2020 has been deﬁned by uncertainty, what remains constant, what you
see and feel from that short video is the pie and the passion so deeply innate in our
Starbucks partners. It makes me think about the amazing legacy of our founder,
Howard Schultz and how he set the tempo for humble partners, serving customers in
the absolute best way possible. It's just so human and so necessary in today's world.
Now, here is something very special about the Starbucks experience, it's about the
connection we have with our customers, a connection that's a little bit comfort,
sprinkled with a little bit of stardust. Our business will always evolve and shift. There
is no doubt about that. But we remain committed to the core of who we are and
what drives our success and that's our partners.
Starbucks has a proven track record of growth. But if there is one thing I hope you
take away today, it's opportunity. The enormous opportunity we have with our
customers as we feel the next era of growth for Starbucks, an era powered by the
relationships we have today. And those will deepen and create as we continue to
diﬀerentiate through expanded digital connections, innovative beverage oﬀerings
and elevated customer experiences. For nearly 50 years, coﬀee and connection have
been at the core of our brand, the strength of which is reﬂected in our relationships
with our customers and the products we oﬀer.
In normal times, our daily routine comforts us. In uncertain times, we crave the
predictability the rituals and routines provide us. Think about it. Most of us slip on
the same shoe ﬁrst every day. We don't even have to think about it in the morning.
Our daily routine is comforting. As a company, we made a deliberate choice to
pause service when the pandemic began. Quarantine restrictions disrupted the
routines of so many of our customers and our partners, but pausing was the right
choice. A choice rooted in prioritizing the health and well-being of our partners and
customers. And now that we've resumed operations, our customers and our partners
are real to be together again, perhaps even more so now that connection hasFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 36become increasingly limited and, therefore, so much more pressures in our everyday
lives.
So rather through our app or in person is the connections we form with our
customers that keeps them coming back. Just look at these comments, they remind
me every single day of the importance of Starbucks in our customers' lives. We never
take that for granted and the results are clear. Customer connection scores continue
to trend well above prior year, which we believe leads to comp growth. This is a win-
win for both our customers and our business and for that, we are extremely proud is
that connection, that ability to deepen existing relationships, while creating new
ones we see is our greatest opportunity for growth.
At the end of Q4, Starbucks had 19.3 million 90-day active members in its digital
ecosystem. And it's these customers who drive nearly 50% of our revenue with close
to one in every four transactions coming from mobile order and pay. Yet our
addressable customer base those customers who already know our brand and visit
us is closer to approximately 75 million. That kind of opportunity is seductive and
rightfully, we have high ambitions for growth in our Rewards program. We're already
seeing strong new membership, resulting from our stars for everyone enhancements
that gives members more ways to pay and earn stars, building on the outstanding
momentum we have with our digital ﬂywheel. As more customers adopt our app and
reap the rewards, we fully expect higher levels of engagement going forward. This
makes us incredibly optimistic about member growth for ﬁscal 2021 and beyond.
Now let me demonstrate how we are going beyond our app to bring value to
customers. You see here, when I pull up to the drive through, our proprietary AI
engine serves up production suggestions speciﬁc to the store, to the weather, to the
time of day and available inventory.
(Video Presentation)
Starbucks knows what customers like me at this store, in this moment will most likely
order. And we're just getting started. In the future, customers will receive even more
suggestions like how to make their drinks perfect for them and recommendations
that help us manage inventory and improve speed of service, leaving more time for
our baristas to do what they do best, connect with customers. There is my dream,
ready and leaving, just the way I like it. This is where art and science come together
so perfectly. Using the stores information allows us to tailor what's shown to the
customer in the moment, increasing the likelihood of purchase, making their perfect
order just one tap, gesture or freeze away and driving growth in the way that only
Starbucks can authentically deliver.
So the more we leverage AI and deepen our digital relationships, the more we can
drive frequency. And as we bring more customers into our digital ecosystem,
leveraging that base of approximately $75 million, who know and frequent us today,
we have a golden opportunity to architect experiences to surprise and delight ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 10 of 36customers, existing and new. Just imagine our opportunity ahead. The experiential
aspect of our brand also extends to beverage, another key point of diﬀerentiation.
As new trends come into play in customers' attitudes and behaviors evolve, AI has
helped to deepen our connection with them, allowing exploration of new beverages,
particularly with our cold platform. Cold has grown by nearly 45% the past four
years. So for Starbucks, cold is hot. Likewise, as customers redeﬁne health and
wellness, we're continuing to innovate with non-dairy options. We started blending
lattes with soymilk more than 20 years ago, adding coconut milk, almond milk and
oat milk options regionally along the way.
And by simply changing the dairy option, asking for sugar-free serves, or removing
whip cream, customers can decide the ingredient and calorie content of their
favorite beverages. At the same time, we're testing delicious low and no sugar
platforms, along with the ability to completely customize beverages, allowing the
level of sweetness that ﬁts every customer's individual taste. Of course, beverages
also drive routine and that routine drives loyalty. Our 90-day active reward members
in ﬁscal 2020 grew more than 10% year-over-year. So the program is attracting more
occasional customers, which creates signiﬁcant opportunity because we know when
customers join the Starbucks Rewards program, there is a meaningful uptick in their
total spend.
Here is a sneak peek at one of our newest innovations launching nationally this
spring, shaken iced espresso. Inspired by our roastery menu, we combined our high
quality espresso, brown sugar, oat milk and shake into a smooth beverage ﬁnish. It
speaks to how we're meeting the generational shift in customers taste, while
addressing the needs of the health conscious. A segment representing 26% of
customers and climate. Millennials and Gen Zers under 30 are 2 times more likely to
drink cold coﬀee, that's pretty news as cold beverages had driven more than $1
billion in sales over the past three years. And just like the rest of our cold platform,
we believe this new drink will resonate all year across all dayparts, next to working
behind the bar with our partners. Beverage innovation is one of the best parts of my
job, because I get enough close seat to yet another way we're bringing art and
science together to delight customers. And I have to say it's just a lot of fun. Thank
you.. This one's mine, but you can get yours in the spring.
Now as customers' routines continue to evolve, our ability to have the right store in
the right place at the right time is yet another a central aspect of deepening and
developing relationships. And as this dynamic behavior that drives innovation in our
continued development of new stores, there is no better way to meet our customers
where they are, than through our impressive store growth strategy. We expect our
US stores will expand by nearly 800 gross new stores each year, supporting our
long-term growth model. Though we are growing oﬀ a large base, there is ample
room to expand in regions, where the Starbucks brand is less penetrated with
particular focus on high-volume, high margin, suburban drive throughs.
With the brand and customer always up the center, we will evolve and strengthen
our portfolio as we accelerate new formats like pickup and curbside to improveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 11 of 36proﬁtability and increase convenience. We refer to this as trade area transformation
and it's a critical component of our new store strategy. We expect that pickup and
other new formats combined with proven successful formats like drive through will
expand to nearly 45% of our US portfolio by 2023, up almost 10% from ﬁscal 2020.
As we continue to evolve our portfolio, store growth remains as important as ever.
Pre-COVID, roughly 80% of our sales were to go. Since opening our ﬁrst Starbucks
pickup just over a year ago, we're accelerating this format in others focused on
convenience across the US. We know the same Starbucks customer has diﬀerent
experiences, depending on where they are in their day, and we're supplementing
our traditional cafes to oﬀer a range of formats, the best cater to their needs.
For example, a lot of professionals who work in cities also live in cities, and we may
beneﬁt with the location closer to their home than their oﬃce in a commercial
district. We're also seeing suburban drive throughs cater to people working from
home who visit us for a break in their day. As we introduce more eﬃcient formats,
we're reducing the long lines that can sometimes occur in metro locations, unlocking
more sales. And since these are smaller stores without seating areas, this enhances
our ﬁts house proﬁle, which further contributes to improved margin.
Based on how customers respond to these new formats in terms of visitation and
frequency, we'll harness our extraordinary data analytics to rapidly learn and adapt
as we go. As we elevate convenience and connection, we must also optimize the
operating system within our stores and continue reducing complexity to make it
easier for partners to serve customers. Work is under way to accelerate throughput
in our stores, speciﬁcally drive throughs and enhance our service experience by
simplifying product builds and investing in equipment like new warming events,
freeing up partners to focus on customers.
We also continue to push the envelope of innovation in coﬀee leadership with
examples like our award winning Phantom brewer. The Phantom deﬁnes what's
possible, while adding to the theater of experience. It presents a choice of four
espresso oﬀerings and removes the barrier of a large box, allowing customers to
enjoy the brewing process with their barista. As we radically shift the burden of the
administrative and production tasks to machine learning and technology will unlock
a more productive and meaningful use of labor. This is a win far our partners, our
customers and our business. Some might call it hitting a triple.
So here's what I hope you take away. Starbucks has incredible opportunity, an
enviable lot of assets that we are building upon, we have passionate, talented and
loyal partners, partners who've been with the company on average of nearly three
years, a lifetime in retail industry put the company on the cusp of celebrating its 50th
anniversary. They believe this company is great can be even greater and want to be
part of this next era of growth. Our technology is proven within this industry and
across the world, our brand is known. We have a huge addressable market that has
yet to be tapped. And we're moving very fast. Of course, there's still a lot of work
ahead, but the vision is clear. And our path forward is ﬁlled with opportunity. Our
customers are relying on us to be there for them whenever, however, because weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

Thank you, Roz, and good afternoon to everyone who is joining us on the call.
Today, in international, we operate more than 15,000 stores across 81 diﬀerent
markets. And our expansion around the world continues to accelerate and nowhere
is that more evident than in China. Let me begin there and share our plans for this
strategic market. First, I want to start by recognizing the resilience we've
demonstrated in China. Guided by our mission and values, the China leadership
team prioritize partners as the pandemic emerged, putting their health and safety
ﬁrst and foremost. The decisions that they made during this time represent the
values of this company in action front and center. Our partners continue to play an
active role and inspiring each other and creating safe and familiar experiences for
our customers. Our partners truly are the heartbeat of Starbucks, and we would not
be where we are today without their passion, their pride and their commitment to
what the green apron represents. This past year has taught us a lot and it's pushed
us to become even more agile as we move to China speed to make decisions and
adapt to our changing customer needs.
Let me share a little bit about what life in China looks like today and how Starbucks
has responded. First, China has recovered quickly driven by holistic and calibrated
measures, which were led by local health authorities. China's economy has seen a
strong recovery, as consumer behaviors have returned to pre-pandemic levels and
retail sales has steadily grown since August. Recently, the Double Eleven, Singles'
Day event saw record-breaking engagement for participating brands, including
Starbucks.
Beyond consumer spending, China is returning to a normalized way of life. This was
clear from this year's National Day, when more than 600 million people chose to
travel domestically. For Starbucks, we remain the leader in the specialty coﬀee
industry and our Q4 results demonstrate the resiliency and the relevance of our
brand. Customers have returned to our stores, longing for the connection to the
third place and the Shanghai roastery is once again a top destination for our
customers. It's that connection and the response we are seeing that further
strengthens our conﬁdence that China will soon be fully recovered.
This past year has also helped us evolve and get smarter about how we will grow for
the future. What we have learned is that the core of the third place is an
environment, physical or digital, out of store or at home, where all people can feel
uplifted. It's a feeling that invites people in, is familiar yet fresh and makes them feel
comfortable to be themselves. Now, since we've reopened our stores, we'veFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 13 of 36adapted the third place to continue to deliver the Starbucks experience in
increasingly relevant and meaningful ways.
We previously shared with all of you our China purpose-driven growth agenda.
Today, I want to share the next phase of that agenda. Let me ﬁrst reaﬃrm that our
stores will continue to be a meaningful growth engine for us going forward. Despite
a brief pause and development earlier this year, we've re-accelerated and opened a
record 259 new stores in Q4. This ﬁscal year, we're committed to opening 600 new
stores, which is consistent with the guidance we have previously provided.
Now as we grow, we will stay disciplined to ensure that the experience is relevant
and that our new stores are generating the appropriate returns. We have a strong
core presence in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities and our plan is to continue to go deeper in
these cities by adding new innovative formats to include Reserve stores and
Starbucks Now concepts. Focusing on the opportunity we see with Starbucks Now,
over 10% of new stores this ﬁscal year will be this store format. Now beyond our new
concepts and our core cities, we will continue to expand into new cities, leveraging
what we have learned from within our existing store base. Combined, all of this gives
us great conﬁdence that we are on track to reach our goal to have 6,000 stores
across 230 cities by the end of ﬁscal year 2022.
Pivoting to digital, we've adapted and integrated the physical third place with the
digital space. Starbucks was one of the very ﬁrst retailers in China to implement an
elevated in-store and out-of-store experience, built on contactless payment, mobile
order and pay and delivery oﬀerings to meet the evolving needs of customers. And
yes, our customers have responded with overwhelming enthusiasm to the moves
we've made.
At the end of Q3, we had 10 million 90-day active members, and by the end of Q4,
we have reached a record 13.5 million active members across our 4,700 stores. Our
team in China has moved with speed and agility to grow and strengthen our digital
engagement. And the work they have done has enabled us to increase our digital
sales mix to 26% in the most recent quarter, more than double the prior year.
Equally, we are moving with speed to develop greater personalization capabilities to
meet our customers' evolving needs. Our strategy is very clear. And that is to work
with the very best companies in China to build the digital ecosystem. That is why we
work with powerhouses like Alibaba, Tencent and Sequoia Capital's portfolio of
companies to help us accelerate and transform for the future.
Now Starbucks has always been in the people business serving coﬀee and our
investments in digital will enable us to connect with more customers in deeper and
more meaningful ways. Our aspiration is very clear and that is to be the leading
human-centered retailer, powered by technology across this strategic market. Now
more than ever, our success in China has been enabled by our ability to focus our
eﬀorts and rapidly innovate. A few examples of our innovation strength include our
plant-based GOOD GOOD menu, the very ﬁrst of its kind to scale in the market, ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

Page 14 of 36Michael Conwaytea cloud platform, a modern twist on the local tea culture and digital social gifting,
allowing customers connect through the gift of Starbucks.
Product innovation will continue to play a meaningful role in deﬁning our success as
we look to the future. Now we've operated in China for more than two decades. And
by investing in our partners and the communities we serve, we've been able to build
one of the most admired and respected companies. Throughout our history, we're
focused on building a healthy and sustainable specialty coﬀee industry, one that
creates jobs and contributes to China's growing coﬀee culture. Earlier this year, we
announced plans to invest $150 million to build the Starbucks Coﬀee Innovation
Park. Once completed, the Innovation Park will set the standard for our roasting and
manufacturing network and allow us to take a big step toward achieving our
company's planet positive goals.
And as we continue to invest in China, I'm pleased to announce that we've
established the Starbucks China Foundation in Beijing to transform lives and uplift
local communities. This further demonstrates our long-term commitment to China as
we build a diﬀerent type of company, one that makes a positive impact for others,
while using our scale for good.
Looking ahead, there is no other company better positioned than Starbucks to
capture additional market share and accelerate our growth over the long term.
Accelerated store growth, world-class digital experiences, sustainable innovation
and a company making a positive diﬀerence all of this is the China purpose-driven
growth agenda evolved.
Now we have truly been humbled by our success in China, and we understand that
success must be earned every day. And that it is deﬁned by the personal connection
our partners have with their customers and the passion and pride they demonstrate
in bringing the Starbucks experience to life. Our partners have been and will
continue to be what sets Starbucks apart and it is because of them that we have
never been more conﬁdent and more optimistic of the opportunity we have during
this next chapter of our China journey.
With that, I leave you with a very special message from our partners in China.

Now beyond China, an incredible opportunity remains for Starbucks across our
international markets. I'd like to introduce Michael Conway, a seven-year partner and
a member of my team, who oversees the growth and development of our nearly
10,000 international licensed stores. Michael, over to you.

Page 15 of 36The past 4 years since leading channel development has given me the opportunity
to see ﬁrst-hand how licensing work for Starbucks and to experience the passion of
our partners and their commitment to coﬀee in connection. And now, in my current
role, I'm using the unparallel power of our brand to drive and accelerate the growth
of Starbucks around the world. We are a global leader in licensing and are
committed to being world-class at providing holistic support for our licensed
business partners to drive growth in their markets.
Today, Starbucks serves customers in 83 markets across the globe. And what you
may not realize is that over 90% of those are operated as licensed markets. With our
business partners, we collectively operate nearly 10,000 stores and employ more
than 120,000 Starbucks partners who proudly wear the green apron. This means that
almost one in three Starbucks stores is an international licensed store and one in four
partners is employed by our licensees.
In nearly every region of the world, our business partners enable us to further extend
the global reach of the brand and deliver their premium Starbucks experience in a
consistent locally relevant way. This is possible because Starbucks worked with like-
minded business partners to expand the brand around the world. In fact, our top 10
international licensees represent over 90% of our stores and many of these
relationships span nearly 20 years. They have deep local knowledge of their
customers and they know how to navigate their marketplace. Importantly, they know
and are aligned with the Starbucks brand, our mission and our values. These
relationships remain strong and resilient today and will be an important contributor
to our continued success.
Our streamlined approach to international licensing has been key to focusing and
reinforcing our growth at scale agenda. This had allowed us to accelerate store
growth, extend our global reach and direct resources to our lead markets, the US
and China. This has also created an eﬃcient capital model with relatively higher
margins and return on invested capital. At the same time, there remains incredible
room for additional store growth in both existing and new markets as we work to
extend our brand presence and reach more customers around the world. We will
unlock this opportunity by focusing on our licensee economics and ensuring that the
Starbucks key success drivers are executed globally.
We recognize that for long-term success and investment in store growth, we must
continue to ensure that our economics are attractive to our business partners. Today,
we are in a strong position where our business model and retail proposition is one
that encourages our licensees to invest in critical growth enablers, like technology
and beautifully designed stores like the ones shown here.
With many other businesses are scaling down, our licensees are continuing to invest
in the Starbucks brand on the belief that Starbucks oﬀers one of the best
opportunities to proﬁtably grow their business. Importantly, these investments by
our licensees are ampliﬁed when directed towards Starbucks proven success drivers.
It starts with innovative beverage platforms that are tailored to the local market.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 16 of 36John CulverSuccess is also driven by the rollout of our digital ﬂywheel to create customer loyalty
through Starbucks Rewards and mobile ordering.
Today, we oﬀer the Starbucks Rewards program in nearly half of our international
markets and have more than 8 million members and counting. We plan to extend
our digital engagement even further through mobile payments and the ability to
order ahead using the Starbucks app. With mobile order and pay in only eight
international markets, including recent launches in India and Brazil, there remain
signiﬁcant room for expansion of this important platform to drive growth.
Finally, this all comes together in an elevated customer and store experience,
supported by driving clear global standards and operational excellence to deliver a
consistent Starbucks experience. As we look to the future, we expect the pace of
international licensed store development to return to our long-term growth
trajectory in ﬁscal 2022. And by 2023, we are poised to add nearly 2,000 additional
licensed stores to our global portfolio.
International licensing has unlocked tremendous success for Starbucks, and we're
extremely excited to continue building on a strong foundation in the years ahead.
United by common mission and vision, together with our licensees, we are
committed to delivering a premium experience to customers and taking a holistic
view of how we work together to grow the brand globally. This is growth at scale at
Starbucks.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Thank you, Michael.
Whether it's China, Japan or our licensed markets, these are the very early days of
our growth across our international business. Now let me shift to channel
development and the opportunity we see for growth beyond our retail stores. Let me
ﬁrst start with Nestle, where it has now been over two years since we came together
to form the Global Coﬀee Alliance. As I highlighted with all of you in New York, three
signiﬁcant opportunities exist with this partnership and the progress we have made
in a very short period of time has been extraordinary.
First, we quickly established the Starbucks brand on the Nespresso and Dolce Gusto
systems and now have 12 diﬀerent rows in cafe inspired ﬂavors, widely available
across these platforms. In North America, we further strengthened our leadership
position as the number one brand in the at-home coﬀee market, increasing our
share and growing our business 13% this past year. Internationally, we've expanded
into 62 markets, and we continue to see opportunity for future growth. Our
partnership with Nestle has been a huge springboard for Starbucks and what we
have seen has been the strength of two great companies coming together to rapidly
increase the presence of Starbucks around the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 17 of 36Patrick GrismerNow let me shift to our ready-to-drink business. As many of you are aware, we've had
a strong partnership with PepsiCo that has spanned 25 years. And together, we've
built Starbucks as the market leader for RTD coﬀee. Together, we've accelerated our
innovation pipeline and capitalized on the consumer trends we are seeing with iced
coﬀee. Our innovations include nitro and triple shot and have enabled us to further
expand our leadership position to become the number one RTD coﬀee brand
globally. This success has been driven by the growth we are seeing in the US
business and our expansion internationally.
In China, we established Starbucks as the premium segment leader with over 36%
volume growth in the last year. And in the EMEA region, we've grown our volume
nearly 25% over the past year. Given the success we are seeing across our entire RTD
portfolio, we will continue to invest in our partnerships and innovate as we look to
grow this business going forward.
Broadly, it's apparent that our customers have embraced the opportunity to engage
with Starbucks outside of our retail stores and as Kevin highlighted earlier, channel
development is the brand ampliﬁer, which will enable us to further strengthen our
leadership position and grow our overall share of the addressable coﬀee market.
In closing, over the last 50 years, our partners and our coﬀee have been at the center
of our success. By combining the strength of 400,000 passionate partners, our
nearly 33,000 retail stores and now more than 800,000 points of presence outside
of our stores, you are seeing the power and the relevance of Starbucks come to life.
Today, we are stronger, were bolder and our future has never ever been brighter.
Thank you. With that, we will take a brief ﬁve minute break and when we return, we
will be joined by Pat Grismer.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for the balance of our session today.
At our Investor Conference two years ago, I'd recently joined the company and
shared what had drawn me to Starbucks at the time, an iconic consumer brand. The
clear leader in an attractive growth category and even with its massive global reach,
a business with enormous growth potential. Today, as my fellow Starbucks partners
have shared, our growth at scale agenda is as compelling today as it was then. We
are increasingly diﬀerentiating Starbucks by catering to consumers in ways that they
prefer, providing a safe, familiar, eﬀortless and premium experience in our stores in
our drive through lanes, on-the-go or deliver to them wherever they are. And in that
context, I'm as optimistic as ever about our ongoing double-digit non-GAAP EPS
growth model with a stronger path over the next couple of years, as I'll explain later.
But ﬁrst, I want to highlight that even though we've already achieved signiﬁcant
global scale with nearly 33,000 stores across more than 80 markets, we've a long
runway of growth remaining. As the leader in premium coﬀee, we believe that we
will reach approximately 55,000 stores across 100 markets by the year 2030, a levelFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 18 of 36that is currently unmatched by any other single food and beverage retail concept
fueled by unparalleled brand appeal globally and strong unit level economics.
Two years ago, we articulated our double-digit growth model as at least 10% annual
growth of non-GAAP EPS. Today, we are updating our guidance to a range of 10% to
12% annual growth of non-GAAP EPS. Why? Because setting aside the impacts of
COVID-19, we've established a track record of executing our growth at scale agenda
with more consistent overall results, demonstrating sales growth and margin
improvement, and we're now in a position to guide to a more explicit range of non-
GAAP EPS growth with conﬁdence. When you add to this the approximately 2%
dividend yield we continue to project, this implies an annual total shareholder return
of approximately 12% to 14%, assuming a constant PE multiple, which, we believe,
represents a highly attractive investment opportunity for long-term growth oriented
investors.
The building blocks of our ongoing non-GAAP EPS growth model are unchanged
from what we introduced two years ago, comp growth for our company-operated
stores, unit growth and margin improvement, all underpinned by disciplined capital
allocation. As I share our expected ongoing growth rates, I want to clarify that these
growth rates generally apply to ﬁscal years 2023 and 2024, eﬀectively two and three
years beyond our current ﬁscal year. We've already guided to a signiﬁcant rebound
for ﬁscal 2021, as we lap the extreme impacts of COIVD-19 that we experienced in
ﬁscal 2020. And as I mentioned earlier and as I'll explain later, growth in ﬁscal 2022
will be outsized for certain metrics relative to our ongoing expectations as we lap
this year's recovery curve.
Let's start with comp growth. We're now expecting global comp growth of 4% to 5%
in ﬁscal 2023 and 2024. This represents a 1 percentage point improvement from our
previous growth model. Why? Because we are making signiﬁcant incremental
investments in our brand, principally to support our people positive and planet
positive agendas, as well as our industry-leading digital platforms. And we expect an
incremental return from these investments, supporting a higher ongoing level of
comp growth. This is led by our US business at 4% to 5% annual comp growth, a 1
percentage point increase from our previous model. For China, we also expect a 1
percentage point improvement in our outlook for annual comp growth with a new
range of 2% to 4%, reﬂecting our conﬁdence in delivering consistent results, while
continuing to open new stores at a rapid pace in our fastest growing market.
And speaking of store development, we are targeting global net store growth of
approximately 6% annually from ﬁscal 2022 to ﬁscal 2024. This is down slightly from
our previous range of 6% to 7%, reﬂecting our larger store base. For the US, we now
expect approximately 3% net unit growth annually, down slightly from our previous
range of 3% to 4% with the exception of ﬁscal 2021, which is only slightly positive
due to the impact of our trade area transformation initiatives. And for China, we
expect continued robust store development with a net unit growth rate in the low
teens, down modestly from our previous outlook of mid-teens growth,
acknowledging a rapidly expanding base of stores in our second lead growth
market.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 19 of 36Combining comp growth with unit growth, we expect enterprise revenue growth of
8% to 10% annually, up 1 percentage point from what we communicated two years
ago, driven by the additional comp growth that I outlined earlier. This includes 8% to
10% revenue growth of our retail business and 5% to 6% revenue growth of our
channel development business. Our outlook for channel development revenue
growth is 1 point higher on the low end compared to what we communicated in
2018, given the expected ramp up of our international business and the construct of
our global agreement with Nestle.
Moving on to non-GAAP operating margin. We continue to expect a modest amount
of margin expansion each year, which moves our outlook from our previous range of
17% to 18% to a new range of 18% to 19% beyond ﬁscal 2021. Given our overall state
of recovery this year, we've guided ﬁscal 2021 to a range of 16% to 17%. The modest
annual margin expansion we're expecting will yield an incremental percentage point
of non-GAAP operating income growth, thereby translating top line growth of 8% to
10% to bottom line growth of 9% to 11% on a stabilized basis.
As before, our margin equation is a function of pluses and minuses, netting to an
improvement in margin each year. On the plus side of that equation, we expect
beneﬁts from sales leverage, supply chain savings, store productivity improvements
and G&A eﬃciency. On the other side of that equation, we anticipate annual inﬂation
as well as ongoing strategic investments, primarily in the areas of partner wages and
beneﬁts, technology and environmental sustainability. These investments are
strategic and necessary to build our brand and drive top line growth over the long
term, reinforcing key points of competitive advantage.
Let's move on to capital allocation. Our capital allocation model inclusive of
proceeds from new debt issuances consistent with our long-term leverage target will
continue to shift to a slightly lower percentage allocated to capital expenditures,
yielding continued improvements in the conversion of net income to free cash ﬂow.
Additionally, the expected EPS impact of capital allocation has changed slightly.
First, we continue to prioritize high return growth oriented investments and thus
expect annual CapEx to range from $1.9 billion to $2 billion over the next three years,
building our brand, but growing at a rate that is below our expected earnings
growth and led by investments in new stores, technology, global supply chain and
environmental sustainability, all strategic drivers of growth.
Second, we are committed to sustaining an attractive dividend, targeting an earnings
payout ratio of approximately 50% on a stabilized basis, which equates to an
estimated yield of about 2%.
And third, share repurchases. We continue to expect our ﬁnancial leverage to return
to our long-term target of three times lease adjusted EBITDA towards the latter part
of ﬁscal 2021 consistent with an investment grade credit rating of BBB+ or BAA-1.
Subsequently, we anticipate a healthy and relatively steady return of shareholder
capital to resume in ﬁscal 2022 through ongoing share repurchases. However, givenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 20 of 36our greatly enhanced valuation compared to where we were two years ago, we
expect this will yield an EPS beneﬁt of about 1% net of incremental interest expense
as we maintain our long-term leverage target. This is down from an EPS growth
contribution of about 2% previously.
On the subject of capital allocation, I do want to spend a minute on new store
returns, which continue to be very robust. Our new store development is heavily
concentrated in our two lead growth markets, the US and China. And as you can see,
the estimated year one pro forma returns remain very compelling at approximately
50% in the US and 70% in China for ﬁscal 2021 age-class stores.
These high returns are supported by two factors. Number one, a high sales to
investment ratio as our stores unlike other food and beverage retail concepts don't
have capital intensive kitchens. And number two, high cash margins, considering
that our stores unlike other F&B retail concepts are high margin beverage forward
operations and don't require nearly as much advertising support, given the
prominence of our brand and the strength of our digital customer engagement
platforms. When you consider that our weighted cost of capital is in the high single
digits, it's easy to see how these high returning capital investments create substantial
value for our shareholders, while also growing our business.
So when you add up all the various pieces, revenue growth of 8% to 10% converts to
a non-GAAP operating income growth of 9% to 11%, which then converts to non-
GAAP EPS growth of 10% to 12%. This enduring equation delivers double-digit
growth at scale with an overall higher quality growth compared to what we outlined
two years ago.
I'd like to emphasize that this is an ongoing model that we expect will sustain
through ﬁscal 2024. However, as I indicated earlier, the impact of the pandemic will
modify the shape of this model over the next couple of years. For ﬁscal 2021, we are
reaﬃrming non-GAAP EPS ranging from $2.70 to $2.90 on a 53-week basis,
representing a very dramatic rebound of ﬁscal 2020 EPS, which was heavily
impacted by the eﬀects of COVID-19. For ﬁscal 2022, we're expecting a year of
outsized EPS growth, even though we'll be lapping the 53rd week from ﬁscal 2021
because we'll also be lapping signiﬁcant recovery impacts from ﬁscal 2021, yielding
non-GAAP EPS growth of at least 20%
And for ﬁscal 2023, we expect to stabilize our ongoing non-GAAP EPS growth
algorithm of 10% to 12%. Of course, all of these growth estimates presume no new
material business disruptions, whether from the pandemic or the broader economy
comparable to what we experienced in ﬁscal 2020 in part because we believe we've
established through our rapid innovation and the accelerated transformation of
dense metropolitan trade areas in the US and Canada, a new level of resilience for
the future. These scenarios also assume stable foreign exchange rates over our
three-year planning horizon.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 21 of 36A - Kevin Johnson
OperatorI would like to emphasize that these estimates collectively represent what we call our
baseline scenario. There is another scenario that could materialize as we explore
strategic options to further streamline our company, including the licensing of
certain markets outside the US and China. These potential licensing opportunities
could enable us to further enhance the overall ﬁnancial proﬁle of our company.
Assuming we licensed these additional markets and redeploy the capital, non-GAAP
EPS growth will remain at least 10%, non-GAAP operating margin will approach 20%
and ROIC will approach 30%. This of course is predicated on our ability to identify
the right operating partners for these markets to transact at commercially reasonable
terms and to deploy the capital in an accretive manner. In each case, our overriding
goal is to ensure that the Starbucks brand is growing and thriving in every market,
where we are present. In any event, we expect this opportunity to materialize no
earlier than ﬁscal 2023, given the length of time required to explore and consider
potential strategic options.
On the subject of ROIC, I'd like to highlight how our baseline expectations will
enhance Starbucks enterprise ROIC in the years ahead. In recent years, enterprise
ROIC had declined from about 25% to 20%. We expect to reverse that trend and
restore ROIC above 25% in ﬁscal 2024 with the potential for additional upside to
nearly 30%, assuming further streamlining.
To conclude, I remain very excited about our long-term growth potential and the
plans and initiatives that we have to unlock the full potential of the Starbucks brand
and continue to drive double-digit earnings growth. Our growth at scale agenda has
provided the focus and discipline to deliver more consistent operating results. And
while the pandemic temporarily disrupted our business, it has served as a catalyst for
more rapid innovation and transformation to position Starbucks for an even brighter
future, giving our customers ever-increasing opportunities to enjoy a premium
experience whenever and wherever they are.

Great. Thank you all for the very comprehensive presentation. Pat, I appreciate the
potential upside of the model in 2023 for potential franchises and I think Michael's
presentation deﬁnitely showcased the appealing attributes of the company's
licensed markets and most international markets. But if I put it all together, is the
intention to attach development agreements to these deals to help accelerate
development in these markets that perhaps we could see 30,000 plus stores as we
get to 2030?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Why don't I let you start and then maybe, John, you can add a bit to Michael. Go
ahead Pat.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Certainly. Thank you, Andrew. It's part of our standard practice when we do enter
into licensing agreements for any of our markets to establish development targets.
So with the prospect of additional market licensing, we would absolutely look at the
market potential and work with prospective license partners to determine what is an
appropriate pace of future development for those markets. John?
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Yeah. And I would just emphasize the point that we work very closely with our
licensed partners on those development agreements. And in particular, how we map
the market and really what are the portfolio stores that we wanted to put in place. In
addition to the stores, it's how do they continue to invest in the business, invest in
the people, build out the digital ﬂywheel, the product innovation pipeline and
accelerate the growth. Clearly, the returns from a Starbucks store is very attractive to
licensees. And based on those returns, they want to grow new units. So it's a great
partnership for us.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
And Michael, you've been very close to our licensed partners this last year. You want
to add a little bit of perspective on that?
{BIO 18036959 <GO>}
Yes. I would add that our focus is on two things, one is ensuring that the economic
model is attractive to our licensees. And then secondly, we want to apply the key
models of success that we know work in our lead markets to our international
licensed markets and digital ﬂywheel is a huge opportunity for us to do that. And so
we see a huge opportunity, both in our existing markets as well as ultimately getting
into new markets as well.

Hi, good afternoon. My question is for Pat. Pat, just wanted to get more perspective
on your guidance for 2022 and it sounds like you're looking at margins -- operating
margins were turning to 18% to 19% by that year and if you can conﬁrm that I heard
that correctly. And then what are the factors that are going to drive that margins so
much higher where it was in 2019? And then that's question number one. And then
the second part of the question is, if you could give us some perspective on what
revenue you're assuming for 2022 in your guidance?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Thank you, David. So with respect to ﬁscal '22 and why we're anticipating that it will
be a year of outsized growth relative to our updated long-term growth algorithm, it's
because we continue to expect ﬁscal '21 to be a year of recovery. And focusing on
our two lead growth markets, we are anticipating that our comparable store sales in
the U.S. will be fully recovered by the end of our second ﬁscal quarter and
comparable store sales in our China market will be fully recovered by the end of our
ﬁrst ﬁscal quarter. So that gives us some shape to the overall year. We've also
communicated that we expect margin recovery this ﬁscal year to trail sales recovery
by a couple of quarters. So with ﬁscal '21 being a year of recovery as we lap that
recovery year in ﬁscal '22 that is what is contributing to the outsized growth from
both a sales perspective as well as a margin expansion perspective. So it would be --
the cumulative eﬀect of the recovery this year with the margin improvements that
we've even seen this year as we've rebuilt sales based on the overall shape or
composition of our sales combined with the growth that we expect across ﬁscal '22
that would land us in that range of 18% to 19%.
Now, as I said, we are anticipating that our ongoing growth model is going to deliver
incremental or marginal improvements in margin each year. So with the target range
of 18% to 19% for the next three years, we would anticipate that ﬁscal '22 would be
toward the lower end of that range and ﬁscal '24 would be toward the higher end of
that range, allowing us to continue to deliver those annual improvements in
operating margin. But I'm not going to guide the speciﬁc revenue associated with
the margin performance we're expecting for ﬁscal '22.
Your next question comes from the line of Jeﬀrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please
proceed with your question.
{BIO 7208345 <GO>}
Great. Thank you very much. Good to see everyone. Just a question speciﬁc to
China. Actually two part question. The ﬁrst, I think you mentioned you opened more
than 250 stores in the ﬁscal fourth quarter, obviously, there were some units
pushback from earlier quarters, but it just shows that you could saw inclined to a
thousand plus units in the ﬁscal year. I think you guided to 600 in ﬁscal '21 which
would be 12% growth and you mentioned that being down from 15% prior. So
hoping you could talk broadly on the gating factor so faster growth whether it's justFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

consumer demand isn't that strong. Just trying to get a sense for the ability to or why
not be able to accelerate that?
And then separately the MSR number you mentioned, I think you mentioned in
China that $13.5 million today that's up, I think, it's a 35% from just a quarter earlier.
Seems like it's quickly catching up to the U.S. number. Just wondering what drive
that China growth and maybe what could be shared with the U.S. to accelerate the
U.S. numbers? Thank you.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
John, why don't you take the China question, then I'll add a little bit of perspective.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Okay, great. Jeﬀrey, thanks for the question. First oﬀ, let me just be clear on store
growth as it relates to China. We will continue to grow and accelerate the net new
stores over the course of the next three years. And make no doubt about it, there is a
huge runway for growth in China as it relates to new stores. New stores drive roughly
70% of our top line revenue growth and we want to continue to accelerate that. What
you are seeing is the fact of what you mentioned Jeﬀrey that as we continue to grow,
we get to a larger base, so we've brought down slightly to the low-teens our growth
rate going forward. But make no doubt about it, we see a tremendous runway for
growth. What you saw in the fourth quarter was the re-acceleration impact from the
delay that we went through last year as it relates to COVID. And you'll see this year
that our growth from new stores will be much more evenly based quarter to quarter
as we look to this year.
Now when you look at digital, digital was a huge uptick for us with this past ﬁscal
year. And if there is one silver lining coming out of COVID was the fact that as we
introduced contactless payment in our stores or contact -- the contactless
experience in our stores, customers went to our digital app and digital orders
increased, actually digital orders now account for 26% of transactions. And as I
shared that was more than double than where we were last year at this time. Mobile
Order & Pay, mobile order and delivery, each of those account for about 13% of the
transaction levels as it relates to digital transactions. So what we've been able to do
is we've been able to up level our Starbucks Rewards program. We've been able to
increase the relevancy of our app and the accessibility. We've built the app across
multiple platforms in China now, where customers can get to it a lot easier and we're
seeing the beneﬁts of that where customers are digitally engaging with us and really
driving incremental growth for us as a company. So we're very optimistic that the
digital ﬂywheel is enhancing the third place and enhancing the overall experience
for Starbucks, and it's what the customers want.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Thanks, John. Let me just set some context on why we believe this net new store
growth is possible and so important. And then Roz I'll hand it over to you to take the
second part of his question on U.S. digital ﬂywheel. As I mentioned in the opening,
the coﬀee addressable market is projected to grow at roughly a 5% to 6% CAGRFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 25 of 36A - Roz Brewerover the next several years to $450 billion addressable market. Now within that
addressable market, there is also a mixed shift going from mainstream Robusta
coﬀee to premium Arabica coﬀee. So the combination of the growing addressable
market, the mix shift to premium coﬀee and the fact that we establish and build the
Starbucks brand store by store and the experience that we create in those stores
around the world. So you look at that growing addressable market, you look at that
mix shift to premium Arabica coﬀee, that's why we see net new store growth in every
market. John spoke about it in China, Roz spoke about in the U.S., Michael talked
about it with our international markets around the world and Pat even summarized
by 2030, this view that we would be at 55,000 Starbucks stores. And so what we are
seeing as we come out of the pandemic, there is a little bit of a pause in the net new
store development while markets are dealing with the pandemic, and as soon as that
gets under control a bit and what we've seen certainly in China and we're seeing it
now happening in the U.S. and other markets is that net new store development
starts to take oﬀ.
So we're very optimistic about the future of our ability to grow our net new store
count. I do believe that this growing addressable market for coﬀee will continue. I do
believe that the focus we have on the customer experience, on beverage innovation,
on digital customer relationships and the investments we have made in Starbucks
partners is going to fuel our ability to continue to grow our stores around the world.
And so with that, Roz, I'll let you comment on the second part of his question which
had to do with digital ﬂywheel in the U.S.
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Sure. Thank you, Kevin. So a couple of things to think about as we stated as we were
exiting in Q4 that we expect comp growth to be between 17% and 22% as we get
through ﬁscal year 21. It's going to come in two forms both eﬃciency and in new
demand. And from an eﬃciency standpoint, we're seeing growth in our most
productive models like drive through. We're also seeing growth in the application of
options from our digital ﬂywheel. For instance, mobile order and pay, we have one --
four transactions right now coming from mobile order and pay. We also have growth
in our new SFE that was just announced and that starts for everyone that was
announced in September. And as we grow new members, we know that that grows
the business overall. Also two, we're also seeing great improvement in our new
platforms and so new platforms in the form of curbside and delivery. And those are
two new platforms that we were already working on prior to COVID and are now
accelerating as we've gotten through this time frame.
We're also expecting a repositioning of our store portfolio in the U.S. through our
trade area transformation work and that signiﬁcant work for us. We talked about the
800 store closures, but in those closures is repositioning from everything from a
convenience model to the range to our full service reserve stores. And so we will be
creating a portfolio of stores that really meets the customer where they want to
address their coﬀee needs. And so we're excited about that, it's continued growth
for us and it keeps us on the trajectory to meet the numbers that Pat disclosed
earlier.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
(Technical Diﬃculty) As best we can and then applying that to either their preference
for ordering or how we develop beverages or how we create new stores. So you'll
see it in the form of the eﬃciency of our drive throughs. So you'll see handheld POS,
which we have in a number of stores and it's growing throughout the year. You will
also see us do some work that's more deliberate around the design of our drive
throughs too that will have us -- allow us to do a two-lane drive through and the
technology behind that. It will also enable some of the eﬃciencies in the store. So
understanding preventive maintenance on our equipment. So our espresso
machine, so that we can reduce downtime in the stores and provide an opportunity
for our partners to really interact with our customers, and we know when we grow
customer connection it grows the business. So we will use AI in so many diﬀerent
ways in our store to enable either eﬃciency or either to improve productivity for the

{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Roz, do you want to take the ﬁrst part of his question on holiday strategies in the U.S.
and maybe John, you do the same on China.
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Sure. So let's start with the holiday strategy. So we've been fortunate to use our app
to remind our Starbucks Rewards customers of gift cards and we have seen a nice
performance of our gift card so far throughout the season. Great displays in stores
where you can still walk into stores and then also through their digital menu boards
as you go through drive throughs. So through our app performance, we're able to
really put the gift card back in front of customers and then have them walk into
stores that are available for walk-in, and we have a considerable number of our
stores available for walk-in as well as drive through, so gift cards are on well display.
I'll also mention that it's been really exciting to see how customers when they are in
the stores and I was working store last Friday and groups coming in buying family
gift card. So we feel pretty conﬁdent about gift card sales this season in the U.S.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Yeah, John for China, obviously we look at the holiday is a critical time period for us
across the entire business. Gift cards in China aren't nearly as relevant as they are in
the U.S. And what we see in China is the digital gifting. And so you're seeing a lot of
digital gifting take place, which is great to see and all indications are that we're
having a strong performance for the holiday season. And then more importantly in
China is the merchandise, we sell a lot more merchandise in China and in Asia
overall than we do in the U.S. and generally it's must have merchandise for
customers. And so we're continuing to sell that in addition to the trio of holiday
beverages that we normally oﬀer. So all in all, we are setting up what we feel is going
to be a great holiday season for us in China.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
And John let me take your question on competition. Look, we have always had a lot
of competitors in this particular space, and we always will. Our focus has been on
doing what we believe deﬁne Starbucks and what is uniquely diﬀerentiators of the
experience that we create for our customers. So our focus on investing and creating
a great experience for our partners because we know they create a great experience
for our customers. The investments and the focus that we have on customer
experience, beverage innovation and digital customer relationships are all focused
on those ﬁve consumer shifting trends that I described sort of in the opening, and
we believe that by doing that and doing that well we earn those customer visits and
we do it each and every day.
Now I'm pretty optimistic that as vaccines rollout and as the pandemic begins to shift
into a diﬀerent phase that certainly as we started opening limited seating in ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

Q - David Palmer
A - Patrick Grismerstores with very limited seating it was immediate, customers were there, they want to
be a part of a community, it was sort of that ﬁrst consumer trend that I described.
This social recession has aﬀected everyone on this planet and Starbucks is and will
become destination number one for community, in my opinion. And so we are
positioned to do that and do that well, and by doing that, we earn every one of those
customer occasions by delivering a great experience.
Now I'll also comment that there are many people that are really hurting right now.
There is many people in this country around the world who are unemployed, there's
many small businesses that are hurting and this is where, in the United States, we
need Congress to take action and we've been very clear and supportive of a relief
bill that helps all small businesses including independent coﬀee shops. And so I
want to separate sort of the pain that small businesses and many people in this
country and around the world are going through from sort of -- this is not a
competition, we are grounded in humanity and we want to do what we can to create
a great experience for our customers and it starts by how we take care of our
partners, and we believe we're every step of the way, we have prioritized the three
principles that have guided us throughout this pandemic and I think that will serve
us well as we come out of this.

{BIO 6061984 <GO>}
Thanks. A question maybe for Pat, but you could broaden it to everybody including
Roz, I'm thinking about the U.S. here, when you're thinking about the sales and proﬁt
per store in '22 sort of the post-COVID time and you're comparing that to the pre-
COVID year of ﬁscal '19, what sort of stacked growth, what sort of comparative
growth would you be thinking about for that year. And I'm sure, there's a
tremendous number of factors you were thinking about and it's tough to guide, but
clearly, you had great momentum at the beginning of this ﬁscal year to pre-COVID
and there's going to be some lingering weakness in places like urban centers and
travel, but there is pent-up demand and you're doing a lot of great stuﬀ on cold
beverage. So how should we think about that multiyear growth as you're thinking
about it? Thanks.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
David, very good question in terms of the progression of our proﬁtability, particularly
coming out of the COVID pandemic. And as you know, we announced back in June,
the acceleration of our trade area transformation initiative, capitalizing on the
opportunity to transform the phase of our retail business here in the U.S. and that is
contributing to sales and margin improvements this year that will extend then into
the following year and will be a fundamental part of how we are able to land the
long-term growth model that I described both in terms of the improved same-store
sales or comp sales growth, range of 4% to 5% as well as helping us land in that new
range of margin of 18% to 19%.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

Operator
Q - Sharon Zackﬁa
A - Kevin JohnsonNow how you think about ﬁscal '22 versus ﬁscal '19, I would actually suggest that you
monitor our business this year, that is ﬁscal '21 in relation to ﬁscal '19, as we begin to
lap the impacts of COVID from last year, because as we begin to do that in the U.S.
toward the end of March and in China in the month of February, what you're going
to see a one-year comps that someone might describe as monster comps, because
they're lapping signiﬁcant negative comps from the year before. It's not as simple as
doing the addition and looking at a two-year stack, given the magnitude of these
individual comps, both positive and negative. You have to look at a compound
annual two-year growth rate and that's what we're going to be monitoring. We
would expect that as we begin to lap those impacts from last year, we will see a two-
year compound annual growth rate that will reﬂect healthy growth, that will then
normalize to this range of 4% to 5% as we move into ﬁscal '22.
Coinciding with that, we would expect to see very signiﬁcant improvements in unit
level proﬁtability both as a consequence of the sales recovery and capitalizing on
the improvements we've made in store productivity even through the pandemic
coupled with the incremental impacts of the trade area of transformation which
through a change in the composition of our store base will read out lower
performing stores, will introduce more high volume, high margin stores like drive
throughs and collectively those will transform the face of our retail business, our
company-owned retail business here in the U.S. So it's really a collection of those
factors that would contribute to the improvements in sales and margin. But as you're
thinking about how best to assess the progress we're making, I would point you to,
two-year comps on a multiplicative not additive basis as we begin to lap the eﬀects
of COVID from last year and that's -- we're going to be focusing on and will draw
investor attention to when we reach that point with our businesses.

Hi, good afternoon. I guess given the focus in the U.S. on the drive through format,
I'd be curious to know kind of where your drive through format is trending today in
terms of throughput and how that compares relative to the year ago. And frankly,
how fast do you envision the drive through could potentially be and how do you get
there?

Q - Brian Bittner
A - Patrick GrismerRoz you can take that and maybe talk about some of the initiatives you guys have
been doing to improve throughput
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Sure. So ﬁrst of all, as I mentioned, drive through is one of our most productive units
that we have in the entire ﬂeet. And we continue to build those through our
portfolio. And so the tactics that we have range from actually looking at our current
standing operating procedures and optimizing those and that's things like making
sure that we have equipment placed really close in line where the Barista can really
have great movement and very eﬃcient movement. So that's current standing
operating principles that we have on the current model.
And then secondly, we're looking at model shifts. And in that model shift, what we're
looking at are things as signiﬁcant as a side-by-side lane drive through. And also the
handheld POS that we have that are coming into the stores right now and we're
seeing great improvement in terms of out the window times as we really create an
opportunity to rush that line through. I would also add in that is that we're looking at
other things to simplify inside the store, so reducing complexity in the model of
things as simple as what are the beverage preparations and food preparations
looking at ovens and with faster speed times, and the AI that we're applying to our
equipment in the stores, all of that will lead to improvement in eﬃciency and the
drive through as we go through a process of looking at where we are right now with
the current units that we have and then creating new formats that really optimize that
convenience work that we're doing. So that's the really totality of the work that we're
doing around drive through to improve out the window times.

{BIO 17258322 <GO>}
Thanks. Wishing everyone a very safe and very happy holiday season. My question is
for Pat and it's a follow-up on the company's enterprise level EBIT margins, you
obviously had the previous target in that 17% to 18% range and you did raise that to
18% to 19% today. And the question is how much of this margin change versus the
old guidance is directly related to the changes in your business mix that are accretive
to the enterprise such as the upcoming closing of the underperforming stores and
the channel development margin structure change versus how much of the change
in guidance is really related to just fundamentally better proﬁt proﬁle of the
company related to drivers on the operating side of the equation?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Yes, Brian Very good question as we've communicated previously the impact of
trade area transformation this year is quite meaningful from a margin perspective
given the cadence of store closures and new store openings with new store
openings very heavily weighted toward the high volume, high margin drive
throughs. So it changes the overall composition of our retail business, our company-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

Page 31 of 36Operator
Q - Gregory Francfort
A - Kevin Johnsonowned retail business, and we expect that that will deliver around a 40 basis point
margin improvement for ﬁscal '21 and so that provides us a good foundation to build
on through then the inner workings of our growth model as it relates to how we
leverage sales growth, beneﬁt from productivity improvements, additional G&A
eﬃciency and supply chain savings to help further pay for the very signiﬁcant
investments we're looking to make in our people positive agenda and our planet
positive agenda in the interest of strengthening our brand, which is fundamental to
our ability to achieve the higher level of ongoing comp sales growth. So the two are
interrelated.
And it is then the interplay of the tailwinds that I mentioned to help pay for the
headwinds in terms of the investments and how those tend to weigh on operating
margin, that lands us in a place where we're able to achieve those incremental
annual improvements in non-GAAP operating margin that initially land us toward the
bottom end of that 18% to 19% range and at the end of the three-year planning
timeframe get us to the high end of that 18% to 19% range. So we do get a lift, a
boost, if you will, from trade area transformation, but then it is the way that we've
designed our ongoing growth model with the pacing and sequencing of
investments to drive top line growth to yield the incremental annual margin
improvement that sustains operating margin in that new range of 18% to 19%.

{BIO 22252878 <GO>}
Hey. (inaudible) question and thanks for all the detail. My question is in terms of
looking at the margins after the pandemic versus before and this stepped up guys
date in the 90%, how much of that is driven by a greater assumption in terms of the
digital mix and I don't know the way to answer it is by what the diﬀerence in margin
between a digital transaction and a non-digital transaction is. But can you maybe
frame up how much that might be beneﬁting the multiyear margin beneﬁt? Thanks.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Well, let me just comment and then maybe I'll let Pat add some numerical
perspective. Certainly when a customer orders on the mobile app, that is a bit more
eﬃcient. Today you think customers want safe familiar convenient experience is, it is
the most convenient safest way and its personalized, it's very familiar. And so
certainly ordering on that mobile app is the most eﬃcient way to order. But that's
just one piece of it. I don't think we've quantiﬁed in terms of how much -- what the
impact is on margin from that. But one thing I do expect, I do expect we are going to
have more and more digital customer relationships. Those relationships will lead to
deeper interactions and more frequency as we always see and so much of the digital
relationship is more about complementing the in-store experience that we create
with a digital customer relationships so we can drive deeper intimacy and a
personalized relationship with the customer. Most of it is really about driving
customer relationships less about driving eﬃciency.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

A - Kevin Johnson{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
That's exactly right. And while it is true that we do see some incremental eﬃciencies
associated with the higher mix of digital sales contributing to our total sales growth,
that provides us the leverage to achieve higher levels of operating margin. It's also
true that with our digital platform, we're expanding our Starbucks Rewards
membership which means that we're granting more rewards. And there is a cost
associated with that to provide the outstanding value that customers have come to
expect from our rewards program. So that tends to be a bit of an oﬀset to some of
the other eﬃciencies that we might gain from an operating perspective as a
consequence of a higher mix of digital orders when we're looking at the total sales.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Roz anything else you want to add on that one, Roz.
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
The only thing I would say is that it's the addition of stars for everyone also gives us
the ability to grow our Starbucks Reward members. And so as you think about this to
think about how there is new demand coming on top of this through stars for
everyone. So not only the equation of what's more eﬃcient, what cost more, just
think about where our growth is coming from and we're seeing growth in that area
and we'll continue as we improve our digital ﬂywheel.

straws as the default in our cold beverages and shift to our straw-less lids. We still
have straws for those customers that request them, there are certain customers with
disabilities that need those straws. But we were shifting to paper straws to
compostable sorts of straws. The day we announced that move to eliminate those
plastic straws is the default by 2020.
The volume of positive customer feedback that we got was phenomenal, I mean, it
was billions of people around the planet sharing this on. And so we know through
the research that we've done that this is something that resonates with our partners,
it resonates with our customers. And candidly, it's something that I believe
businesses, citizens and government leaders have to unite on, if we're going to make
a diﬀerence on this.
Now we did a full audit of our carbon footprint, our waste footprint as well as our
water usage, and we published that information in January when we launched this
initiative and we set certain targets to reduce our carbon footprint by 50%, reduce
our waste by 50% and reduce the amount of water that we are consuming as we
process green coﬀee by 50% by the year 2030. And so if you think about where this
really starts to have intersection with the things that show up in our stores, the two
biggest contributors to our carbon footprint are coﬀee and dairy. And part of this is
that we can help coﬀee farmers around the world improve the yield on their crops
and continue to grow high quality of Arabica but improve the yield. We can meet the
growing demand for coﬀee without additional deforestation, that is a key priority we
have and Michelle in our Coﬀee team they're on it. They've got some great things
that they're launching, in fact, our agronomy research at (inaudible) has ﬁgured out
how to improve the yield of a coﬀee an Arabica coﬀee by something like 5 times to
10 times and it has to do with good agronomy practices and soil sampling and we're
going to reach out and help teach farmers how to do that.
Now by doing that we not only help reduce the carbon footprint, but we also help
those farming families that are managing those farms improve their economic
prosperity, and we can continue to get high quality Arabica coﬀee to meet demand.
So we look at initiatives like that. When you think about plant based now certainly
Roz, I hand over to you to comment a little bit about what we're seeing on beverage
for plant based milks and also some of the plant based food oﬀerings and then,
John, you talked about good, good.
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Sure. So in our fourth quarter numbers we talked about the growing attachment of
food to our ticket. Primarily that was coming from our breakfast platform with the
introduction of our new plant-based breakfast sandwiches both in the U.S. and
Canada and so we've seen some improvement there. The way we look at this is not
as the number of vegans and number of vegetarians, we look at this in terms of the
number of ﬂexitarians, because we also notice that people like to indulge in one part
of the day and then be healthy at the other part of the day. So we're seeing that one,
our breakfast platform is very attractive to our customer base throughout the day.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

through plant-based, and we're seeing that improvement in our food attach. And
then also with beverage, when we think about our beverage innovation going from
soya to almond to milk to oak milk which we have regional and it's going national.
We're seeing higher demand and we're also seeing that there is ways to ﬂex the
amount of sugar added to beverages, which is also interesting as we look at diﬀerent
plant-based milk solutions for our beverages. So those are continuing to grow from
us for us. And also two, I will tell you that the work that we're doing in terms of
knowing our customer better and their preferences is allowing us to look at how fast
we can grow and what their demands are, and as they look at the day of the proﬁle
of the day or their preference for either something that's healthier in their diet. And
so we're learning from the customer moving in their stead and then applying what
we learn around our breakfast platform and our beverage innovation.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
And for China, we continue to see good uptick on our GOOD GOOD campaign and
GOOD GOOD initiative. We've launched across the entire market beyond meat
plant-based menu and it is going very well for us, we're very pleased and we're
going to continue to innovate in that space. We're the ﬁrst retailer of our size and
scale to bring this into the market and we're eﬀectively educating the consumers in
China on this plant-based alternative. In addition, what we're seeing which is really
encouraging is the uptick of oat milk and we've launched that across the entire
portfolio, we're seeing very strong momentum with that and we're going to continue
to innovate on the GOOD GOOD campaign and the GOOD GOOD opportunity that
we see.
Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.
Please proceed with your question.
{BIO 19805519 <GO>}
Thank you. Kevin, you highlighted earlier that Starbucks is one of the few companies
that are key to people's daily lives. Starbucks seems to have one of the most
frequent customer bases in restaurants in part because of the habitual nature of
coﬀee and breakfast, but also just a high level brand aﬃnity. Can you quantify the
level of frequency of the Starbucks Reward customers? So how many times they
come to Starbucks per month or whatever time period relative to a non-Rewards
member? And then just high level to what extent do you expect Rewards customers
to contribute to year fortiﬁed U.S. comp target over the next few years relative to the
contribution over the prior few years?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yeah, let me just -- the high level number without -- I don't have the exact frequency,
but I do know it's roughly 4 times the ﬁrst year that a non-Rewards customer
becomes a rewards customer. It's 4 times the amount of annual spend with
Starbucks in as a Rewards member versus before being a Rewards member and
much of that is increased customer visits, increased customer occasions and certainlyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

A - Patrick Grismersome of it is increased ticket, but 4x is the number as we convert those. Now
certainly I think we've got a big opportunity to continue to expand the number of
Rewards customers and the number of active Rewards customers that we have in the
program. And I think Roz highlighted a great step forward that was launched earlier
this year and starts for everyone, which made it easy for customers to use whatever
payment vehicle they wanted to join rewards and we have a number of other things
that we will focus on as we innovate to expand digital customer relationships. But
certainly we -- this is a world of hyper personalization and to deliver hyper
personalization having that ﬁrst party known customer data and then building that
customer relationship as part of the future of modern day retail and I think Starbucks
has taken a leadership position. But candidly, there is so much more that we can and
will do and we're going to continue to push the envelope on this because it's
important and it allows us to really build that customer loyalty, it allows us to elevate
the experience we deliver to them and it allows us to do it in a very personalized
way.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Kevin if I can just interject at this stage. The 4 times is relative to some of the less
frequent or more occasional customers. I think when we look at the total population
of Starbucks Rewards to non-Starbucks Rewards upon conversion it's closer to about
a 3 times, but the 4 times versus the...
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
4 times for occasional and 3 times for someone who is more frequent, right. So that
will give you a sense of how that really does deepen the relationship.
The last question comes from Fred Wightman with Wolfe. Please proceed with your
question.
{BIO 20893264 <GO>}
Perfect. Thanks guys. It was really helpful to get the update on the ROIs that you're
seeing in the U.S. store base. But can you talk about how that might evolve as you
shift some of the development away from the cafe type units towards more of a drive
through in some of the newer pickup formats?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Let me -- I'll hand over to Pat to give you some of the numbers, but just keep in mind,
those drive through formats also have the cafe seating area, the vast majority of
them do, they're not just driver throughs. It's a combination cafe drive through and
those are some of our highest volume stores and some of our most proﬁtable stores.
So, Pat...
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

Page 36 of 36Yes. So the 50% average return on investment is a portfolio average but as our new
store portfolio is dominated by drive throughs which make up more than 80% of our
new store development currently that is more reﬂective of what we see with drive
through locations. It is true that we do see slightly lower returns at our traditional
cafes and when we're looking at some of the newer formats whether the pickup
format or the curbside format as a stand-alone store, we also see slightly lower
returns, but nonetheless, well above our cost of capital. And therefore with all of
these store types as we embark upon store development, we're creating signiﬁcant
shareholder value.
Well, I want to -- ﬁrst of all, thank you all for the questions and this wraps up the time
that we have here today for the Q&A as this part of the conference. So we really look
forward to sharing more with you in the New Year. I think our January -- our Q1
earnings call is tentatively scheduled for January 26th. And on behalf of Starbucks
and the Starbucks leadership team, we want to thank you all for your time, your
attention, your questions and your interest in Starbucks. And we want to wish all of
you the very best for the coming holidays and for this new year and we'll look
forward to speaking with you again in January.
Thank you, everyone.
