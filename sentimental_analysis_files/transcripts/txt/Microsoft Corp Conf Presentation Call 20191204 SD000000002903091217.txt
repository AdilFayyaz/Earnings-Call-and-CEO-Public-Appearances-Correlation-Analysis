All right. Well. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm very excited to have Microsoft here.
We have Bill. Thank you for coming down. I know, as I said, it's a busy time of year. So
thanks for making the time for us, really.
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Absolutely.
I know everybody in the audience appreciates it, too.
Questions And Answers
So I guess for the beneﬁt of everyone in the room, why don't you give us your
background, who you are, what you do, what you do at Microsoft?
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Yes. So I'm Bill Duﬀ. I'm the CFO of our Enterprise -- Experiences and Devices Group.
Experience and Devices at Microsoft consists of our productivity experiences and
also our consumer experiences. So it's covering Oﬃce, Windows, Surface and all of
our hardware products, Gaming and Search.
Yes. The -- let's all -- let's start with Microsoft 365 then. It's like -- perhaps you all have
heard of it. But the -- we've obviously been hearing a lot about Microsoft 365. Can
you help us understand how M365 ﬁts into just the larger vision of Microsoft?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Bill Duﬀ{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Yes. M365 is our productivity cloud. And so it consists of Oﬃce 365. So our
productivity cloud services; Windows, speciﬁcally Windows Commercial; and EMS,
which is our management and identity solutions. And so we bundled these together
under the Microsoft 365 name a couple of years ago. And really, it was a marketing
bundle at that time. These products have been developed, they were integrated
somewhat. But we really didn't have the deep integration that we felt like we
needed. So over the last couple of years, what we've really done is taken these
diﬀerent products across Oﬃce, Windows and our identity management solutions
and integrated them into a holistic solution. And so, one, it's really seamless across
all of these diﬀerent workloads. It's seamless from a customer experience
standpoint. But one of the advantages of integrating them more deeply is we're able
to translate these experiences across Windows, across our Oﬃce experiences and
deeply integrate them with identity management as well.
It's a super important strategic initiative for us. When you think about our overall
productivity business, our customers that have brought into Microsoft 365, they use
more of our services. So they actually bought into our full stack. And they use much
more of our services. And they're much more likely to upgrade to premium SKUs.
And so it's been a big driver of growth for us on the productivity side at Microsoft
over the last couple of years.
Interesting. Yes, I know -- I mean, to your point as sort of just the evolution to date of
M365, I remember in the press release, there was a bundle (event). You start to see
diﬀerent announcements of deep technical integration here, deep (inaudible)
integration here. If you use this plus this, they were added together. So as you think
about sort of the go forward, how do you imagine M365 to continue to evolve?
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Yes. M365, we really got to have 4 investment areas for M365. Productivity and
collaboration you can see. And we'll talk a little bit later, hopefully, about Teams. And
Teams has really been an exciting product for us. We've seen very, very strong
growth. It's really the new hub for teamwork for companies and for enterprises. And
so we have a strong focus on productivity and collaboration.
We also have a strong focus on security, compliance and management. And so you
can see us investing pretty heavily in the security space. We're making a ton of
progress there. Compliance is also a big opportunity for us going forward.
Then there's 2 new areas that we're excited about from a growth perspective. One is
around business processes and workﬂows. So whether you think about Teams as
really a platform for business processes, we think there's a lot of opportunity in
vertical spaces in that speciﬁc area.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Page 3 of 11Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Bill DuﬀThen the fourth one is really a more forward-looking one around knowledge. We
announced a project we called Project Cortex. And this is really about how
organizations organize and use the data that they have inherent in their organization
to optimize business processes. But also provide new insights into how to run their
organization better.
Interesting. Where are we just in terms of commercial penetration across M365?
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Yes. We still look at it by workload. So Oﬃce 365, we've crossed 200 million now. So
we had a signiﬁcant number of active users of our Oﬃce workloads. And so these
are active users. On the EMS side. So on the management side, we've sold 120
million seats. And so our install base is over 120 million seats right now. And on the
Windows side, Windows Commercial, we spent the last couple of years really
migrating the enterprises to our most modern operating system, Windows 10. We're
more than halfway through that journey. And so we've got -- Oﬃce 365 is very
strongly penetrated in enterprises. EMS and Windows are less so. And so what we're
seeing is Microsoft 365 pull through those products. That's been a big driver of
growth of ours in the last couple of quarters, in the last couple of years. And we also
see growth opportunities going forward, where how do we expand out to -- versus
the information worker, which is the typical Oﬃce user. You can think about Teams
going into ﬁrst-line workers. We think we have big opportunities with SMBs. So we're
pretty excited overall about the growth. We've made a ton of progress, it shows up in
our ﬁnancials. But we've got a lot of growth left.
Yes. So I mean, obviously, you just talked about sort of individual workloads. Maybe
help us think about what sort of M365 unlocks that maybe sort of Oﬃce, EMS,
Windows or a stand-alone couldn't before?
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Yes. I think the way to think about it, there's a bunch of diﬀerent scenarios that we
can talk about. A couple of them that are pretty interesting is around security and
compliance. When you think about all of the diﬀerent, let's say, threat protection
services that we had at Microsoft, we had threat protection associated with Windows,
threat protection associated with Oﬃce, threat protection associated with our cloud
and identity management, really integrating those together. So if you're a Chief
Security Oﬃcer, you have one console, one place to look at what's happening across
your entire estate. And also from a product truth perspective, looking at all of the
data and signals that are coming, right? So we have 900 million Windows 10 devices,
active devices out there. We've got a huge install base on the Oﬃce side. And really,
security is about picking up these signals, picking up these data, making
connections and then being able to do something about it, right? The future of
security is really about how do you automate these processes. So once you have
these signals, how do you automate things like shutting down an endpoint or
protecting the overall estate. We think we have world-class technology. We think it'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 11Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Bill Duﬀa huge opportunity. That's a speciﬁc area where we see big opportunity going
forward where you need to think of it holistically as a product across M365.
Yes. Just to reinforce what he said, we've obviously had quite a number of security
vendors here and another several companies, one of the things that actually several
of them have said is the strides that Microsoft has made from a security perspective
and Windows. I mean, people in the industry are taking note of it. So (inaudible)
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Yes. And if you look at all of the Gartner Magic Quadrants, everything, Microsoft, let's
say, 3 to ﬁve years ago, just didn't even show up in that discussion. Now we not only
see it as a way to protect our products and we see a real diﬀerentiated opportunity
for us. But we're thinking more broadly than that. And so we're thinking about
security as an independent market for us that we're really going after.
Yes. Now obviously, Windows Commercial is a key part of M365. And obviously, it
opens up the door to monetize Windows in more of a recurring mechanism versus a
traditional OEM model. Which is great, too. It's great revenue. (inaudible) But maybe
walk us through sort of what is the value prop of Windows Commercial? And kind of
going forward, how do you think about growth of this?
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Yes. Windows Commercial is sort of a less-known business for us at Microsoft. So we
talk about it publicly when we report our quarterly results. We talk about it as
Windows Commercial. And this is a version of Windows and associated services that
we sell directly to commercial customers. So one of the things that's really important
to us is we sell it as part of Microsoft 365. So it's part of our standard go-to-market
motion that all of our account executives talk about when they sell M365. And so it's
part of the M365 suite that we talked about the integration before. But it also -- that's
a little bit of a diﬀerent business model for us. So it gets us on a recurring business
model. And so when you think about a recurring cash ﬂow from Windows, not only
do we have the onetime device sale when our hardware partners sell a Windows
device. But we also have this ongoing Windows relationship with our customers.
It is a decent-sized business, let's say, 5 to 10 years ago. But it's an area that we've
grown a lot. And really, what we focused on is what are the features around security,
management and increasingly virtualization and security and compliance that we can
add into a version of Windows that's really service based, focused on the
corporation and part of the overall M365 value proposition. So you've seen
signiﬁcant growth in the Windows Commercial business over the last couple of
years. As a matter of fact, if you looked at our Windows revenue, let's say, 7 to 10
years ago versus today, the most signiﬁcant change in the way that we are capturing
revenue on the Windows side has been the growth of Windows Commercial. It's
been a pretty consistent double-digit grower from a build perspective. For ﬁnancial
analysts out there, there's some accounting.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantI was wondering if you could give a soliloquy on ASC 606 and the impact on
Windows Commercial. Is that totally cool?
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Windows Commercial...
We'll do that at the bar later.
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Yes. We'll do that at the bar later. But it does show up from a revenue recognition
standpoint. You've seen really strong growth over the last couple of quarters in it. But
that's more of a revenue recognition thing. If you think about sort of the underlying
health of that business and the number of new users that we're getting on Windows
and sort of the value prop that we're delivering, it's been a consistent double-digit
grower. And so we're excited about it.
Got it. Now I'm sure you haven't gotten this question today. But with Windows 7
nearing end of life -- I'm sure this is brand new. So hopefully I'm not putting you on
the spot, how should we think about the impact of that on the Windows OEM
business and Windows Commercial, too?
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Yes, yes. If you look at our results over the last couple of quarters, we've had very,
very strong OEM Pro. That's how to think about our commercial PC sales. So OEM
Pro has signiﬁcantly grown. There's a number of factors there. Economy has been
good. Windows 10 is a great product. And so we're seeing continued demand for
Windows 10. But certainly, the end of support in the Windows 7 end-of-support cycle
has fed into that and really helped drive the growth of our OEM Pro.
As we look forward, we're seeing very, very strong demand currently and over the
last couple of quarters. If anything, it's exceeded our expectations. As we go through
these refresh cycles, if you're a student of history of Microsoft, you've seen refresh
cycles in our OEM business in the past. And so we will see some -- the refresh cycle
show up in our OEM revenue, in our OEM Pro revenue. But we expect with the
demand we're seeing now and the number of devices that we still see on Windows 7
out there, particularly in small and medium business, we still think we have a ways to
go.
Got it. Then this is a question I get asked a lot. Is there going to be a Windows 11 or
are we sticking on perfect 10 forever?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Bill Duﬀ{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Perfect 10. I don't know. I'm not going to make any news on the naming front. When
we launched Windows 10, we really talked about how we changed the overall model.
It used to be, we invested three years in building a new operating system, we
launched it and then the engineering team went back and worked on the next
generation of the operating system. This is much more about continuous
improvement. And it's much more about making sure that we're continuing to move
the Windows OS forward.
You saw us -- recently, we talked about Surface and our new devices. As part of that
launch, we talked about some of the investments we're making in Windows and
Windows 10x to support some of these new form factors that are coming out. So you
should expect us to continue to invest in Windows, modernize platform, modernize
the OS, support new form factors and really invest where we think there is
diﬀerentiation in the Windows ecosystem.
Got it. Let's switch gears a little bit to the Gaming because actually I think that's --
we're at a pretty unique time frame, sort of ahead of the next cycle, ahead of some --
and (got to admit), there's some pretty secular changes, too. So Gaming, how do you
think about, I guess, one, just the evolution of your Gaming business from sort of a
product cycle perspective; then two, from these secular trends that we're seeing?
And I got a follow-up to that.
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely. Xbox has been a great business for us. It's incredible, the fan base of
Xbox and the energy that they bring to that overall business. If you look at that
business today, it's primarily a console business. And we're very strong on the
console. And we've been in that business for a long time. We're at the end of that
cycle. So you're seeing us come out with new consoles next year. We're committed
to the console business. The console business is a signiﬁcant part of the Gaming
business and has some of the highest value gamers that are out there. But when you
think about the broader opportunity for gaming, there are 2 billion gamers in the
world. And they play across all sorts of diﬀerent platforms. So they play across
console. We have a very strong position and have a very, very engaged user base in
console. They play across Windows. Actually, our Windows business is aided by this.
Windows is really the best PC platform for gaming. But we don't really participate in
the gaming engagement on Windows. We have a smaller business there. Then on
mobile, obviously, has been the big growth story over the last couple of years. And
so what we're seeing with these shifts of workloads to the cloud, we see a big
opportunity for us to take this great starting position, this highly engaged user base
and these high-value gaming scenarios and bring them to any endpoint. We service-
based want people to be able to play anywhere. And so that's really our strategy in
gaming. We're really sort of thinking about a much, much broader TAM and
investing behind that. And really, our investments are in 3 areas. One is on the cloud
side and investing in cloud infrastructure in order to deliver those experiences on
those endpoints. Content, you've seen us be very aggressive on the content side.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Bill DuﬀOver the last 18 months, we've doubled our capacity for ﬁrst-party games in terms of
the acquisitions of studios that we've made. And on the community side, we have a
very, very engaged base with Xbox Live, 65,000 -- or 65 million users. And we see a
big opportunity to expand that.
Yes. Interesting. So how do you think about the business model changes, too? So I
mean it's -- are they -- it's great background on sort of the industry change (going
around). How does this impact just the Gaming business model for Microsoft?
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Yes. On the Gaming business model side, you've seen us make some changes as
well. We've always had Xbox Live as a premium subscription business on the
console. But the console is a relatively closed ecosystem. So you have to think
diﬀerently when you think about the business models much more broadly in ways on
the PC. And gaming has evolved diﬀerently on the PC. Gaming has evolved
diﬀerently in mobile. And so we launched Game Pass a little while ago. And this is
our opportunity to bring more people into our gaming platform. It's a great value
proposition. You can play many, many diﬀerent games. You can play where the other
players are. We think community is a big part of that. One of the big diﬀerences
between, let's say, video streaming and game streaming is gaming is a very social --
it's a very social product. And people will go where their friends are. And so that's a
really important element to it. So as we build Game Pass, we're going to not only
build great content, have relationships with both our ﬁrst-party studios. But also
third-party studios, to have great content in Game Pass. But make sure we're
building a strong community there.
Got it. Interesting. The -- all right. Let's talk about xCloud. (inaudible) exciting project
since it's been announced. I mean (can you assess), just at a high level, just your
vision for video game streaming, obviously part of Project xCloud? Then how do you
think about the next-generation Xbox console you just talked about play into this
vision?
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Right. We -- at its simplest, xCloud is about playing the games you want with who
you want anywhere you want. And so it's really about extending the Xbox value
proposition to any endpoint. And so we are very early in the stages. You've seen
other companies invest in this space. We think it's exciting. We think that the cloud
opens up new opportunities and new ways of delivering those experiences to
endpoints that didn't -- couldn't necessarily support them in the past. We love our
starting position because we have great content library that works well. We have a
great, as we talked about, highly engaged user base that's already engaging with
our products. So initial users might be already Xbox users that say, "Hi. look, I have
this great Halo experience at home. And I want to experience that when I'm on a
mobile device outside the home," something like that. There's all sorts of scenarios
you can think about. And so from a end point perspective, it's really aboutFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Page 8 of 11Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

A - Bill Duﬀexpanding our overall endpoint strategy. Azure is the underlying fabric for that.
We've invested heavily in data centers. You can think of this as a really interesting,
diﬀerentiated workload on top of Azure. That's a big opportunity for us.
Yes. So what does video game streaming mean in the context of the console? This is
a question I get a lot. So I'd love to hear your perspective.
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
I think on the console, I think things will evolve over time. I mean, we clearly believe
that the console is going to be an important place where people play games. There's
a lot of advantages to having that processing power local. And certainly, if you think
about xCloud and the investments in the cloud, it's not only about the investments in
the cloud infrastructure, let's say Azure data centers. But it's investments in the
network. You can think about 5G as being a signiﬁcant enabler of these types of
scenarios. We're building our solution to work on 4G. But 5G is going to open up
entirely new opportunities. And so you see diﬀerent parts of whether it be the
processing in the cloud or the network, all of those have to evolve. And the console
is going to be a very, very important part of that through that journey. And so we
invested in the next-generation console. We're really excited about our launch next
holiday. We're bringing a lot of new technology with our partners, a lot of new
content that will leverage that technology. It's an important part of our business. And
you'll see us continue to invest there.
Yes. I feel like the past couple of years have been like the age of the unforeseen
partnerships. (inaudible) Microsoft and Oracle, Microsoft (inaudible) AWS, it's like
cats and dogs sleeping together, (inaudible) sound like Bill Murray up there. But
PlayStation, didn't see that coming. Let's just talk about it. Let's talk about that
partnership with Sony PlayStation. Just go. (inaudible)
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Yes. I mean you're right. Partnerships, I think one of the things that Satya's done
culturally at Microsoft has really opened us up and sort of recentered us on our path
of being a platform company. And so what does it mean to be a platform company?
Certainly, we'll have our ﬁrst-party experiences. And we've talked about some of
those, whether it be on the productivity side or whether it be on the gaming side.
But that doesn't preclude us from -- particularly from a cloud infrastructure side of
being able to work with -- and work with companies that we compete in other areas.
And Sony is a perfect example of that. It's a really interesting partnership.
And I think what it also says is it says something about Microsoft and the trust that
the ecosystem has in Microsoft and how we're going to work both in a ﬁrst-party
perspective and we're going to be aggressive in going after opportunities. We
talked about it with xCloud. We've talked about it with M365. But we're also going to
be very, very strong partners to everybody in the ecosystem. And we deeply believe
we're a platform company. We deeply believe that we have a big opportunity withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

A - Bill DuﬀAzure and our other infrastructure -- our other infrastructure investments to work
across all levels of partnerships.
Got it. Interesting. And so let's switch gears a little bit to Surface and Edge. All right.
So Surface, obviously, we've seen continued (upgrade) popularity above -- it's
actually like a family now. As Head of Devices, I used to think of Surface as that thing,
it's like a family now device. But how do you think about this opportunity going
forward? And also provide me with some of the answer to this in the context of some
of the announcements that we saw in the fall.
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Yes, yes. In October, we had our last Surface event. And we talked about a couple of
things. So we talked about the products that were up for holiday lineup. So we
launched the new Surface Pro 7, which is our next-generation of Surface Pro. That
really started the -- our Surface investment overall. Surface Laptop 3. And we
introduced a new product called Surface Pro X, which is our ﬁrst Surface that is
based on ARM. We had a co-development relationship with Qualcomm to develop it
and tune it for a PC type of environment. And so it sort of talks to how Surface has
evolved within Microsoft. It's a big business. It's over a $5 billion business for us. I
mean this is a signiﬁcant business. It's important to us. We run it. We want to operate
it. We want to grow it. The -- one of the interesting things about Surface is we have
very, very high Net Promoter Score. That's how we think about customer satisfaction.
And so it's really important for us to have our experiences being delivered on
experience -- or being delivered on Surface. We think these are the best Microsoft
365 devices that we have out there. But it's also a very important way for us to
innovate.
And so when you think about the original Surface 2-in-1, Surface Pro, that is an
innovation that eventually got extended out through the ecosystem. I mean you saw
many other companies pick it up and really extend Windows in that way. You're
seeing that with Surface Pro X. Surface Pro X on Qualcomm, we think there's
something very interesting here. We're willing to put our capital behind it. It's
expensive to develop devices. And it's something that we think is important for the
future. So we're willing to invest. We're willing to partner with Qualcomm on this and
really push that forward. You see it with Surface Hub, which is our meeting
collaboration device. And so we're -- the Surface business is great. We're excited
about it. And it's a big, strategic focus of ours in Microsoft 365.
Another part of the family, (a mini part of the family, back to the future), Neo and
Duo. So I guess how -- what was the decision or thought process of sort of getting
back into the smartphone business but also the twist is on the Android platform?
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Yes. I think it blew a lot (of peoples' minds). We're not the best at -- I shouldn't say it
this way. But everything leaked before the Surface event, except for Duo, which wasFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 11Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Bill Duﬀkind of amazing. And I think it was a little bit of a head-scratcher. And people were
saying, "Well what's going on here?" And really, it comes back to our focus on the
user. And so we feel like there's some really interesting innovation that's going on in
dual-screen devices. So if people missed the announcement, we announced 2 new
devices that are not being shipped until next holiday. And both of these devices --
Neo is a little bit of a bigger device. It's a Windows-based device. And you can think
about it as a 2-screen device that folds up. You can think of it like a tablet. Duo is the
same device, smaller form factor, you can carry it in your pocket and we built it on
Android. But really, our thought process across both of them was the same. We think
there's some very interesting things happening in dual-screen devices. If you look at
dual screens and how people use dual screens. And we did a lot of analysis around
this, people are signiﬁcantly more productive when you have 2 screens. And that's
because you can think about you have a work pane and then you have a reference
pane. There's all sorts of interesting scenarios. And you just work diﬀerently when
you have 2 monitors for the desktop or 2 screens when you have a device. Then
simply, you just -- to get to the Android question on Duo, we make a pragmatic
decision. If we're going to build a mobile phone, mobile phones, the expectations
are that the apps are going to be there. And so we needed to make sure that we
were able to support the Android app ecosystem. It was something we worked with
Google on. And we're continuing to work with Google on. And so to get back to
your partnership point on the strange bedfellows and everything else, this is an
example of the new Microsoft.
It is amazing. So last question. We got 2 minutes. So when you think about emerging
opportunities here in personal computing, what excites you? What does Microsoft
really think about addressing in the -- how to address these in the future?
{BIO 3966952 <GO>}
Yes. It's interesting. We talked about a lot of them. I would say the one thing that I
didn't really mention up-front on the M365 thing is the power of data and the power
of AI that will bring the productivity scenarios. You're starting to see AI get infused in
our productivity scenarios just a little bit. We're doing it in terms of PowerPoint
Designer, Presentation Coach. You're seeing AI show up in our security elements. But
when you think about a company adopting Microsoft 365, you have an incredible
amount of important data that the company needs to use in order to optimize our
operations. And they have an incredible number of signals that are coming in. And
so using that data to bring new employees up to speed quicker, to ﬁnd information
more quickly, to automate workﬂows, to connect dots, to automate processes. We
have this oﬀering called Workplace Analytics, which looks at how the -- how data is
used in your company and communication is used in your company. So you can
think about how can you have more eﬀective meetings? How do you break down
silos in your organization? How do you increase the eﬀectiveness of your sales force?
There's all of these things that, once you have this data. And this data is -- can be
reasoned against in a central location, you can think about all sorts of new scenarios
around AI that are really productive for organizations. And that's one of the most
exciting areas that we see.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04
