We're going to start the webcast right away. Good afternoon. I'm Carol Schumacher,
VP of Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.. And thank you for joining us this
afternoon. We appreciate all of you who have come, some from very far away, to
attend our shareholder's meeting today and also this session with our executive
team. We really value the time that you dedicate to our company.
As you came in, you should have received a sheet of paper that provides you a little
information about the fact that we may be making some forward-looking statements
today. Please refer to our website for additional information about that and for our
ﬁlings.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07

Charles HolleyAnd with that, we're going to get underway. You heard this morning from some
members of the executive team some of the news that we have out there. If you have
not had the opportunity to see and participate in the webcast of our shareholder
meeting today, we did announce a new share repurchase authorization of $15 billion.
That press release is also available on our website. And you can ﬁnd that under the
Investor tab at stock.walmart.com.
So I think most of you who are here with us in Fayetteville, Arkansas, know our full
executive team up here. So we won't take time to introduce everybody. But with that,
we're going to have two remark sessions ﬁrst, one from Charles Holley. And then --
our CFO. And then from Mike Duke, our CEO. And then we will go to open Q&A.
And with that, I'll turn the program over to you, Charles.
{BIO 3319796 <GO>}
Thanks, Carol. And thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Am I on?
{BIO 2078735 <GO>}
You are.
{BIO 3319796 <GO>}
First of all, we're not going to be resetting any guidance right now for the Second
Quarter. So we'll keep our comments around what we said in the First Quarter. But I
just want to reiterate a few things about our priorities, which are growth leverage
and returns.
Hopefully you got the message today that we're very strong ﬁnancially and we're --
we are very -- we strive very much to be consistent in how we perform. When you
look at growth, we know in the First Quarter we were soft. And you saw our guidance
for the Second Quarter. We weren't quite as soft in that guidance.
And I think that speaks to how we feel about the First Quarter, where there was a lot
of noise in the US. And we did see some global slowdown. And I think that the
guidance hopefully speaks for itself, that there's not going to be as much softness as
we saw in the First Quarter.
We're also very focused on expanding our global e-commerce business around the
world. As a reminder, we have put out there that we'll invest an additional $0.09 per
share this year in ramping up our global e-commerce eﬀorts, including $0.02 for the
Second Quarter. Then also very focused on capital discipline, being sure that we're
building the right kind of stores and investing the right way.
The second one, leverage -- the second priority, leverage, just as a reminder, we're
still very committed to our over 100 basis points over ﬁve years to get our SG&A toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 30Mike Dukesales ratio down by 100 basis points. We didn't probably leverage as well as we
would have liked, due to the soft sales in the First Quarter. And I think it's going to
be, as I've said in our call, it's going to be a little bit tough in the Second Quarter. But
we are very committed to do it for the year. And we still feel like there's a lot of cost
and eﬃciency that we can get in our business.
Then, last, returns. I think we've been very consistent the last few years on our -- how
we give back to the shareholder, whether it's the dividends. And you -- if you
watched my presentation today, how we on average have increased our dividend
18% per year for over the last 10 years. And 18% this year, also.
In addition, the share repurchase. We announced the new share repurchase of $15
billion today. And we retired the remaining $700 million of the old share repurchase
authorization. We don't have a timetable for that. But if you look at our track record, I
think that you see that we have a very good cadence of how we use that share
repurchase.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Mike Duke, our CEO.
{BIO 3510931 <GO>}
Thank you, Charles. And ﬁrst, let me welcome you back to Bentonville, Arkansas, for
this, another historic event. I know some of you have been here for many years at the
shareholder meeting. And sometimes some of you have stayed over for a Saturday
morning meeting. And some even may still stay over and still go on your own ﬂoat
trip, like was done many years ago. But I do welcome you. And it's great to see some
of you back again.
I'm really just going to cover four critical areas that, frankly, I'll tell you, areas that I
spend a lot of time on, because I think they are so important to our business,
because I don't -- I don't want to repeat what Charles has already said.
The ﬁrst area that I'm just going to comment on, because I think it is so critical to
success today and in the future. And that is about people. You could see this
morning, hopefully more than any shareholder meeting you've ever been to, that we
spend more time focused on people, talent. So I think having the best talent and the
most engaged associates is such a critical part of Wal-Mart's success and, frankly, we
are in such great position.
You know, I've only been here 18 years. But in the 18 years, ﬁrst, we've got the
strongest leadership team. I mean, those of you that know the individual members of
the senior team, the -- it goes far beyond, down to the store level of engaged
associates serving customers like some that we highlighted in the meeting this
morning. But if you get a sense of that overall energy, I know we get to feel that
energy when we go out and visit stores.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 30I mean, every week, I feel the inspiration to some degree like we felt this morning
from our own people out on the front lines serving customers and having the most
engaged associates, not just in retailing. But in business. And the best talent in
business.
Best talent, I'll give you examples from the associates to store managers, we now -- I
sat through a discussion this week on merchandising -- and from Wal-Mart US to
Sam's Club to the international, we have the best merchant talent that we've ever
had and, I will tell you, the best merchant talent of any mass merchandizing large
retailer anywhere in the world.
Then if I look at areas like e-commerce and -- the ability to recruit the kind of talent, I
am amazed at the quality of -- and the level of talent that we're bringing in of people
that want to join Wal-Mart. They want a challenge. They want to be a part of this
biggest data that I mentioned this morning. And so the thing that I am so excited
about is our ability to recruit and develop the very best people in the world is what
gives me such great excitement about the future of our company.
The second thing -- I'll go back to our founder again -- you heard so much this
morning, also. Even though our primary focus is on people, you heard throughout
the meeting about the productivity loop, EDLC, EDLP. You just heard Charles
mention that again.
This was -- this business model that was created years ago was just a fantastic
business model. It's simple. It's straightforward. We try to operate with as low
expenses as we can. We try to drive down SG&A expense. As I've said, we've done
that three years in a row. You know, as we've said at this meeting last year, we'll have
quarters where we may not on an individual quarter, or we may have quarters where
the gross margin may go up a little bit for some reason. But our overall focus is the
business model. And that's across our businesses.
And even -- as we even go into new markets and we make acquisitions, there is a
way over time to develop the business model that works so well here in the US and
in the U.K., in Canada, across the world. And I really still more than ever believe in
our business model.
The third area that you can see we are absolutely committed to is to win in the e-
commerce, multi-channel, this digital space that -- today the way customers are
shopping. And we want to let customers shop how they want to shop, when they --
where they want to. We just want them to think about Wal-Mart.
It may be by driving their car. But it may be picking up their smartphone. So we are
absolutely committed. And I'm really, really pleased with the progress in e-
commerce. You heard a couple of numbers this morning. I said that we'll do about
$10 billion this year. Neil mentioned I think we had a 30% increase in the First
Quarter. So obviously, you can tell, we're starting to gain traction, not -- I say starting,
because we know that it's an area we still have a long ways to go.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07

Jeﬀ Gearhart
Carol SchumacherThen the fourth area that I just mentioned that is critical to me and it's critical to
everyone here and to our organization, is doing business the right way, doing
business with integrity, absolute compliance. And then the areas of responsibility
that Wal-Mart has really put great emphasis on in recent years, whether it's
sustainability, women's economic empowerment, hiring veterans, the -- our goal to
eliminate hunger in America you can just see this area of responsibility along with
doing it with integrity and full compliance, is I'd just simplify that, too. And say doing
business the right way, because I think that is the right way. And that's the Wal-Mart
way.
So I said as we were talking before we walked out, I know you're really here because
you've got questions. You didn't come to see a long presentation. So Carol, I'd like to
at this time open it up for questions and go right to see what's on everyone's mind.
{BIO 2078735 <GO>}
Okay. Before we get the Q&A underway, I do have one thing that I think -- we would
like to recognize Leslie Dach. Most of you who have been attending our meetings for
a while have certainly seen and heard from Leslie a lot.
And over the last seven years that he has been participating in our analyst meetings,
especially over dinner at the October meetings, I think you have come to also
appreciate the work that Leslie has done and contributed to our company. And this
is Leslie's last meeting with us. So I'd like to recognize and also thank Leslie for all his
work.
And with that, a couple reminders for the Q&A. Quick introductions, on the right side
facing you, Susan Chambers, people; Neil Ashe, dot-com, or e-commerce, global e-
commerce -- sorry, Neil; Ros Brewer, Sam's; Bill Simon, Wal-Mart US; Mike and
Charles you already know; Leslie -- and Leslie's going to take all the questions,
because it's his last meeting; Rollin Ford, who heads up our haul leverage area; Jeﬀ

{BIO 16355444 <GO>}
Ethics.
{BIO 2078735 <GO>}
-- ethics, yes; and last but not least, Doug McMillon, international. So you're free to
direct your questions to any of our executives.
Because we are on the webcast, I would ask you to wait for a mic so that everyone
here and on the webcast can hear the questions. If you'd also please state your
name and your ﬁrm, we would appreciate that, as well. So with that, hands? Robbie, I
think you had yours up ﬁrst before.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Bill SimonQuestions And Answers
Thanks. I guess this is a Wal-Mart US Bill Simon question. But anybody that would
want to chime in would be great. The question is just, can you maybe tell us how you
think about driving sustainable customer traﬃc?
So we're in a world in the US, customer traﬃc's clearly hard to come by for most
retailers. There's one out there, Costco, that seems to be doing a great job at it. But
could you maybe enlighten us and tell us, is -- has the world changed, where it's --
you know, you maybe can't get back to a sustainable, positive customer traﬃc trend?
Or if you can what -- what is it going to take for Wal-Mart US to get there?
{BIO 1907361 <GO>}
Yes, I think we can. You know, I think we had, until this last past quarter, I think it was
six quarters in a row of positive traﬃc. This last quarter that we just ﬁnished was a bit
of an anomaly. There was a lot of strange things going on, the income tax refunds,
the weather issues, the 2% withholding thing.
Our strategy longer term -- in traﬃc driving strategy -- is the productivity loop, the
ability to lower prices, primarily focused on food and consumables, that are the
traﬃc velocity, traﬃc-driving areas. And then leverage the traﬃc from those areas
into the rest of the -- into the rest of the building. And that allows us to kind of
continue to -- to fuel the productivity improvements that we're making and, by the
way, continue to make all across the business so that we can invest back into price.
And as we stay in that sort of virtuous loop, we see traﬃc continue. And I think we'll --
you know, we'll continue to work on it. And don't expect another quarter like the
First Quarter.
But do you think there are new external factors that have changed that generally will
make it more diﬃcult to drive traﬃc?
{BIO 1907361 <GO>}
I think it'll make it diﬀerent. Is it diﬃcult? I think if you take the number of doors that
exist today compared to 10 years ago, retail doors, there's more. So the -- the
number of doors are growing faster than the number of shoppers or shopping trips.
And so it's a diﬃcult, continuous, sort of virtuous diﬃcult cycle of improvement. You
invest, you improve, you grow traﬃc. And you have a quarter like we did the last time
or you don't. And you ﬁgure it out again. And you move forward.
I think you'll see the strong get stronger. And I'd like to put us into that category. And
I think you'll see some of the people who aren't weak suﬀer mightily from -- from
traﬃc issues.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantThank you.
{BIO 2078735 <GO>}
Okay, next question, we'll go to Michael.
Following up on Robbie's question, you mentioned more doors. But there's another
thing going on, which is many of your competitors have followed your lead into
consumables and food. And in point of fact, would it make sense for you to start
focusing a little less on consumables and a little bit more on the rest of the store, as a
point of diﬀerentiation? Because I think that's one of the things that Costco may have
done diﬀerently.
{BIO 1907361 <GO>}
Yes, please don't misinterpret the focus on food and consumables is a lack of focus
on everything else. But the velocity of a pillow is one time every year or two years or
a sheet. The velocity of bananas or milk is once a week or twice a week. You have to
drive velocity through food and consumables.
And with the traﬃc that we get in our business and in our building, we're able to
leverage that traﬃc on the other side. If you -- if you -- if you double your traﬃc on
sheets and towels, you won't be able to -- you won't have any measurable impact at
all on bananas because of the raw numbers. So focusing on food and consumables
is focusing on the balance of the box. It's the same thing.
But if everybody's doing the same thing, how does anybody get an advantage?
{BIO 1907361 <GO>}
You have to do it better than others. You have to have a supply chain that can get it
there faster, fresher, less expensive. And then be able to continue to invest and lower
your price.
Thanks.
{BIO 2078735 <GO>}
Okay, we'll go to Greg. Miguel, if you could reach Greg, please.
Hi, thanks. Maybe just broaden that a little bit more. Charles, you mentioned that
growth, leverage, returns still a focus. I'm sure, Mike, you'd agree with that. But IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 30A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Doug McMillonwonder if it -- if it comes down to a point, like we've seen the last few quarters where
you have to make choices -- like, would I give up a little bit less EBIT margin rate or
give up a little bit of ROI because there's more growth overseas. But the reality is
maybe in overseas markets, margins are just going to be lower.
How do you think about balancing those three when they come into conﬂict? Would
you rather let returns slip or growth slip or leverage slip?
Well I think you have to look and take market by market when you look at our
business, because each market is totally diﬀerent. We've got some great
opportunities in every one of our markets. You look at a Canada, has probably dug
some[ph] of the highest returns in the world for us.
So with what you just said, that means if I do a store that has a very good return in
the US, I've somehow impaired Canada. And I haven't, or I've made a choice for a
lower return. I guess you could say that. But these are all value added to the
shareholder. We don't -- we don't make a capital decision on new stores unless we
think we can get well above our WAC[ph], which would provide value to the
shareholders.
So I don't -- you know, we don't look at it as I'm giving up my ROI. We look at it as,
we want to add value to the shareholder. And that adding value is going to add cash
ﬂow.
And maybe, Doug, could you elaborate on between -- when you're allocating capital
between countries, how do you think about that?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Sure, yes, again, it's hard to talk about the whole division. I'll try to get to the answer
by talking about some of the markets. You know, we have made decisions by market
on what we think is best relative to capital investment and the number of stores. So if
you take the recent decisions that we made fairly recent in China and Brazil to slow
down, each one of those decisions were independent in nature based on what we
were seeing at the moment.
So for example, in China, as I've mentioned before, we were being too
accommodating on some of our store layouts. And as you know, the super-centers
are in malls. And we really needed them on one ﬂoor. We needed good customer
access from a parking point of view and a great layout. And when we gave on too
many of our principles, we found that our performance was not as strong.
So then you go to Brazil. We had some format issues. We stopped. I guess it's been
more than a year ago, proving any maxis[ph] in the cash-and-carry unit, because that
format's not approving -- not performing. So when you add up those individualFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 30Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Mike Duke
A - Carol Schumacher
Q - Peter Benedictdecisions, you end up with the total division having a lower new store growth
number.
When I think about growth, the ﬁrst thing I think about is comp store sales. And
we're trying to grow comp store sales everywhere. And the tradeoﬀs that we make
aren't as cross-country as you might think, maybe not as orchestrated as you might
think, in the short term. Over time, because of the capital decisions, it is coordinated.
But in the short term, for example, we decided to invest in price in Japan to try and
get the level of growth up a bit. So we took a shorter margin to make sure that we
were building customer loyalty in that market. And we didn't make a decision to
raise margins somewhere else because of that.
We just make independent decisions, because each one of these markets has to
grow share over time and deliver return over time. And if we make too many tradeoﬀ
decisions, we'll harm one of our investments in a market.
Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.
{BIO 3510931 <GO>}
I do think -- I might add something to that, Carol, before we go to the next question,
to Greg's question, because this morning, Charles' presentation on consistency. So
looking at the Wal-Mart as part of the Dow over the last ﬁve years. But over the last
10 or 20. And that word consistency, I would love to say that it's all because of the
senior leadership team.
But I will say there's some other big factor that helps to contribute to that
consistency. And it's the fact that Wal-Mart is a portfolio of businesses, both the
mature markets and the developing markets. It's a portfolio of geographies. The
business formats, like a Sam's Club, along with Wal-Mart US. And I -- and I think that's
what gives us a great long-term strength.
And we manage the business long term. We don't really try to focus on something
very short term. And by having a portfolio, it allows us to be really a managed
business long term. But at the same time provide that annual consistency that
Charles displayed on the slide this morning. So this range of portfolio is a real
strength that Wal-Mart has that no other retailer in the world has.
{BIO 2078735 <GO>}
Okay, Miguel, we'll take Peter in the back.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Thanks. Peter Benedict of Robert Baird. For Mike, Mike, last year at this meeting, you
alluded to some plans to bring down the new store capital costs. I think you may
have said 10%. But can you just give us an update, what's your latest thinking there
and more opportunities for eﬃciency?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 30A - Mike Duke
A - Bill Simon{BIO 3510931 <GO>}
I'll ask Bill and Doug to both give a little more by market, because particularly -- and,
frankly, Sam's is, too -- but particularly I think the US Wal-Mart and the international,
where we've had the greatest square footage growth, I'll tell you, since we had this
meeting last year, I've really seen exciting progress.
We talked about CapEx productivity. And in this very meeting, we talked about the
productivity loops. I appreciate you teeing it up, because we said there is a
productivity loop, also, for capital when we build new stores that we can build a store
that can produce the same sales. But at lower capital. And we wanted more
productivity out of every capital dollar that we invest.
And I guess to sit in those real estate meetings. We do -- once a month, we do all the
US business, where we'll sometimes take a half a day, sometimes a whole day on our
US projects. The following day, we do the international projects. Charles and I and
others will sit and go through each project and go through and look at -- I have been
extremely encouraged by the discipline, the challenge of the way to ﬁnd eﬃcient
ways to take -- take cost out from ﬁxturing, to the engineering of the building, to
even how we site projects.
And I see it in the US. And I see it in the international markets, too. So -- Bill, you
might -- you might even have some more speciﬁcs you might want to share, or
Doug.
{BIO 1907361 <GO>}
Sure. In the US, I think we're in our third consecutive year of ﬂat CapEx growth. So
the -- ﬂat CapEx dollars, actually. And we're building more stores -- real estate -- from
real estate CapEx with ﬂat dollars. We're able to do that by focusing on things the
customer wants.
And interestingly enough, Ros' team at Sam's has taught us a lot. If you look at Sam's
Club and Costco, they appeal to a higher income demographic than Wal-Mart does,
yet we were spending more on ﬁxtures than they are. You know, their warehouse
rack. And we're not. We're spending more on sign packages than they were. Our
sign packages was very expensive, for example. We were able to lower that by about
$150,000 a store.
Simple things like putting colored pigment in the concrete ﬂoor instead of having it
be natural concrete saves you a lot of money. So there's a lot of work that's going on
in engineering, the building, the things the customer doesn't value in putting the
money into things the customer does, like price and more stores, more doors.
The shift in strategy from higher -- higher cost geographies into lower cost
geographies, equally as good sites in markets where we have mid; to high share,
allows us to spend less on the site itself. So we can -- we can build for a lot less in
Alabama than we can in Maryland, for example. And in New Jersey.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07

A - Susan ChambersSo if you look and you cite the stores eﬀectively and you build the building so that
you get everything that the customer wants and remove the things that don't add
value to the customer, you can continue to do that. And I think that there's a fairly
long runway for us there.
And an international benchmarking across the markets has helped taking apart what
a building costs for a speciﬁc format and looking at it across markets helps you
understand why steel might be diﬀerent in one market than it is another,
refrigeration might be diﬀerent in one market than it is another.
And we're coordinating buying eﬀorts for equipment more frequently, ﬁxtures,
including refrigeration, creating a standard number of specs, working with the
sourcing team that Rollin leads to migrate the markets towards a cafeteria choice,
rather than just buying whatever they want to buy in their local market. And that's
helping us reduce cost.

down the road and like to get an update of what the strategies are maybe what the
impact is ﬁnancially and how you're -- how we should continue to model that.
And the other one is, obviously, FCPA, if there's any -- any way to give us an update

you've been going through, which has obviously been very, very extensive.

There is some moderate increase that will incur. But our plans already exceed from a

positioned to begin with.

Thank you, Charles.
So on FCPA, as you know, there is an independent investigation that's occurring
under the auspices of our audit committee. Investigations are ongoing in Brazil,
China, India. And, of course, Mexico. Those investigations will go on as long as
necessary and will go where the facts lead us. People up here don't really have any
control over that, because I've said it's independent.
I think you should assume that the -- we spent in the last quarter $73 million. About
$30 million of that was on compliance eﬀorts. The remainder was on the
investigative activities. You should assume that kind of run rate will continue through
the balance of this year.
And we have as a company put signiﬁcant resources towards compliance, including
anti-corruption. I think as Mike said, that starts with people and talent. We've added
a number of positions around the world. Chief -- a new global chief compliance
oﬃcer and international compliance oﬃcer, as well as chief compliance oﬃcers in
every market, anti-corruption directors in every market. We've invested signiﬁcantly

world.
And we still -- it is true, we still have a meaningful number of outside experts. To
date, we've had over 300 third-party legal and accounting experts who've dedicated
in excess of 100,000 hours to these projects. Our goal over time is to -- obviously, as
we build up our compliance infrastructure, to ramp those activities down and notFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07

the costs come down. But I think we'll see these continued costs throughout at least
at a minimum this year.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
And what about the extended timeframe? Is there -- beyond this year, do we have
any feel as to when this might --
Hard to know. You know, there's -- as I said, we don't have a lot of control over that.
And our view is we'll continue to fully cooperate with the government. And it'll take
as long as it'll take.
You should also know that we've broadened -- if you look at anti-corruption and
FCPA, that's one dimension. And that leads you towards looking at permitting
processes and the systems that support permitting and those kinds of things. But
we've taken the opportunity to really broaden and improve our global compliance
eﬀort across 14 diﬀerent dimensions, including ﬁre safety, food safety. And other
types of compliance beyond just anti-corruption.
So that means subject matter expertise for those compliance areas. It means human
resources, program design investments, systems investments across all of the
markets that we operate in international. So there's a lot of eﬀort, a lot of
management time and attention that's being focused on this right now. And it's
making us stronger.
Those costs that I referred to are for the -- run the gamut of not just anti-corruption
compliance. But these other compliance eﬀorts, as well.
{BIO 1504748 <GO>}
No. I agree with that. And I think last -- at this meeting last year, I suggested to Mike
that this was a great opportunity to kind of set a benchmark that's really a high
watermark. And I hope your doing that. And I think you're doing that with 14.
We don't know what -- what all those 14 are. And I think I've asked that question and I
haven't gotten an answer. But we'd love to know some -- at some point in time a
really good case study of how this works worldwide.
Yes. And I think the word we use and the word you'll hear Doug and Mike use is
world-class compliance. That's our goal. And that's what we intend to achieve by this
process.
We're not missing the opportunity. And it's a multi-year project.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07

Thank you.
You know, I might add to that, too, because I started oﬀ this discussion today talking
about doing business the right way, which included the area of compliance and
integrity. In the long run, I say we run the business for the long term. And in the long
term, doing business the right way leads to a better business.
So by having very disciplined real estate strategies and the way that we build new
stores and work with landlords and develop property, by doing that all exactly the
right way and fully compliant, transparent way, in the long term, you end up with
better real estate. By buying from factories that operate very safe factories, in the
long term, you have better quality merchandise.
You know, I think when we work with partners and do business in every aspect in a
fully compliant, right way, it helps us run a better business in the long term. So in
some cases, we may choose to invest in something now. But it's because we may not
be able to see exactly the ROI, like we would a new store. But we know by doing this,
in the long term, we end up with a much better business that will be better for the
shareholders.

{BIO 1496495 <GO>}
John Lawrence, Stephens. Would you talk a little bit about e-commerce and give us a
little update on the investment? How much of this is short term versus long term
returns, where we are on that investment? And obviously, you're making progress.
But what's the step function as far as getting a higher return on those investments?
Sure, I'll take that. As Mike said, our growth has begun to accelerate. And we've
added in Nihaodiyen[ph] in China. So -- so we took our estimate for this year up from
$9 billion to $10 billion.
The dollars that we're investing are really in three areas right now. The ﬁrst is for the
development of a global technology platform. So that powers our sites around the
world so that we get leverage of two kinds, innovation leverage most importantly. So
that the beneﬁts we develop for a market in the US are realized by our customers in
Brazil and other markets as an example, as well as ﬁnancial leverage.
Obviously, we have the opportunity to run this thing once and serve customers
around the world. So we're in the -- we're in the -- I'd say the middle stages of that --FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 15 of 30A - Carol Schumacher
Q - Joe Feldmanof that development eﬀort. And we'll start to realize beneﬁt from that in the next
couple years to come.
Excuse me. The second area of development is around fulﬁllment networks in these
local markets. So we're developing next-generation fulﬁllment networks that
combine e-commerce-dedicated aegis[ph] facilities. So -- where you pick a single
item, put it in a package. And ship it to customers, as well as integration with our
existing world-class logistics systems from warehouses to our transportation ﬂeet.
And ﬁnally using our stores as the -- as the last node in that delivery network. So a
very uniquely Wal-Mart solution to this problem.
We will be investing for years to come in those -- in that fulﬁllment network, in each
of the important markets that we -- that we serve. But as we invest incrementally, we
realize beneﬁt from that. So our cost to serve on each one of those packages comes
down. We're excited that over time we think that this uniquely Wal-Mart solution to e-
commerce distribution can be signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient than what you see out
there today.
Then, ﬁnally, the third area of investment is developing the markets in which we want
to compete, which includes driving marketing dollars and local assortment into each
of these -- each of these markets that we've described.
Now, you asked a question about retail traﬃc and stores. It's the same -- traﬃc is the -
- it's the same game online. And I'm proud to tell you that we've accelerated our
growth in traﬃc around the world. So walmart.com is growing in the US and Brazil.
comScore, which is the external benchmark, rated us number eight in site traﬃc a
little later than this time last year. And we were number two this month, number one
last month. So -- in about ﬁve months, we went to number one. That's a precursor for
where we're going with those.
So taken together, those allow us to serve more customers on a common technology
platform with lower -- with lower cost to serve from our distribution capabilities. So I
wouldn't expect us to stop this investment over the next year or two. We're -- as Mike
said, we're at the beginning stages of this. So $10 billion is not our ﬁnal aspiration.
We are -- we're doing this for the long term.
You know, we've said -- I've said in other venues that, if you look at our company,
we've built capabilities to succeed at every stage of retail. And then we've done
things for customers that no one else can do. We're doing the same thing for e-
commerce. And then e-commerce can be the next growth engine for the company.

A - Carol Schumachertoday were decent -- and yet the lower-end consumer remains under so much
pressure -- and I guess I'm just trying to understand how you guys deal with this
conundrum and how you're going to capture them.
I mean, it's not just you, right? It's the dollar stores, your bit competitor up north. I
mean, everybody's having this pressure. So is there anything -- you would think in
this environment, if they're -- that part of the market's so under pressure, they'd be
shopping at Wal-Mart with more regularity than they were during the recession. I'm
just trying to understand where you see the consumer right now.
I think the US consumer is very resilient. We see -- you know, we see the numbers.
And the numbers would suggest that at least a segment of the economy's getting
better. I would tell you the middle and down and the areas that are our core
customers are -- are ﬁnding a way to deal with the diﬃculties. They report that it's not
getting any better. But it's not really getting any worse, either. And so they've
become adapted -- they've become able to adapt to the -- you know, to the current
situation.
Interestingly, we see things like -- you know, Christmas and Thanksgiving and
Valentine's Day and Mother's Day, they spend like they would. They take care of their
families. And they enjoy themselves. In the interim, they ﬁgure out how to make ends
meet, buying more pork and chicken than they do beef because of the price, trade
from a brand to a private label.
And I just think it's -- it's starting to settle in, at least in the -- in the thinking that this is
the way that it's going to be. And I think you see the customer start to respond to
that.
Just one comment on that from a Sam's perspective. We're seeing it play out with
our small-business member and the way they're treating their spending habits. And
Bill's right. They learned a lot in 2008 during that downturn. And they're much
smarter. They're managing well, though, from a small-business perspective. They're
not investing and adding on additional loans to their business. But they're pretty
smart and really shopping from a list.
But we do see there -- there is some stress when we get feedback from our small-
business members and they're -- they're still pretty cautious right now. But they're --
they're shopping very smart right now.
But it is encouraging, to be honest with you, that they can ﬁgure out how to operate
in an environment like this.

A - Unidentiﬁed SpeakerScott?
Yes. Thanks. Scott Mushman[ph] from Wealth Research[ph]. Kind of an extension of
the last question. You know, obviously, the First Quarter was tough throughout the
businesses. So it's actually to all three of the operators. You know, as we look towards
the end of the year, what materially changes to make you a little bit more optimistic?
I mean, if I looked at Sam's business, I would think your small; and medium-sized
businesses are probably petriﬁed by the Aﬀordable Care Act. They don't know what
their expenses look like. How are they going to go out and, you know -- you know,
up their spending into that?
I look internationally. Most of the economies you're dealing with are actually slowing
down for the most part. Then I look domestically. And we're not really seeing any
improvement in the mid; to low end. I mean, you look at the jobs report. I mean,
everyone's cheering. But you need 200,000 jobs just to keep steady with the people
entering the job market.
So I'm just trying to understand where the optimism comes across the businesses as
we get to the back half of the year into '14.
You know. So I'll start oﬀ with that question. So for Sam's we have sort of a
bifurcation with our membership. So we do have that higher household income and
then we have that business member that's stressed.
So for us, the equation is, we're -- we're investing in price right now to make sure that
we're meeting our members where they need to purchase. The second part of that,
though, is that we're adding to our merchandise portfolio. And so we're adding
exciting merchandise just coming into the clubs in May. And that's adding to some
of the growth on our -- on our higher-end member.
The other piece is we just entered this new membership fee. While that is a
membership fee increase, we also introduced the new instant savings book at the
same time. And we're getting good feedback from that. And so we feel like we're
responding to where our members are and -- and in delivering great price, value
and good merchandise. And our merchandise shift is what -- is -- we're accounting
for in the second half of the year.
And our business in the US stores, three -- three factors drove virtually all the miss to
our projection in the First Quarter. A substantial portion of it came in the ﬁrst two
weeks of the quarter. And that was in the income tax refund checks. We don't --
clearly don't project that to continue.
The next big chunk came in really, really unusual weather anomalies, ﬂips in weather
year on year, whether -- we certainly don't project and hope -- maybe hope -- maybeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 18 of 30don't project it to be 20 degrees colder this summer than it was last summer. Keep
your ﬁngers crossed.
And -- and the third was a variance in inﬂation to our projection by about 60 basis
points, which was responsible for about 60 basis points of our -- of our comp miss.
And that would probably be the one that will continue, although we expect that to
abate a little bit in the back half.
And so if you take those three factors, two of them which we don't expect to occur,
one of them which we expect to improve. And you put it up against more favorable
comparisons for us in the back half of the year leads us to a pretty optimistic back
half.
From an international point of view, I agree with you. I don't see the economies in
the back half of the year getting substantially better. And there have been some
things that surprised us. And we got surprised in China in the ﬁrst part of the First
Quarter. We were expecting a much stronger Chinese New Year. And the latter two
weeks of the event really fell oﬀ. And we saw a lot of softness in the market that we
weren't planning on and weren't able to get expenses out fast enough to be able to
react to it.
Lately, Mexico has been surprisingly soft. I think if you look at our numbers
(inaudible) it tells you that that's actually happening and didn't have that in the plan
as we started the year.
Let's see. In terms of surprises, South Africa has been a little softer lately than we
expected it to be when we built our plan. The other markets are tough. But we knew
they'd be tough. I mean, it was nothing going to drive growth in the U.K.. And our
plan reﬂects that.
Of the good news is, across the markets, we're taking share. We're taking share in
the overall -- in most of our markets. We're taking food and consumable share in
China. We're taking food and consumable share in Brazil. And I think from a relative
point of view, we can outperform.
And what we've got to deliver on is getting more expense out of our business so
that we can deliver the bottom line and drive the return improvement that we
expected when we began the year. It's hard to do that in some of our international
markets. We don't have all of the disciplines in place, in terms of process and
systems that more developed markets have.
We have some wage inﬂation that's putting pressure on us. And we're seeing about
10% wage inﬂation in China, 9% in Brazil. And even Mexico has got about 5% wage
inﬂation. In most of the markets, the wage inﬂation is outpacing product inﬂation.
And in some cases, they're union contracts and we're not able to adjust what the
hourly wage rates are. So we've got to get more hours out of our business to be able
to deliver leverage.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07

Page 19 of 30Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Bill Simon
Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantSo we didn't anticipate Mexico to be as sot. And you probably know, if you look at
the division, Mexico, the U.K. and Canada are driving most of our proﬁtability. And
with the bad weather we had in Canada, the market situation in the U.K.. And now
this softening in Mexico, it puts the pressure on the division.
So we just need to -- to get all the things in place to be able to get our costs down.
And it's a little diﬃcult to do in international with as much speed as we'd like. But
we're making progress on that.
So the First Quarter last year was our strongest quarter. I think on a reported basis,
our proﬁtability grew by around 20%. The comparisons get easier in the back half.
And if we can get those expenses out. And that's what we're focused on doing, I
think our quarter's performance will go through the year. But it won't be because the
economies are getting better.
If I could follow up with Bill just quickly -- and thank you for those answers, they were
great -- inﬂation, competition, we're hearing a lot more news from people that
compete against you. Hi. we have to invest back in price. I think it was said up here,
Sam's is going to invest back in price. You mentioned you think inﬂation will actually -
- the deﬂation, really, what we're seeing will ebb. What gives you that conﬁdence?
Then on the US consumer, are you seeing any better -- you know, paycheck cycle
that's making you feel a little bit better about what's going on in the low end? Then
I'll yield. Thank you.
{BIO 1907361 <GO>}
Just for clarity, I think we all use inﬂation a little bit diﬀerently. You know, commodity
inﬂation is what -- I think what we're talking about. Then the inﬂation that -- what I was
trying to describe in the First Quarter was the inﬂation compared to what we
projected in the plan, not -- not inﬂation rising or lowering.
I don't think we'll miss our inﬂation projection as badly in the second half as we did
in the ﬁrst half, not that it'll change substantially in either direction, there doesn't
appear to be anything from a commodity pressure change that would -- that would
impact inﬂation. We see some growth in beef and produce pricing. But that's oﬀset
in our -- in our business by dry grocery. That's ﬂat to slightly deﬂating in certain
areas.
And so two of those things from a commodity perspective may or may not -- we
don't expect those to change. But what we expect to get better is our projection
against those to the plan in the back half.
And the second part, I forgot, again?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07

{BIO 15745016 <GO>}
Hi, it's Jason DeRise at UBS. So I wanted to ask questions about e-commerce. But it
really relates to multiple parts of the business. So ﬁrst, I guess, the $10 billion versus
$9 billion. Where did the surprise come from that led you to opt that? Obviously, it's
maybe rounding, that it's only $9 billion to $10 billion. But which divisions maybe are
surprising positively?
So as we said, it's accelerating growth pretty much across the board. So we're taking
share in every market in which we compete. So Brazil is very strong. China is strong.
The US is strong, as well as the addition of Nihaodiyen, which wasn't in our -- wasn't
in our original expectations. So it grew over 30% in the First Quarter. And the vast
majority of that was accelerating -- accelerating growth.
{BIO 15745016 <GO>}
Then when you think bigger picture, which of the divisions do you think will beneﬁt
the most in terms of sales uplift? I mean, obviously, the US is very large. So I don't
mean in absolute dollars. I guess I mean in % of the business, where could you see
the biggest uplift?
You know, I'd tell you genuinely we're pretty excited about all three. So the work
we're doing at walmart.com is pretty substantial and very exciting. So every time we -
- we give the customer good -- an additional good product, we -- we sell more of it.
So traﬃc is very strong. We've doubled assortment in the ﬁrst half of the year. And it
looks like we'll be doing more in the second half of the year, which is driving a fair
amount of growth.
On the international side, China is obviously very strong. Latin America is very strong.
It's a great e-commerce market and a very good market for us. So we're really
excited. We're growing over twice the rate of the market there.
Then Ros and I are both extremely excited about the prospects for Sam's Club going
forward. We can deliver an integrated member experience with e-commerce as a
core element of that and truly diﬀerentiate Sam's Club from -- from its normal
competitor, obviously, Costco. But also as we jointly compete against traditional e-
commerce competitors.
So I don't want to sound all rosy. But we're really very excited about -- about all three
of the areas, because we believe that the tide is rising, we believe that we have the
capabilities, as Mike indicated, the talent necessary to really make a diﬀerence. And
you're starting to see it in the results.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07

And in terms of --
{BIO 3510931 <GO>}
I was just going to say, I think in the future, you can think about e-commerce as just --
if you're in retailing, it's the air we breathe, because I like to think about all
commerce will be e-commerce. So customers shopping in a store, buying produce,
buying apparel, or buying online, or in a Sam's Club, or anywhere in the world, e-
commerce will just be like the air we breathe.
{BIO 15745016 <GO>}
Okay. Then the last part of this is payback period, again, if -- do you think that it will
be diﬀerent than your online competitors, where the payback period may be a
decade away? I mean, no one really knows what the main online competitor thinks
will be the long-term proﬁtability there. Is that something that's just the cost of being
relevant and -- or is there something you could share that maybe in ﬁve years we'll
see proﬁt from it?
Yes, I'd say -- I'd say the fundamentals of the business are going to be as follows.
We're going to grow faster, obviously, than the rest of the business. And probably
materially faster than the rest of the business. We'll probably settle at a slightly lower
operating margin than the rest of the business. And we will deliver a higher return on
investment.
So even as you look at the projects, Mike walked you through how we approve real
estate, is we think about the fulﬁllment networks we're building, they're all high ROI
investments for us. So that -- that will yield -- yield real results. And so think of that
business model as faster growing top line, slightly lower operating margin. And
higher return on the capital that we're deploying there.
As opposed -- as far as when I'll let the boss answer that question if he doesn't like
what I say. But I think as long as we keep growing, we're going to keep investing. So
it's a great, big market. It needs to be taken by somebody. And we're in a position to
take it. And so as long as we can prove that the business keeps getting better, we'll
continue to invest in it.
{BIO 3510931 <GO>}
Being an engineer, I don't like to take completely diﬀerent geographies and models
and blend them all together and come up with one answer. So a market like China,
where there's just an amazing opportunity in terms of the scale and growth, Latin
America, we were talking about yesterday, as -- or compared to the U.K. market. So
markets will be diﬀerent in e-commerce, like they are in retail.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07

{BIO 15745016 <GO>}
Can I just follow up? Sorry, I'm extending this out for everybody. Sorry. But is it fair
that maybe the US, that is where it's really extended out, because of who your main
competitor is and what margins they're willing to operate at? Or is that not the right
way to think about it?
{BIO 3510931 <GO>}
I'm not sure that is, because we think about it as, how was it -- how do -- because our
business is already a very established business. And it becomes a complementary
opportunity to the business we already do in the United States. So I really like to
think of the advantage we already have with the 4,000 stores of 600 clubs and all
the points of distribution that we already have in our infrastructure that allows us,
then, to have a diﬀerent model than the particular competitor you might be referring
to.
Mike, may I add one thing to that? Which is you heard us say two things. One
customer, one Wal-Mart. So we're serving a customer who wants to shop at Wal-
Mart, whether they want to shop with us online, on their mobile device, or in one of
our stores. And we collectively can do things that others can't do.
And still, I'm the Internet guy. And I will -- I will acknowledge that 90% of commerce
is not done online today. So pulling those two things together in a way that no one
else can is our new vision for commerce, just like the integrated member experience
at Sam's delivers for the Sam's members something that Sam's traditional
competitor can't do.
So thinking holistically about how we grow the whole pie, as opposed to try and split
between the two of them, is our focus, because at the end of the day, there's one
customer. And we want to serve her better than anyone else in the world.

shared services. And that includes both ﬁnancial. It can include shared services
relative to H.R. Just a lot of diﬀerent opportunities.
What we're learning around the world is we're more similar than what we realize.
And that back oﬃce capability is -- is a real opportunity for us. And we're going to
take full advantage of it.
Just think about engineering. You know, in some of our markets, we have not had
good process discipline. And what Rollin and I together in the international area
have been working on is -- is having thought leadership be global. But have the
capabilities in markets from an engineering point of view to really deliver on
process.
And it's process ﬁrst, followed by system. It creates maturity. And in some of our
markets, in some cases because integration work hasn't been completed, we've got
to do some of those things ﬁrst so that we can get to a more advanced level of
operation.
We've been calling it a maturity model. And we're trying to move everybody up the
maturity model. And that'll take a while. It'll show up in associate wages. It'll show up
in inventory. It'll show up in lots of places as we do it. It's pretty holistic, actually. It's
just a process of moving them up that curve as fast and as well as we can.
And Doug, do you think -- over time, do you think store formats globally will start to
converge? Or do you expect to maintain this variance you're seeing in the
international (inaudible)
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
There may -- you know, it's interesting. I hadn't thought about it very much. But there
could be some convergence. I mean, the Internet and e-commerce is going to
change everything in a -- in a huge way across the whole world. And as we thinkFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantabout stores, people are still going to want access to pick up some things. We think
of fresh food ﬁrst. But that could go anywhere the customer wants it to go, with our
logistics capabilities over time.
And this discount compact hyper format is the ﬁrst one that comes to mind. You
know, we've taken that Mexican format to Argentina successfully. Chile has
something like that. That's one to keep an eye on as we think about the future,
because it's got such a low cost of operation. It's (inaudible) others to talk about the
importance of local relevance.
And the key is to integrate the back end. Well I still feel that's true. But when you
think about how the customer's going to view Wal-Mart over time around the world,
there probably will be some convergence towards the Wal-Mart brand, as well.
At the US, we've worked -- we're working on some -- continuing to work on some
process engineering things, little things that make -- amount to big dollars. And
we're starting to work on some big things. We've always had some big projects
underway.
And one of the things that's fascinated me always is just how absolutely productive
our supply chain is. So if you tour our DCs, you see some incredible, incredible
management of inventory. And yet when that truck backs up to the dock of a store
and opens the gate, the inventory in the story in the back room doesn't look at all
like the inventory does in the distribution center.
And imagine if you could have the same order and discipline from an inventory
management standpoint in the back room of the store, where you have more square
-- warehouse square footage and more inventory dollars in the back room of our
4,000 stores as you do in our DCs, you can unlock an incredible amount of value
from working on a project like that, which is a big, big number to crack.
Thank you.
{BIO 2078735 <GO>}
We'll go to Mike ﬁrst.
Just going to follow up on the distribution point that Bill was making and for the
broader team, as well. One thing we saw in the distribution center yesterday is that
the dot-com fulﬁllment is now going through Carrolton primarily before it comes to
the local DC. When do you see the opportunity to more fully integrate the inventory
management at the DC level?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 26 of 30A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Unidentiﬁed SpeakerBecause it would seem like if you're able to get to the stage where vendor product is
sourced directly to each of your DCs that are in place now, sort of indiﬀerent, that it
would greatly enhance productivity and leverage.
I mean, I'll start. And then I'll kick it over to Neil. You know, I sort of envisioned this
world one day from a supply chain where you have a small store that's connected to
a compact discount hyper like Doug talked about that's connected to a large super-
center that's connected to our traditional DC that's connected to a dot-com
fulﬁllment center that's a center that has everything.
So the SKUs the customer wants more frequently and most often is closest to the
customer. And everything is wired and connected by e-commerce from our small
store to our medium store to our large story to our traditional DCs to the endless
and limitless SKU assortment that's available through dot-com fulﬁllment.
And if you can connect all that powerfully from a supply chain perspective and from
a customer perspective, through -- through e-commerce and the Internet huge
opportunity for eﬃciency and the delivery of the customer, whatever they'd like.
And Neil they're starting to work on dedicated e-commerce facilities that will allow
us to expand the assortment at a much, much faster rate and get to most of the US in
two days.
And Bill describes the vision of that next-generation fulﬁllment network excellently.
And just think about the ability for those aegis[ph] facilities to feed into our existing
transportation network. So those packages get to -- get to either our store. But since
we have stores near every customer in America, it means we have trucks going near
every customer in America. And the highest cost part of distribution of e-commerce
is in the shipping.
So it's this -- it's this multi-variant node network that Bill describes which delivers
signiﬁcant value directly to the home for e-commerce and directly to our stores, as
well.
If I can add, sitting on a platform and an infrastructure that gives you capability and
visibility across that whole network. Then once you get that, then you achieve that
optimization of merchandise movement around the network.
I guess just to follow up, if you think about it in terms of innings in a baseball game,
are we talking sort of third or fourth inning today? And also, is the right long-term
solution to have dedicated dot-com DCs? Or is there a way to fully integrate those
with the stores and so forth?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantYou know, I don't know how to describe it as a baseball game with an end. I think
productivity improvement is endless. I think you can always be better.
So I would tell you we're both in the eighth -- seventh, eighth inning on certain
projects and certain things. And we're not -- we're not even in the bottom of the ﬁrst
in others. But I don't look at it that way. I don't know about you guys. I think once --
you know, we've gotten the most -- one of the most eﬃcient and eﬀective supply
chains in the business today. And so you could say, well, that's in the ninth. It's in the
second in certain areas. There's always an opportunity to improve. So I have a hard
time quantifying that.
Yes. This isn't a project. It's the company. So we are -- we are building this -- we are
building this network. And you should think of it as an organic entity that gets better,
as Bill described, every time we add another node to it. And as the customer asks us
to serve her diﬀerently, we're going to continue to add nodes to that network. And
we will always drive eﬃciency through all elements of that network.
{BIO 3510931 <GO>}
I've been around 30 years. And it's never -- never stopped. Every year, we can get a
little bit better.
I had a professor in college who said the best method will never be found. You just
keep ﬁnding better methods. And we'll keep ﬁnding better. But we'll never say that
we've arrived and now have -- so whether it's e-commerce or supply chain, we will
never get to the point where we say we've got the ﬁnal solution.
{BIO 2078735 <GO>}
Okay, we'll take two more questions. We'll go Scott. And then we'll go back to John
in the back.
I wanted to turn the attention towards the express format, if we could. It seems -- and
kind of dovetailing oﬀ the distribution issues -- it seems like this is -- the Expresses
I've visited, it's a unique format, really not one that exists in the US, with the gas
stations, the pharmacy, plus the food and -- so it's very unique, probably the ﬁrst
unique format introduced in a long time. Comps seem like they've very, very strong.
They are.
Investment in the box must be pretty de minimis. It's a small box, would be my
guess. And so how can you solve the logistics problem there? It seems like that'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 28 of 30A - Unidentiﬁed Speakerwhere the problem is. How do you do that and see maybe some explosive growth
out of Express?
Yes, I mean, it's been great for us so far. We've reported double-digit comps in the
stores that have comped. The rural stores are doing substantially better than the
urban stores from a sales and a -- and -- and expense employed[ph] in the rural
stores themselves are already proﬁtable, probably two years ahead of projection in
the -- so we're really pleased with them.
The supply chain is really interesting. And again, they're -- they are unique. And I
appreciate you -- you bringing that up, because they're a hybrid of a -- of a
convenience, a food, a drug. And a dollar store. And they can go close to the
customer.
And in that -- that in and of itself is very powerful, as we're ﬁnding out. The sales that
we're doing out of each one of those units are substantial. And we're pleased with
them.
But imagine if we could connect them like we were just describing to you with
everything that you want either an hour away, a day away, or two days away,
depending on where you are in the sequence. And that on your mobile device, on
your way to one of these stores in a rural market -- or maybe while you're not driving
-- but before you go to one, you can -- you can -- you go in there to pick up your
milk, your bread, your eggs. And your prescription. And you need a reﬁll on a
vacuum cleaner bag. And we're able to get that to that store by the time you get
there. So you can have the economics of a small store that exist, the CapEx and the
labor around a small store. But the sales of a much, much larger store, because we
have a supply chain and an e-commerce infrastructure that wires and connects the
whole thing to serve the customer.
And that's what we're trying to work on now. And we're going to talk a little bit more
in detail probably at the October analyst meeting about some of the things that
we're doing.
Express for us right now is in a density test. The initial pilot has been very well
received by the customer. We're pleased with it. The next phase for us was density.
And we went to a market in North Carolina. And we're building -- we'll end up with
about 20 of them or so in the ground, many of them clustered in a dense area so
that we can ﬁnd out and understand how they interact with each other, how they
interact with competitors in the market. And -- and then how many you might be
able to build before -- and you project them nationally.
We're going to do some things about playing with tethered distribution. And there's
some detail around that that we'll share with you in October. And once we've got all
that, I think we'll be able to move pretty quickly on those small stores.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-07

And our last question, John?
Leslie, since it's your last meeting, would you give us a little bit update on what's
happening in Washington and looking forward to the midterm elections, et cetera?
{BIO 2080433 <GO>}
Well I think as we all know in many ways, not very much is happening in Washington.
The town seems to be to -- continue to be consumed by issues that in a sense might
have been unexpected and not the core economic issues that either business or the
voter was focused on. Not to take anything necessarily away from the issues that are
currently in the headlines or currently under discussion. But I don't think they were
the issues that many of us would have thought kind of the agenda was complete
with.
You know, we continue to be lucky as a business. That doesn't depend on
government really one way or the other to clear the way for our ability to serve the
customer or to innovate. And so in that sense, it's very nice to be a business that
doesn't have to spend a lot of time in any arm of government in order to go do its
job. So we'll pay attention in Washington. But continue to keep our focus back home.
{BIO 2078735 <GO>}
And Mike, Charles, thank you for your comments upfront. The rest of you, the entire
team, thank you all for participating in the Q&A.
Bill mentioned a minute ago our October meeting. I would remind you that our date
is out there. We will be back here in Bentonville in October for our 20th meeting for
the investment community. The dates are dinner on Monday, October 15th. And
remember, we normally do Tuesday-Wednesday meetings. It is a change this year
that we are going Monday-Tuesday.
It'll give you a chance to travel in on Monday. We will have open houses in the
afternoon with dinner Monday evening. Then the meeting will run on Tuesday. As
always, we will ﬁnish up in the middle of the afternoon for those of you who have to
catch ﬂights out and be able to back home with your families for the evening.
So on behalf of Jeﬀ and me, our entire investor relations team, thanks again for
participating and for making the trip here to northwest Arkansas. And this concludes
our webcast.
