{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Well good afternoon, everybody. It's Karl Keirstead at UBS.
Super happy to have Microsoft keynoting the 2020 Virtual UBS TMT Conference.
Especially delighted to have Judson Althoﬀ here, who is the Executive Vice President
of Worldwide Commercial Business.
Judson can elaborate, but think of Microsoft as having a consumer element, a
commercial element. Judson essentially heads up the entire go-to-market eﬀort for
that commercial side. So a pretty critical role here.
In terms of format, we'll go for about 40 minutes. If any of you have questions, you
can use your question link. I can read them in front of me. Or if you prefer, you can
email me directly at karl.keirstead@ubs.com, and we'll take them that way.
So with that, Judson, thanks for carving out some time during your day to spend with
myself and our clients.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Absolutely, Karl. Thanks for having me.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes. Terriﬁc. Well, Judson, why don't we start with something near and dear to your
heart?
That's the sales eﬀort at Microsoft.
I think everybody sort of only knows that you took the organization through a sales
reorg about 1.5 years ago. But I feel like investors totally forgot about this because
the execution has been so brilliant that they assume that whatever you did was justFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-08

Page 2 of 15A - Judson Althoﬀtinkering, and it didn't really have any discernible impact because the results were so
phenomenal. But my guess is that there may be more behind the scenes. So it might
be a nice opportunity for you to describe the reorg, exactly what you did. And in
your judgment, how it turned out.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Sure. And thanks for the ﬂattering way that you set that up. I mean, high-level
perspective is we believe we're on a journey here, and we're working pretty hard in
our transformation, and we still have a long way to go to be the company we want to
be.
But yes, it's been several years now. But we had gone through a pretty major go-to-
market restructuring. And changing the model that 50,000 people to work in every
day is an interesting thing to do. Because much as you would note, we couldn't
exactly call up Wall Street and say, "Hey, could you all kind of look the other way for
a couple of quarters? Trust us, everything is going to be just ﬁne." We had to deliver
against our current long-range plan whilst eﬀectively changing the engines on the
plane and ﬂying it at the same time.
But we had ﬁve pillars to our approach that I'll cover brieﬂy because I know we have
a number of questions to get through in our short period of time.
The ﬁrst pillar was an industry pillar, to get laser-focused on organizing by industry.
In a period of time in the evolution of compute and the high-tech industry where
customers are trying to transform digitally, it was sort of an obvious direction to
become far more industry-aligned. Because if you want to help someone through a
transformation, you have to know their business well.
Digital transformation has to be business-led followed by technology. Technology
has to be the servant of that transformation. And so us getting deep across top
industries, the obvious ones, ﬁnancial services, health care, manufacturing, retail and
also the public sector as well. Super critical for us to realign our focus by industry.
We also had a tech pillar, which might seem obvious, but Microsoft pre-Satya and
sort of pre-transformation had really atrophied in a lot of our innovation. And Satya
was very quick early on in his CEO tenure to point out that ours is an industry that
doesn't respect any tradition but rather respects only innovation. And so we, Karl,
eﬀectively had to go back to school. We had to retrain a lot of our folks. We had to,
unfortunately, let go of a lot of sales overlay roles in exchange for hiring in
developers into our sales organization, our customer-facing groups, so that we could
eﬀectively roll up our sleeves and write code right alongside of our customers.
So there was a bit of a tech renaissance, if you will, by solution area. We compete in
our commercial sector in ﬁve main areas: The modern work technologies that you all
use each and every day; our business applications portfolio; the core apps and
infrastructure, think lift, shift, modernized to the cloud there; data and artiﬁcial
intelligence; and of course security, which underpins it all. But those ﬁve core areasFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-08
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 15A - Karl Keirstead
A - Judson Althoﬀfor us were areas where we had to retrain a lot of folks, hire in a lot of new folks, and
like I said, kind of go back to school.
The third pillar of it was to invest in a world-class customer success organization. You
can think of this as nonbillable consulting, people who live with the customer
beyond the deal. And in a consumption economy, which the cloud really is, these
roles are super critical because you have to do more than just sell in a design
concept, you have to help a customer really adopt cloud services and evolve. And
our customer success organization has been pretty critical to that evolution over the
last several years.
Last two pillars. Fourth one seems like a means to an end, honestly, when we did it.
But now I am wickedly grateful for the investments we made here because with the
pandemic, it has served us incredibly well, and that is to roll out what we call a digital
sales force.
We see the ﬁrst three things I mentioned are pretty expensive to do. Organizing by
industry is the best way to talk to a customer, but it's the most expensive way to talk
to a customer. Hiring developers into your sales force are expensive assets. And
nonbillable consulting, well, implies that you're not making money on those
resources. So expensive things to do with your higher-end clients.
The only way to oﬀset that was to get a digital sales engine, connecting our digital
marketing to our digital sales resources, having a system feed qualiﬁed and
intelligence-driven leads into our inside sales teams, providing next-best action, real-
time sales coaching, objection handling, all using our own tech to sort of feed the
machine was the way we address the scale needs of the business.
And then the ﬁfth pillar was reimagining our partner model, getting IP to run on our
platform that we would eﬀectively then represent and sell as if it was our own by
vertical. And so the power of like pulling on a health care ISP and say, "Hey, listen,
we're not only going to help you put your product on our platform, we're actually
then going to turn around and help you sell it and measure our people's success on
the same," has been hugely beneﬁcial to us.
So those ﬁve pillars of our transformation have really driven how we've restructured
the force. As you've noted, it's been a Herculean change management eﬀort. And we
thankfully have been able to deliver some pretty strong results at the same time.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
And then COVID hit, Judson. And I'm sure it ended up stressing everything that you
built. So maybe you could elaborate a little bit on how the commercial enterprise
through SMB sales motion suddenly changed with COVID, besides the obvious that
all your sales executives and reps are working from home. So how has COVID
stressed the sales motion at all at Microsoft?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-08
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 15A - Karl KeirsteadYes. Look, I think it's put pressure on all of us, frankly, Karl. And I would say that ﬁrst
up, we feel very privileged to be in an industry that is, frankly, one where you can just
ﬂick a switch and pretty well-run the business remotely. We can build the product
remotely. We can service our customers remotely. We can collaborate eﬀectively as
an organization remotely. And so we consider ourselves lucky.
And the way our business is shaped throughout it has been, again, pretty strong
throughout because we are basically the enablers of remote and digital work right
now. And we say that from a position of humility because, look, there are very, very
much some stressed industries right now, stressed segments. I think if we look at the
areas where we see a blemish in our business, it's because downstream of that,
there's a very stressed customer. And so we're super respectful of that and continue
to hope for a strong recovery once we get out of these pandemic conditions.
But that said, to be precise about the answer to your question, look, our folks have
been stressed on all ends of the spectrum, from rolling out remote work services,
voice/video capabilities, persistent chat, collaboration tools, to the security
requirements for the same because once you digitize everyone's work environment,
you inherently make it more vulnerable to cyber-crime. Sadly, bad actors haven't
slowed down during the pandemic. They've operated very opportunistically. So it's
kept our security folks on pins and needles, working with customers proactively and
reactively throughout the same.
And then eﬀectively enabling remote everything, remote customer engagement,
remote factory operations. And the internal operations themselves have had to
become 100% digital, much as I alluded to in that digital pillar. At ﬁrst we built it out,
we build out infrastructure and tools and capabilities so that we could call on the
breadth markets or mid-market customers and SMB, but now eﬀectively all selling is
digital selling.
And it's pretty cool the way it works. I mean, we queue up demand signals from all of
our digital marketing eﬀorts. The folks who work in our digital sales organization
basically get a queue of 100 phone calls they can make any given day. The cognitive
reasoning services tell them who to call ﬁrst, how to handle the objections. We have
sentiment analysis on the calls that customers allow us to record. So we know how
well we're doing and how well we're tracking towards meeting their needs. And so
we've been blessed with all of that.
And we're turning around and helping customers with the same because the
technologies that Microsoft uses internally are the very same ones we sell externally.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Got it. And Judson, what are you communicating to your army of sales folks about
the timing of a return to a more normal, call it, pre-pandemic sales motion, ﬂying and
dining again, back in the oﬃce? What's the internal Microsoft messaging about
when that is likely to happen? It's important because when giants like Microsoft start
returning to normal, it can be a cue in terms of when, broadly speaking, we might
enter some recovery scenario. So I'm just curious what you're doing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-08

Page 5 of 15A - Judson Althoﬀ
A - Karl Keirstead
A - Judson Althoﬀ{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. It's a great question. So look, ﬁrst and foremost, we are working with
governments around the world to adhere to local law and policy because, again,
Microsoft operates in over 150 countries. And there's not just one return-to-work
moment or return to the workplace moment, there are multiple.
And so I could have customers in Singapore, in India that are meeting face-to-face
with their Microsoft counterparts and managing the public health requirements
locally in accordance with the policy of the land. But here in our headquarters
environment in Redmond, Washington, we've stated that we will not open up our
corporate campus for normal operations until July. We've given our employees that
kind of a notiﬁcation just so that they can continue to prepare for a remote work
environment.
Interestingly enough, coming out of it, though, it's a fascinating data science
problem. And the beauty of what we've built with this Microsoft 365 platform, Teams
being the interface that so many people use in the enterprise, is that it all sits on top
of an elaborate graph database that we could mash up with other systems of record.
So like if you're in sales, we would mash up your productivity data with sales results.
If you're in engineering, we would mash up your productivity with code check-in and
check-out. And we can actually measure that 80% of our folks are as productive or
more so pre -- than they were pre-pandemic.
So we will use that data to rethink corporate travel, rethink corporate real estate.
We're encouraging our customers to do the same. And the cool part about it, as I
said, is you can be very data-driven in how you make those decisions.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes. That's super helpful, Judson. And maybe now I'd love to ask you a few questions
about the customer conversations you're having these days, what the environment
feels like. So maybe I'll open with a general question about how large enterprise
spending priorities have changed since COVID.
I think it's pretty obvious that the initial month or two were very much about enabling
remote access. So Microsoft obviously saw Teams usage spike, et cetera. But with the
passage now of eight months, where are we now, Judson, in November, December?
What does it feel like are the key priorities as your big customers are preparing for
2021?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. I'd say the two things that are really diﬀerent now than they were pre-pandemic
is just the overall sense of urgency and agility and the ruthlessness of how every
investment needs to come back to an impactful outcome, right? And look, any good
CEO pre-pandemic would have been saying, "Hey, look, newsﬂash, Judson, those
two things were super important all of the time, pandemic or not." But the criticality
of, I think, what everyone faces right now is placing increased focus on those twoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-08
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 15A - Karl Keirsteaddimensions. And there's certainly a lot of energy on how do we go faster? How do
we make sure everything we do is impactful? The frivolity of anything that was
interesting or nice to have is often cast by the wayside.
But one thing that's very clear is that technology is being seen as the answer to
pretty well any of the questions being asked about how to modernize. Like if it
looked remotely good to get out of your data center pre-pandemic, it looks really
good to get out of your data center now. If it looked interesting to digitize processes,
factory automation scenarios, connect your oT capabilities to IoT and simulate how
to improve manufacturing scenarios, if any of that looked remotely interesting pre-
pandemic, it looks very, very interesting now, because frankly, it's the only way to
operate. It's the only way to produce goods at scale.
And so we're seeing really increased focus on all of those eﬀorts. Our people are
extraordinarily busy helping customers across really three primary dimensions, I
would say, Karl. One is this notion of all of the back-end digital twinning as we call it,
modeling through data and machine learning any business process that can be
modeled or automated or done in a lights-out capacity, whether that be a factory or
a curbside pickup optimization model, huge bodies of work on building products
and running processes in a digital, lights-out capacity.
The second category is a bit of what I mentioned to you in terms of Microsoft's
internal use of digital selling and support. Again, I always say, if you're not engaging
with your customers in an omnichannel capacity today, you're probably not
engaging with them at all. And that's very much the case with the bulk of the work
that we're doing, whether that be proactive or reactive handling of customer
engagement, largely data-driven eﬀorts to achieve that.
And then the other category is the one I mentioned just a moment ago, which is the
productivity of the employee base and the empowerment of the employee base
through modern assets and measuring the same very analytically using insight
services. So those are sort of the three categories, and we've just added intensity of
increased agility and impact on bottom line results.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Got it. So maybe, Judson, we'll hit a little bit on one of those drivers around getting
out of your own data center faster because that would obviously be a signiﬁcant
positive for the party of Microsoft Suite that, as you're aware, tech investors put
undue focus on, which is Azure, given how central it is to you and Satya and the rest
of the team.
So Judson, where do you think we are in that evolution of, post-COVID, big
enterprises stepping back, deciding that they need to change their on-prem/cloud
mix, make it more cloud? So the planning, whiteboarding phase. And then some of
them have gone a little bit faster and have actually made deal commitments to Azure
or Amazon or whomever. And then the third step is those deals actually going live in
a way that it consumes compute/storage resources, and we on the outside actuallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-08
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 15A - Judson Althoﬀsee it in the form of Azure revenue. So where are we in that journey? Because that
would help frame what the Azure outlook might look like.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. I sort of liken these things to sporting events. And I would say if you're a hockey
fan, which is a three-period game, I'd say we're probably entering ﬁrst intermission,
sort of the end of the ﬁrst period, if you will. And I would say that the way I sort of
justify that explanation is as follows.
The ﬁrst movers have moved. The ﬁrst movers are actually starting to recognize scale
results associated with the investments that they've made. And if you are an e-
commerce platform today other than the Amazon ecosystem, you're likely running
those assets on Azure today and you're seeing the results. You're seeing it pan out in
terms of your top line revenues and the ability to scale enormously. And so we are
seeing customers that did move early realizing the gains and the impacts and the
promise of that cloud transformation.
There have also been a ton of learnings associated with that ﬁrst period. That's why I
kind of use the intermission term, if you will, because there is a little bit of a, okay, so
that was maddening and crazy and intense. What did we learn from it? And how are
we advising clients moving forward?
And things like enterprise control planes and audit and security capabilities that
more eﬀectively allow customers to gracefully look at that transformation and
actually even look at hybrid computing as an end state rather than a -- you're sort of
a step along the way in a journey. Hybrid is becoming an architecture that's here to
stay, which is good for us because look at Microsoft, we've been doing hybrid before
hybrid was cool or even called hybrid. And so lots of work going on there today.
And I would say in terms of where you look at future growth coming from that, we're
at a point where there's some very consultative ways in which we're engaging with
customers right now, based on our learnings, that excite us about our portfolio and
our unique diﬀerentiation around sort of what will be the second and third chapters
of growth in the cloud.
And it starts probably with a less than obvious bit of advice that we extend to
customers these days, which is: Hey, look. There's probably a chunk of your
application portfolio that you shouldn't move to the cloud. Which, as a big purveyor
of cloud platforms, you go, "Well, that seems counterintuitive, Judson."
The reality of the situation is, if you look at where business processes are evolving
and you come back to this notion that technology should always be the servant of
the business, application obsolescence and letting go of some of those assets is an
important pressure point for opening up the economic ﬂywheel for future
innovation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-08
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 15A - Karl Keirstead
A - Judson AlthoﬀFrom there, there's also a portion of the portfolio that should not just be lifted and
shifted and modernized per se, but rather thought of in terms of new low-code, no-
code capabilities and infusing it into the way people do frontline work.
With Teams, we have the ability to integrate our low-code, no-code technology that
we call Power Apps so that end users can actually have a hand in designing the
workﬂow and the processes that they use to complete their task each and every day.
And that serves them productively far better than taking old school legacy, bespoke
applications and simply moving them to the cloud. Because look, if the application
didn't inspire productivity when it ran in your data center, it's not going to do any
better running in ours. And so that rethink on low-code, no-code capabilities,
modernized UI through Teams, super helpful.
We also then look at our Dynamics portfolio as a way of oﬀering up ﬁrst-party SaaS
applications that obsolesce legacy technologies at much lower cost. There's a
massive third-party ecosystem of SaaS oﬀerings out there, certainly some of which
compete with Microsoft at that biz apps layer but then also work on our cloud
platform.
There's a modern app dev revolution as well, a pro-dev revolution. And it's the
biggest reason why we acquired GitHub because we're seeing a tremendous
amount of momentum in that realm. There's the data and analytics estate that we
really have to help customers get in order because it's the foundation for innovation
and then the cybersecurity play.
So there's seven elements of a consultative, methodical plan not only helps
customers focus and accelerate their progress. It's actually quite diﬀerentiated
relative to our approach and the assets and the value that we can bring to the
discussion.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
That makes sense. And I appreciate the hockey analogy. You're talking to a
Canadian, Judson, so that hits home.
I've got two questions related to Azure. One is, in terms of Microsoft's
competitiveness relative to AWS and Google Cloud, do you think the COVID crisis
and these changes in enterprise priorities have in any way changed the competitive
dynamics among the big three cloud infrastructure vendors? Has it lent an
advantage to Microsoft in any way worth calling out to the group today?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. Look, I think the fact that Microsoft has had trusted relationships with these
customers for a very long time has helped. It's certainly in the mindset of a customer
who's had a fair bit of Microsoft infrastructure in place historically. When pressured
by upper management to say, "Hey, listen. We need to go to the cloud, and we need
to go to the cloud now. And so whichever direction you thought you were headed in,
please just go faster," that is beneﬁcial to us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-08
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 15A - Karl Keirstead
A - Judson AlthoﬀI think the investment we've made in hybrid capabilities also helps because it then
becomes not a zero-sum decision. In other words, it's not all in the cloud or all in
your data center. There is a logical conclusion that says there's a balance between
the two. And so I think our focus there has helped. The investment we've made in
data services that extend from what may have been your existing SQL server
investment with us into the cloud, also helping that journey.
And then the governance models that we have. Because Microsoft itself is a 45-year-
old company, and we've been through our own transformation, right? And as a result
of that, have built a lot of governance capabilities for how a Fortune 500 company
needs think about this kind of transformation. And so oﬀering that back up to
customers, I think, has been hugely beneﬁcial.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Got it. And maybe, Judson, maybe just to continue this discussion a little bit. The way
that some investors think is that the server product category that Amy and Mike
disclosed is often viewed as sort of the ﬂip side of Azure, where if big organizations
reduce their on-premise footprint and migrate those workloads to Azure, you gain
there, but you might lose a little bit on products like Windows server or SQL server
database that are on-premise. So do you think about it the same way? And how do
you manage that on-premise server product bucket to ensure that it can stay resilient
as large customers like UBS migrate more aggressively to the cloud?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes, it's a great question. I'd say the top line answer, Karl, is look, we're customer-
focused in terms of the outcome that they're trying to achieve. And so as a result of
that, there, of course, is some shift from on-prem to cloud, right? And we're not
trying to artiﬁcially dictate any of that. In other words, there's no on-prem meter
inside of Microsoft that says, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's not accelerate to the cloud
too fast because it's going to shift this business model." We want to go as fast as our
customers want to go.
And so inherently, there will be some shift, socket per socket, workload per
workload. In other words, if you had an on-prem workload that ran on a certain
number of Windows server and SQL server licenses in your data center and you're
moving them to the cloud and are moving that workload to the cloud, that, of
course, will be a shift. That stated, when I mentioned earlier that hybrid compute
architectures are here to stay, let me give you a little bit more of an example because
I actually think it's TAM-expansive. It's not 100% shift, but rather TAM-expansive.
Satya for a long time has talked about the intelligent edge, the intelligent cloud. The
latter, I think pretty well understood. The former, certainly confusing when it was ﬁrst
uttered. People were like, "What the heck is the edge? What do you mean?" And
people, I think understood the edge when you talked about a cell phone in your
pocket or maybe even a wearable or maybe to get their heads around an IoT center.
But increasingly, we're putting the ability to compute at scale and reason at scale at
the edge. We're increasingly making that a reality for customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-08
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 15A - Karl Keirstead
A - Judson Althoﬀ
A - Karl KeirsteadSo if you look at the announcements we've made on 5G and our Azure stack
capability, there are scenarios where reasoning at the edge and having compute at
the edge and then deciding when you round-trip to the cloud for model
propagation makes a lot of sense for customers, whether that be addressing
precision agriculture, where the idea that ubiquitous connectivity on the farm is just
not a reality, or whether factory operations in locations where you want to have a
private 5G network, right? Being able to reason at the edge will be an important part
of compute architectures moving forward.
Obviously, as we look outside the U.S., data sovereignty, data residency concerns will
further propagate the need for the edge as would defense and intelligence
scenarios need to dictate the same. And so you'll see, of course, growth of the cloud
organically. You'll see some shifting from that on-premise state on a workload-by-
workload socket basis. But you also will see TAM-expansive movement in those edge
compute scenarios. Hopefully...
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Hey, Judson, this might be unfair to ask you to quantify that. But if you had to think of
what hybrid means on-premise, cloud, edge, and you had to think out ﬁve to ten
years as to what the mix of a typical large enterprise spend might be, are you able to
bracket essentially what the end state might look like, call it, in ten years? Or is that
too challenging a task?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
It's super hard, and let me explain why because I'm genuinely not trying to avoid the
question. I'd love it if there was a yard stick or a meter.
But this gets to the belief that our opportunity is clearer than the total sum of the
high-tech industry opportunity as it is deﬁned today. There very much will be this
notion of digital COGS moving forward. The idea that, somehow, inside of a Kroger
grocery store compute capability because you're serving up ads at the shelf edge
and you're engaging with your customers with on-the-spot promotions as they're
walking through the store is a part of a COGS environment that does not exist today,
except in that Kroger example, does not exist at scale. And so as you see more and
more retail environments become truly digitized and truly omnichannel, as you see
more factories become digitized.
The number of factories on the planet that have full-on digital twins that can simulate
their operations at inﬁnite scale, drive down carbon, drive down cost, drive down
water consumption, it's probably less than 2% of the world's factories today. And so
that is edge expansion, TAM expansion that is pretty material right now because the
bulk of the way the world's industrial companies operate today is in a nondigitized
capacity. And so as we continue to learn about the applicability of those hybrid
intelligent edge scenarios, so goes the expansive nature of our TAM.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 15A - Judson AlthoﬀGot it. Maybe the last broadly demand question I'd love to ask you, Judson. Clearly,
Microsoft now, as most big enterprise software ﬁrms do, drives a huge portion of
your revenues from larger enterprises like UBS. But Microsoft in particular has a long
tail of SMB that are very big Microsoft customers as well. That, unfortunately during
this economic crisis, has been the -- that tail has been hurt. And Amy has been
candid on the last several Microsoft calls that, that the SMB sector has dragged
growth down a little bit.
I'm just wondering if you could address how Microsoft in the sales organization is
dealing with that SMB segment. And is there anything you can do from a sales go-to-
market motion to sort of bring that back? Or is it a function of, frankly, waiting for the
economy to improve and getting a snapback in that customer segment?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. It's a good one. The -- I think the ﬁrst thing to start with is what is SMB, right? I
mean, SMB is sort of the -- a segment of segments. And it's important -- I think I
always start with the basis of understanding where Microsoft competes in the
commercial frame, and frankly, where we don't and what is more of an extension of a
consumer base than anything else.
If you think about the very S of SMB, the very small of SMB, look, the bulk of our
commercial revenue is derived outside of that. And so if you think about companies
that are zero to ten in terms of employees, look, as I mentioned earlier, very humbly
stated and stated from the position of privilege, those folks are going through a lot
right now. And we have a lot of empathy for what those customers are experiencing.
That piece of our business looks a lot like our consumer business, though, more so
than it does our commercial enterprise business. And so whilst that very S of SMB
may be compressed, we're actually seeing pretty decent growth outside of that very
S of SMB, largely because, once again, if you thought it was a good idea to digitize
your business pre-pandemic, it's an imperative to do it now. No business is 100%
resilient, but digital businesses are more resilient than those that are not.
If you took a drive down the street and you look at the small businesses that are
open, it's largely because they ﬁgured out delivery. They've ﬁgured out relationships
with the DoorDashes of the world. And they've ﬁgured out a way to stay engaged
with their customers and make it such that their employees can continue to work
safely and remotely. And those that have closed shop have not. And again, with
some deliberate caution here and notion of privilege, we're the purveyors of what
makes all of that possible.
And so we, of course, are discounting quite a bit to support, just keeping those
entities aﬂoat. But as they continue to get through this pandemic and come out the
other side, we expect that sector of our business to thrive. And it's -- like I said, it's
growing today, maybe not growing quite what it used to pre-pandemic, but we're
bullish on the future.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-08

Got it. So Judson, we've talked a little bit about Azure, which is key to Microsoft story,
but the other product that's quite central that you and Satya have been talking a lot
about that's also increasingly in the conversation is Teams. So maybe I'd love to ask
you, Judson, two things. One is why is Teams so central to Microsoft? And then
secondly, a more timely question, and that's your interpretation of the Salesforce-
Slack merger and what it might mean for your Teams growth going forward.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. Great question. So we love Teams. And we love Teams for, I think, more reasons
than most understand. I think people get largely that Teams equals Slack plus Zoom.
Teams is both the voice and video capability and the persistent chat, sharing
capabilities that are inherent in Slack and in Zoom when you combine the two
together. We love it for that, but frankly, we love Teams for far more than that.
And we actually believe that Teams is the UX or user experience of the future. Teams
is the way in which people will want to work. It's not just about what you do in Teams.
It's about what you integrate into Teams and has the potential of eﬀectively being a
new Windows for us. Teams is cross-platform, completely open. It runs on any form
factor and the usability in the mobile form factor and the PC-class, large-screen form
factor, both are growing materially. And we're bullish about both. Like the App Store
ratings for the Teams app are oﬀ the charts in terms of quality.
And what that does, when combined with third-party applications as well as what we
call our low-code, no-code capabilities, Power Apps or our Power platform, is it
creates a new surface area for what we call the citizen developer. The person who
carries that mobile device around and goes, "Wow, I have to climb a telephone pole
or an electric pole to service this utility, and then afterwards, somehow write it all
down in a notebook and perhaps somebody transports it into an Excel document.
Gosh, if I'm savvy enough to make a PowerPoint presentation, I'm savvy enough to
make a simple app that can dock into my Teams environment so that I can digitize
the way in which I work." And this citizen dev movement is something that we are
cheering on, we are helping to propagate materially because we think Teams can
become that end user compute platform of the future.
We think it's pretty diﬀerentiated. The Slack acquisition by Salesforce, to give them
some credit, that was an intelligent thing to do because persistent chat is becoming
a modality. To think that you're going to have a CRM application, which is
Salesforce's core, that doesn't have chat capabilities in it would be arcane. And so
for them to have Slack as an asset to help that modality and their business
applications platform makes sense, so much so that it's exactly what we've been
doing for a couple of years now with Teams and our Dynamics oﬀering and
hundreds of third-party applications, as well as, like I said, there's no-code, low-code
capability that is so inherent in the citizen dev movement.

A - Karl KeirsteadGot it. But does a more muscular Slack under the Salesforce umbrella, more
resources, the ability to be upsold into the Salesforce base, does it, Judson, make
them a more formidable rival in the collaboration space?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes and no. It certainly makes -- it makes their own assets modernized if you think
about it. If you are a sales cloud user or a marketing cloud user or a service cloud
user and Slack becomes more integrated into those environments, it makes that
asset stickier for them, and certainly on the dynamics front, strengthens the
competitive dynamic between our oﬀerings and theirs.
But from a productivity play standpoint, Salesforce really doesn't have a broad-scale
productivity oﬀering. And I would oﬀer up -- and this is probably a Judson opinion
more so than a Microsoft opinion per se, but I will oﬀer up broadly that it actually is a
distraction because it takes -- like Salesforce is not going to be in the same kind of
sales pursuits that we are in when we're driving a workplace modernization or an
employee empowerment eﬀort with a customer.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Okay. And Judson, we don't have too much time for questions, but I did just get one
that is such a perfect segue from this conversation that I have to ask it. And that is --
I'll read out loud to you.
Do you see Microsoft getting more directly involved in enterprise telephony? Or will
you continue to lean heavily on carrier and UCaaS partners going forward?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes, it's a good question. We don't see that as zero sum, quite frankly. We had great
partnerships with the telco providers around the world. We actually see those
relationships strengthening. As they look to take their own network assets to the
cloud and modernize the same, our platform actually becomes more of the
plumbing for how telcos operate. Certainly in this edge cloud paradigm that I
described earlier, telcos are essential.
The voice and video payload will be something we perfect through Teams, and
telcos know that. It's not just a Microsoft thing, frankly. It's whether you use Cisco
WebEx or whether you use Zoom or BlueJeans or any other things that are out there
today, the idea that somehow that's going to be a telco oﬀering versus just
something that comes over the top is just a market reality. And I think the telcos see
that, and so they're looking to monetize outside of the core end-user experience.
So look, there's no successful Teams strategy or Microsoft strategy that excludes
telcos. In fact, we see the need for even stronger partnerships there moving forward.

question, Judson, just to keep you on your toes. An investor asking whether
Microsoft has any plans to create its own chip to compete with Apple's M1 chip, or
for that matter, do what AWS did and produce chips for the use in Azure VMs?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Well, yes. So we do have our hand in our own chip design already through Xbox.
And the xCloud oﬀering is actually a very interesting one that we're pretty excited
about. The gaming ecosystem is one of those crossover realms between consumer
and commercial that's super exciting for us and a high-growth area of the business.
I can't comment on what we'll do in the space. Apple's move was certainly a very
interesting one. We're studying it. The partnerships that we have, though, in this
realm, from the open AI eﬀorts that we have to our relationship with Intel and the
Arm developments that we have certainly point to the need to have advanced
capabilities here. Whether we build it ﬁrst-party or have an ecosystem of third-party
partners is sort of yet to be disclosed.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Excellent.
Judson, why don't we end it there?
Thank you, to you and Mike Spencer and the IR team for agreeing to keynote our
event and spend as much time as you have with our clients.
So on behalf of UBS, Judson, thanks so much for you carving out time today for us.
