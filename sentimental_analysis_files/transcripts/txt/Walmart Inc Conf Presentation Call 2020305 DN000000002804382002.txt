{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Good morning, everyone. I'm Michael Lasser, the hardline, broadline and food retail
analyst from UBS. We could not be more excited to have the team from Walmart with
us today. To my immediate left is Brett Biggs, the Company's Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Oﬃcer. He has been the CFO of Walmart since 2016,
and it's no coincidence that during this time, Walmart has crushed it. So we would
call that a direct correlation.
With Brett is other members of the team, including Dan Binder, who heads the IR
team; Kary Brunner, who also works on the IR team; and Chris Nicholas, who is the
CFO of the International business.
Walmart has some disclosures. They may read some forward-looking statements.
Please go to their website to have a full download of their forward-looking
statements.
So, with that, Brett, thank you for being here.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
My pleasure.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Really appreciate it. Over the last few years, Walmart has realized some sizeable
gains in various areas of its in-store execution, service levels, store appearance, in-
stocks. One question that constantly comes up is, have we reached a maximum
threshold of the improvements that can be gained? Or is there more room to go?
And what are the biggest areas of opportunity?

Brett BiggsYeah, thanks for having us, by the way, and thanks everybody in the room and on the
webcast. Thanks for your interest in Walmart.
Yeah, it's interesting, when you go back -- I was even going back and reviewing
notes of when I've been here in the last two or three years and the things we weren't
talking about three years ago that we're talking about now, and how quickly things
are changing. Four years ago, we really weren't talking about that much about online
grocery, which has become a big part of who we are. The customers now -- I talked
about in our Analyst Meeting, technology advances and process investments we've
made with Ask Sam and Sam's Club and pickup towers and FAST Unloaders in the
back room, and really none of those things we were talking about two or three years
ago. So, there's a lot of things that have happened. Therefore, I know, things will
continue to happen inside the business.
And looking at where we need to be ﬁve years from now, the things that we need to
be working on, we're working on. So we've talked about initiatives like AlphaBot that
we're testing not far from here in Salem, New Hampshire, and the beneﬁts that can
bring to our line grocery business in the future and technology changes that I'm
seeing in supply chain, which will be big in the coming days. We continue to put a lot
of emphasis toward initiatives in the store that will help with associate productivity.
Ask Sam is one of those, we talked about that at our Analyst Meeting a couple of
weeks ago, where associate can talk into an app and ask them where it is, where is
this item located, where is it in the back room, and they can easily ﬁnd that. So
there's all kinds of things that we're doing. I think we've just started. Feels like we've
come a long way in the last ﬁve years on how we're dealing with associates, how
we're dealing with customers. But the technology and the process changes that I see
inside the Company and the innovation mindset that is inside the Company, I think
we've only kicked the tires where we're going to go.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And presumably, there is a momentum element to it. Once you start down that path,
that trajectory can pick up and it becomes...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
People learn how to do -- they learn how to learn. They learn how to be innovative.
New people in the Company, people who have been in the Company a long time,
they are learning to work in a diﬀerent way, which is a great combination that we
have.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
I love Brett because you can tell how conﬁdent he is, in part by his body language.
And this next question...

Brett BiggsI am conﬁdent. That's good.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Yeah, without a doubt. And once -- I've seen Brett talk about the levers in the
Walmart business about a half a dozen times over the last couple of years. And every
time he talks about them, he emulates the process of pulling levers. It looks a little
bit like a dad dance when he does it. It looks like me doing TikTok with my daughter.
But the important point...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I try to stay oﬀ of TikTok.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Well, that's probably a good thing. But the important point is, he just shows how
conﬁdent that he is in these levers that can be pulled to run the business. So are you
seeing any diminishing eﬃcacy of these levers that you talk about? Maybe if you
could expand on those levers and how powerful...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Now, I have to do the levers, right? I have to do the levers.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
You do -- you could remember it every time.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. When you go back and look at -- go back ﬁve years ago, and just one example
of the levers, let's look at SG&A leverage. And if you go back ﬁve years ago and you
look at where we're at today, and we've taken (inaudible) exactly how you measure
(technical diﬃculty) everything that 70 basis points or 80 basis points oﬀ of that
number. And that's a big number. On a $500 billion business, you're talking about
$3.5 billion or $4 billion of diﬀerence from an expense to sales ratio.
Some of that's been great sales. We've had good comps in the US, really good
comps internationally, and so that's the best way to get expense leverage. But we,
this last year, would have been just over 20 basis points of leverage. We'll say, we'll
do that again next year. I feel conﬁdent about the ability to do that kind of year after
year for a little while so we can keep sales comps where they're at. But there are so
many diﬀerent pieces to the business. And when Doug and I and the team get
together, we spend a lot of time talking about how to make all the pieces ﬁt
together. And there's a lot of diﬀerent ways that we can get to where we want to get
to. We can sit here and look three or four or ﬁve years out where we want to be.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-05

Michael Lasser
Brett BiggsAnd there's people like (inaudible) how are you going to get there. There's just a lot
of diﬀerent ways that we can get there. There's -- look at international, there's
diﬀerent countries there. Some are growing more quickly than others. Look at what
we're doing in e-commerce and omni-channel, and it's almost hard to explain the
calculus that we go through as a team in setting our priorities. But knowing that
here's where we want to be 5 or 10 years from now from a strategic standpoint, but
we need to have that make sense from an investor standpoint as we go through a
period of time, and that's the math that we go through.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And I think the perception again from outside observers is, these levers include,
look, if you're not seeing the traﬃc, you can push a little bit more on price. If you're
not seeing the conversion, you can push a little bit more on the in-store experience.
If you're not seeing online where you want it to be, you can push a little bit more on
online. Conversely, you can pull back on those levers. Is that fair?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. And it's -- a couple of great examples. Several years ago, when we -- we had a
decent-sized e-commerce business. We've made some big moves with the
acquisition of Jet a few years ago and then with Flipkart. And so, you know you're
going to have increased losses from e-commerce, and we've talked about that. But
as we were doing that, we had made investments years before in wages and
productivity and other things inside the US stores that started paying back in order
to be able to do that. If you look at this year, we've said next year, we're going to
lean in a little more to technology. We want to accelerate some of the things we're
doing around technology. And you can do that because we believe losses in e-
commerce will be ﬂat to down a little bit, and we continue to believe in -- Sam's
business is doing well and Walmex is doing well and US stores are doing well. That
allows us to lean in a little more in technology. And it's just making all those pieces ﬁt
together. But if you sit in one of our meetings -- one of our executive meetings and
you look around all the assets that we have around the world and the ﬁnancial
strength that we have, it's a pretty fun place to be actually. It gives us a lot of options.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
One of the key themes at the Analyst Meeting from a few weeks ago was the level of
innovation that's coming from Walmart, and you just touched on that in your last
answer. So can you give us some speciﬁcs about where this innovation is coming?
How are you going to be deploying it to the stores? How is that going to manifest
into the P&L over the next several quarters and years?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, I think that -- well, Walmart has always been pretty innovative. Maybe you can
go back to things that don't seem all that innovative today, but go back to when we
went into groceries, we turned a discount store into supercenter, which turned out to
be the greatest retail format in the history of the world, and some of the things we'veFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 18Michael Lasser
Brett Biggs
Michael Lasser
Brett Biggsdone internationally and what we've done in e-commerce now. So it's not like that
culture hasn't been there. I do think, Doug, when it came in six years ago now, really
ramped that up. And acquiring Jet several years ago, I think, ramped it up again
because you bring in diﬀerent types of talent, and you need to bring in a bit of a
diﬀerent mindset of how you attack business in a diﬀerent way. And so, I think all of
those things are true.
When I look ahead, we're going to continue to invest in technology, and there'll be
things in the back-end that no one will ever see, but it will make us more eﬃcient.
There will be things from a store productivity standpoint that'll just make jobs easier.
Associates will like jobs better with tools that we give them to ﬁnd things more easily
[ph] and make their jobs better. But I think the thing that will be the most interesting
in the next 5 or 10 years is how the retail environment changes, particularly in-store.
We'll do things online. The site experience will be better. But there'll be things that
you'll see in the stores. I think, 5 to 10 years from now, we'll be talking more about
Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality that keeps the store experience fresh, keeps it
interesting, keeps it exciting. You come into the store and you may see things --
could be wearing headset, may not be 10 years from now. I don't know. But you
could -- things that are jumping out at you in the store that make it easier to ﬁnd your
way around the store, to make products more interesting and the product details
there, and almost all your store becomes -- it feels like a website almost. And I think
those kind of things will be coming from a store perspective that will continue to get
traﬃc in stores.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
There is a portfolio of innovation that's coming out of Walmart from those examples
you mentioned to delivering fresh groceries into the refrigerator of people's homes.
So how does the Company ensure it's sequencing all of this properly? There has
been a pretty powerful example of how it rolled out online grocery over the last few
years to ensure it got it right. So is that the cadence that we should think about in
terms of innovation coming to the stores?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, it's interesting, when we announced that we were eventually going to have
groceries going straight into people's refrigerators, I do -- sometimes I got onto
Twitter and looked at comments...
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
You've got to be careful with that.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, I understand. But it was interesting, no, that's never going to happen, no, no,
no. But it wasn't just us. There were competitors that came out after us and did the
same thing, and the same thing, no, no, no, nobody is coming into my house to do
that. But what you ﬁnd out is, once people do that, for the most part, they're comingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-05

Brett Biggsback. You're -- they like that. They like the convenience. Think about the things we do
with our phone today, no one would have ever thought about that. No one would
have every thought about getting into a stranger's car and driving around the city.
So people get used to things. And once they get used to it and you make things
simple for them, they're going to want to do that.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
When we ﬁnd something like online grocery that was a test -- going back several
years, it was really just a test in San Francisco, and then a little bit more of a test in
Denver six years ago. The speed with which we rolled that out was pretty
exceptional. It's not as easy as it sounds to operationalize a store to do that. And it
was one of those ones where -- I think we had some idea obviously what the ﬁnancial
-- how the ﬁnancials will work on that, but the customers liked it so much and we
knew there would be such a halo around that for our brand, we just had to roll it out.
I think we're getting better at that. There's some things with technology. And Suresh,
our new CTO that came in, will see things -- sees what we can do as a company, and
we have great technology people to begin with, said, okay, here is some things I see.
Let's go. Let's accelerate this, and we do that. At the same time, I think we're getting
better about being quick to stop things. We've exited for the most part our business
in Brazil. We exited our banking operations in international. There's a lot of things
that we've done. And there'll be other small initiatives that we would have stopped
that we've never seen. We're stopping things much more quickly than we did in the
past.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And that seems like a change in mindset.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It is.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Historically, Walmart might have been maybe a little bit more conservative. It needs
to be proven and proﬁtably proven in order for it to really be initiative. Now it's, hey,
let's do it. The customer likes it. We'll ﬁgure out how to make money on it down the
road. Is that fair?

Michael LasserTo some degree. I deﬁnitely want to know where the proﬁtability is coming from. But
it's also not even just -- so in the past, you would have looked at, I think, initiatives on
a more discrete basis and said, is this initiative A, B, C and D going to be proﬁtable?
Now, you've got to step back and say, from an omni-channel perspective, is this
going to work from a return on investment standpoint? That's where -- I know it
frustrates you and others of your friends, but it make -- it's more diﬃcult to sit here
and say, this piece is proﬁtable, this one loses money because we're looking at it
from a customer standpoint and I'm looking at the total. That's really what I'm
looking at.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
One of the questions that constantly come up now are, well, you've rolled out online
grocery to a lot of your stores. You're still expecting signiﬁcant e-commerce growth
in the year ahead. Can you get those mature locations to continue to grow in a way
that will drive the overall business? Because the perception had been that you were
just getting the e-commerce growth from opening new sites.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, there is some of that for sure. You have a growth curve on any kind of new
initiative like that. We're getting the sense of the growth curve as we see some stores
now going into the fourth year.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And they're still growing.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, still have several hundred more we're going to open, so there's still growth
coming from that. And now that you get stores in the third or fourth year, you're
getting a sense of demand and how do you better operationalize that. How do you
pick in a way that's less impactful to people that are in the store? The test I just
mentioned, you've got [ph] AlphaBot, how do you get better process and
technology in the back end to make it more eﬃcient and you can get more
throughput in a store? How do you incent customers to maybe pick up at a diﬀerent
time? And so you change the demand curve by the time of day, and we're -- and
we've technology and everything that we're putting toward that, that will continue --
the idea is to continue to let those stores grow at whatever rate that the customer
wants them to grow, and also getting more general merchandise into that basket.
And we're adding items all the time into that basket. We're collapsing the apps or
combining the apps, which we've talked about, general merchandise app and the
grocery app, so all those things to try to get the mix where we'd like it to be long
term as well.

Brett BiggsAnd in some of those most mature, most legacy locations, are you still seeing
adoption, new people come into the fold? What's taken them so long?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
When you -- as you get the growth curve, you see less new adoption, but you get
people that are new into the area. And yeah, there's still people that maybe they
need to hear from four of their friends that it's good and not three of their friends...
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Old habits, they're hard to break.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. And the fact that we can -- I think as we keep bringing more general
merchandise into the fold, as our website gets better, it just makes people more
aware of the brand. There's still a lot of room, particularly in the US, for Walmart to
grow. There's a lot of share available for us.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And how does the curve look, in your perception, once (inaudible) of adding more
general merchandise into the mix, particularly as you combine those apps? Does
that create a whole new slope because of the expansion of the assortment?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. It's an opportunity to get some sales that you weren't getting in certain
categories. I think importantly as well, it helps you get a diﬀerent margin mix, which
is more proﬁtable for the business. Part of the reason the supercenter worked was
that you're going to drive traﬃc with grocery, which is still the case with a
supercenter, but you're able to mix it out because of all the categories which you
had around the box, and that's why the supercenter worked. And so, the ability to
get that supercenter assortment out into delivery and into online grocery is the
reason you want to do it. It's the same reason the supercenter was built.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And is there a risk over time as this becomes more successful, it's just going to draw
traﬃc towards your parking lot where people are driving through rather than coming
into the store and that is going to change the complexity, maybe even the margin
proﬁle of the business? Is that -- and how much consideration is that -- is being given
to that now?

Brett BiggsYeah, we're thoughtful about that. Essentially, you end up doing what the customer
wants you to do. And so, they're still saying that they want us to do that. I think versus
some of our competitors that are doing click-and-collect, our ability to mix up that
basket diﬀerently is really important, and a lot of our competitors aren't able to do
that. They just don't have the SKU assortment in the stores. But we've -- I think the
way we look at it is, we've got to go where the customer wants to go. It's our job as
the management team to make that work ﬁnancially. And again, we have a lot of I'll
do the lever thing, a lot of levers that we can pull to do that. But that's our job to
make sure that works, and it goes back to prioritization and other things we're just
talking about. We've got to be really disciplined to make sure that we can do what
the customer wants us to do.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
You're probably tired hearing questions about when will the digital losses continue
to go -- to diminish.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
So you're not going to ask?
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
I'm not going to ask. I'm going to ask, what are the factors that are going to be
driving that, which is I think a more important question rather than when.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. There's a lot of pieces to it. And we've had an e-commerce business for a long
time. We've had e-commerce business in the UK for a long, long time, over 20 years.
But as we bought Jet and now we've bought Flipkart, we're also continuing to learn
as an executive team. It's a diﬀerent business and what are the -- what's that model
look like and how can we inﬂuence it over time. And I think we have a good -- I have
a good feel for it. Several things impact that. You want to continue to have online
growth. It's important. E-commerce as a percent of market continues to grow, and
we want to -- we need to make sure we're growing, and we've grown it at nice rates.
You just kind of work down through the P&L, contribution, proﬁt margin to gross
margins and shipping with that is really important. E-commerce business is when you
get that contribution margin going in the right place, it can lever very quickly, much
more quickly even than a store can. So we're very focused on making sure we get
the right brands online, that we ensure that we're getting the mix that we want.
We've talked a lot about mix. We feel better about the mix than we did a year ago,
and that's why we made some of the statements that we did earlier this year.
We still need to do a little better job of managing ﬁxed costs. If you ask me one thing
that's probably been a little diﬀerent than I would have thought, I would have
thought we would have ramped on ﬁxed costs a little quicker than we have, and I'm
starting to see that now. So our e-commerce business, the growing contribution
margin rate, they are leveraging expenses. But when you look at the whole, it'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-05

Brett Biggsbecoming a bigger part of the business, and it changes the mix of the entire
business. But you just take e-commerce as a whole or just by itself, that's -- those are
the pieces really that make the most diﬀerence.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And does that conversation change as you can leverage technology more? You
mentioned the test of AlphaBot in Salem. It sounds like that's been a learning
process. It hasn't always gone as you anticipated. So maybe you can describe what's
happening and how this holds a lot of potential for the future because you could
automate it, make it more productive in a way that it would be a sizable change in
the business.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, it can. The technology we're seeing there can certainly add capacity to the
store and what we're able to do.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Maybe you want to describe what it is.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. And there's -- I would start with, there's still a lot of capacity for us to grow.
Even if AlphaBot never worked and we did something diﬀerent, there's still a lot of
capacity to grow just by some of the things we were talking about operationally and
move demand from diﬀerent parts -- times of the day. But what AlphaBot allows us to
do is to move items in the back end more eﬃciently than we can today. And just -- it
gives you a greater throughput back to the back end, then allows you to have more
orders that you can get out to vehicles. So it's an important technology. Like with
most technologies, though, it could be that technology that works or it could be
something that you learn from that technology that works. And so, there's a lot of --
again, a lot of diﬀerent ways we can solve what we're trying to do with online
grocery, and this is where we're headed right now.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Yeah. Another probably subconscious mannerism when one area you talk about a lot
is generating expense leverage in the stores. The chest comes out a little -- just a
little bit more when that conversation comes up. And it's interesting because the
perception might be, well, you rolled out automatic cleaners and automatic
unloaders that's driving it. It sounds like it's really not -- while those are helpful, it's
just running the stores smarter. Some of the indirect purchasing, those have been
the biggest drivers of this expense leverage. So A, is that right? B, where are there
opportunities to really continue to drive this home?

Page 11 of 18Michael Lasser
Brett Biggs
Michael LasserYeah, it's been a number of diﬀerent things. And any time you talk about Walmart,
the US business is a big piece of that. But international, Chris, our international CFO
is here, they've done a really nice job, particularly in the last year, of doing some
things on their own but also taking some of the learnings we've gotten in the US and
running those out into International. I think there's still room to go, particularly in
international. But it's been a lot of things. It's -- associates are more productive, and
they've become more productive because of some of the tools we've given them,
the technology we've given. It's easier to ﬁnd things in the back room. Things like
inventory being down signiﬁcantly versus ﬁve years ago just makes it easier to ﬁnd
things in the back room, so you just don't have to put the number of hours toward --
for doing that kind of activity.
We're more thoughtful about processes and are there ways to do things diﬀerently?
Are there ways to, in the home oﬃce, structure things diﬀerently where you had ﬁve
groups doing the same thing and we brought them together? Goods not for resale
would be one of those. We've talked about that we were -- I think the way I said it, we
were doing an okay job, but we had hundreds of people really in diﬀerent parts of
the organization that were doing a nice job in their own organization. But we weren't
pulling it together in a way that makes sense, and just pulling that together like, oh,
okay, and bringing in experts who've done this at other companies, just a diﬀerent
take on how we do that. And so, when I see us be able to do things like that, I know
there's more because I've been with the Company 20 years, and there's always
diﬀerent and better ways to do things, and we just always ﬁnd them. That's what
gives me conﬁdence to talk about our leverage.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Is it the right way to think about it that Walmart has now developed this competency
to operate a little bit more eﬃciently in whatever -- eﬃciently in...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think it comes to think through problems diﬀerently, thinking through problems
from a customer mindset, from a -- instead of, we want to get 20 basis points of
leverage this year, we need to cut X percent of this, it's, okay, we're going to get 20
basis points of leveraged sales, certainly, the best way to do that. But how do we do
things in a way that's sustainable. We've gone through periods of time in our history
where we would cut expenses but you just cut them and they come back because
you didn't change the nature of the work, you didn't change -- maybe you don't
need to do the work, period. And so, we're thinking about it in a much more
systemic way. And Doug is, I think, really challenging us in that way.

Speaking of challenges, dealing with challenges better than you have in the past
probably couldn't be more relevant than the current time, given all the uncertainty.
So can you give us a sense for how the coronavirus is impacting Walmart? You talked
a little bit about it a couple of weeks ago. We didn't -- it seemed like the ChinaFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-05

Brett Biggsbusiness was feeling some burden. There was a little bit of talk about supply chain
disruption. Where does this stand now?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. I think like a lot of other companies, we're just -- we're watching this really
closely. We're -- it wouldn't surprise you, the ﬁrst thing we're concerned about is
safety of associates and customers and making sure we're doing the right thing. In
China, our stores, for the most part, have stayed open, which -- the communities
there need that. But it's been challenging in China, and we talked about that a
couple of weeks ago. The US are starting to see more news, which I think everybody
anticipated, and we're just going to be really careful about it.
From a supply chain standpoint, we haven't seen major impacts. So not much
diﬀerent than I would have said a couple of weeks ago. I do think in ways, the work
that our merchants did around tariﬀs over the last 12 to 18 months helped us think
about some things diﬀerently that are probably paying oﬀ some now in how you
think about supply chain diﬀerently. It does feel like -- I'm reading the same things
you are, but it does feel like China is starting to kind of come back to work, which will
help from a factory standpoint. And we'll just have to keep monitoring it day-to-day,
week-to-week. We're seeing, as you would expect, stock-up with customers on
certain items, but not tremendous changes in customer behavior. Again, just week-
to-week, we'll have to see how it transforms, and we'll have to keep people safe and
continue to run the business eﬃciently as we can.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And isn't it fair to say that Walmart is in a better position today than it's ever been to
deal with an uncertainty like this? Its supply chain is much more agile. You have a
much more well-developed e-commerce business that can serve customers if there
are extended periods of hibernation. A, is that fair? And B, how much contingency
planning is being done to deal with the unknowns at this point?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, I think that's fair. Customer behavior can change in a period of time like this. I
think we saw that some in China as people bought more online and we were able to
satisfy some of that demand there. So having an e-commerce business, having
online grocery, able to serve customers in really diﬀerent ways, I think customers and
associates knowing that we're caring for their safety and then we're keeping that top
of mind is important from a trust standpoint with the Company. And as you would
expect, as a company, we're talking a lot about this and making sure that we're
doing the things that we should be doing. The ﬁnancial strength of the Company is
amazing. And the complexity that we deal with on a normal daily basis, given the size
and scale of our company, means that we have people that are really good at
challenges and how they work through problems, and I feel conﬁdent about what
we're able to do.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-05

And it does seem like there's more coordination and communication between the
diﬀerent parts of Walmart, between Sam's and the US business, between the
international and the domestic business than there ever has been before, which
those learnings can be really valuable in this time. Is that right?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, for certain. Judith McKenna, who runs our international business but also ran
operations in the US business, has a really good feel for how we do things. And she
and John Furner, obviously, talk a lot anyway but we'll be talking a lot. And
(inaudible) the team really likes each other. We get along well and coordinate well.
So all that matters, I think, in a time like this. But I have -- like I said, I feel -- I'm very
conﬁdent in our ability to handle whatever situation we end up having, handle it as
well as we can.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And speaking of Sam's, it's really become this incubation lab for a lot of innovation
that we're seeing come out of Walmart. Should we expect that to continue? And is
that how -- part of Sam's identity is right now? And then can you talk a little bit more
about Ask Sam, which was prominently featured a couple of weeks ago?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. A lot of people at Walmart spent time at Sam's. I spent three years at Sam's. It
was like some of the best parts of my career. And it is -- it's this really small $60
billion business that we have over there, but it does allow us to try diﬀerent things.
And we've had membership forever at Sam's, so we know what that looks like. And I
think it's always had a little bit of a technology bent. I think it sped up a bit under
John. And when you go over -- I was over there in their building a couple of weeks
ago, and they do view themselves now as kind of the tech incubator for Walmart,
which is kind of cool. And I have no doubt that Kath will continue that. I've known
Kath for several years and she likes to lean into things like that. And again, it's part of
their identity, and it's been great. We've learned a number of things.
The Ask Sam app is really interesting, and they were the ﬁrst ones to really lean into
Scan & Go and some other things like that. So when you look at Ask Sam, it's not just
about the app. It's voice, which is going to be really important over time. It already is
important to customers. And we're spending a lot of time and eﬀort on voice.
Jetblack was part of that, which we've now kind of merged into kind of the core
Walmart business. But that's an important part of what we want to do in the future,
and we get a great lab to test it in at Sam's.

Michael LasserAnd right now, Ask Sam is an employee-facing tool. It would only (multiple
speakers). Yeah. It will only be obvious that at some point, that customers could be
able to use it as well. Is that the right way to think about it?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I think when you look at things like merging the two apps, we're very focused on
our app. And we know, as you can make that app stickier with customers -- again, it's
one of these circular types of things. The more things you can put on the app, the
more sticky it becomes. The more sticky it becomes, the more you'll put eﬀort into
that app. And so you'll continue to see our app ramp up. But doing more things by
voice long term is a near certainty.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
I want to pivot to the International business in the few minutes that we have left.
Flipkart really attracted a lot of attention as part of the international dialogue. It's
probably, in some ways, performed well ahead of your expectations. And in other
ways, it's probably performed diﬀerent than your expectations. At what point -- at
some point, does it -- would it make sense for Flipkart to be a stand-alone business,
much like Walmex and much like some of these other businesses that you have?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, we've talked about longer term that IPO is a potential for that business. I can
tell you, it runs pretty independently right now, and that's -- when you buy a business
like that, that's what you want it to do. I was over there -- wow, it was only a few
weeks ago that I was over there, and I've been there several times, obviously, but
spent -- every time I go, I come back really energized. I came back into Doug's oﬃce,
I said, that is just -- it's a great business. They're smart. They're entrepreneurial. I
always feel fairly old when I go over there. Very young, but they're entrepreneurial,
but they're also really disciplined. When we have conversations, we talk about cash
ﬂow, we talk about returns, and I've tested whether they do that just for the CFO. But
actually, other people have talked about that as well. But they're a very disciplined
group.
If you think about the guidance we gave on Flipkart that losses will be pretty similar
to what we had last year, but we're still growing at a good rate. And so, that's really
discipline to be able to do that. I'm excited about it. PhonePe, I'm really excited
about and what that could do longer term. They're really changing how that
consumer interacts on ﬁnancial services. And I saw a presentation from them, and my
ﬁrst thought was, well, we need them focused on India, but there are just some cool
things that we could do in diﬀerent parts around the world. We'll get learnings from
that business, no doubt.

Brett Biggs{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
You know I'm not probably going to answer that question. I have thoughts. We have
1.3 billion Indian consumers. And so, if they just do things really well in India, it can
be a big business. And Flipkart can be a big business just in India. And when you
look at the transaction volumes and the number of visits, the monthly visits, 1 billion
monthly visits to Flipkart, the numbers -- even on Walmart's scale, the numbers are
pretty staggering in India.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Yeah. And as you think about the international portfolio, you've mentioned before
that you've made some changes. How aggressive do you need to be, from a
portfolio management perspective, from here? We read things in the news. Is it
you're happy with it, but if the right opportunity came up, then you would make
some change? Or maybe you want to push it a little further?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. You saw the actions we -- and the merger we contemplated last year with
Sainsbury in the UK that got blocked. Each market needs to stand on its own, serve a
purpose. And in a lot of cases, it's not just ﬁnancial, it's talent or it's process and
things that we learn from those markets. So it's not just -- it's not a black and white
type situation. But each one of -- each market needs to have a purpose inside the
Walmart portfolio, and that's kind of how we look at it. We're always looking at it.
There's initiatives in the US that we're always looking at and saying, do we keep
going? Do we not? So I don't -- the markets really -- that analysis isn't any diﬀerent
than we look at an initiative in the US.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Yeah. In the last few minutes we have, I want to talk about how Walmart's business
model is changing a little bit. One of the ways is there's a deeper push into health
care. Just as you get excited about some of the levers, it seems like Doug gets just as
excited about health care, like blood pressure cuﬀ movements or anything like that.
But maybe you could suggest it. Why is this the right opportunity?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Health care, I think, look around the world, is challenged. Deﬁnitely in the US, it's
challenge. It's too expensive. Even with all the money we're spending, when you
look at US health care versus other countries, we're not where we need to be from a
health care perspective. And there's very few companies of our scale -- very few have
our scale to be able to do something that can matter. And when we look at our
mission to save money, live better, health care ﬁts really, really well into that.
I was in our health care center in Dallas, Georgia just northwest of Atlanta a couple of
weeks ago. It's the ﬁrst time I've been in since they had opened it. It was amazing. IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-05

talked to the doctor that was on staﬀ that was working at the time. And there's
something there. And you can see -- you know when there's something there.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
The energy?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, there's something there in how the customer sees that. It's one of those things
where you got to get the business model right. You've got to make sure you've -- the
patients are getting what they need and all that. But we have that trust with the
customer. We have the ability to have that ﬁt in really well with what we do inside of a
supercenter from a service standpoint. The country needs it. We have the scale to be
able to impact something like that. So that's why it all makes sense.
If you go to the center in Dallas, we're not going to roll out like 3,000 of those
tomorrow, but we're learning from it. We have a second one open in Calhoun now,
the other side of Atlanta. We'll have more -- probably a few more that we'll roll out
this year. And we're going to learn from it. But it's one of those things that just -- we
can get the model right and we see the feedback we're getting from customers, it
just makes sense.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
One of the questions that do come -- does come up frequently with respect to this
topic is, what does Walmart bring to the table that should allow it to win in this area?
It seemed like one of the things you mentioned was scale. So is that right? Are there
others that make Walmart uniquely well positioned to win here?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think scale, the trust of the customer is really important. There's -- we know the
customers trust us in this area of the pharmacy business for a long, long time. They
trust us in this area. I saw it ﬁrsthand when I went into that clinic in Dallas that we can
generate the volume in those facilities. So you get trust right, you get scalability
right, you get the ﬁnancial resources to grow something like that, that's -- those are
three pretty meaningful things that not everyone has.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Yeah. There's a driving force out in retail. One of your big competitors who has got a
business model that is less about making money on transactions, it's more about
making money in selling computing power and advertising and air transportation
capacity. Does Walmart need to adjust its business model over time to evolve with
the changing landscape? And if so, is there just -- there's a good amount of runwayFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-05

Brett Biggsin the current business that there's time to be able to do that and develop diﬀerent
proﬁt pools?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, I think it is changing. We've talked -- you've heard us talk a lot over the last
couple of years about the ecosystem, and we have a pretty healthy ecosystem today.
We're growing things like ad revenue. We're growing our marketplace business,
both of which we think long-term will be a big part of our ecosystem. On things like
ad revenue, we want to make sure we're being balanced with what the customer
needs and make sure that when the customer comes to our website that they know
they can trust that whatever we're recommending is what's right for them and not
necessarily for who paid for the advertising. But there's a way to balance that, and
we feel good about our ability to drive the revenue but do what's right for the
customer and not make our website cluttered and some of the other things that I see
with competitors. Marketplace is going to be a big part of our business. If we're
sitting here three years from now, I think we're going to be talking about a much
bigger marketplace business than we have today. And that adds to assortment,
which adds to stickiness of the customers. It's very circular. There's a loop there and
a ﬂywheel there. So I'm excited about that as well.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
