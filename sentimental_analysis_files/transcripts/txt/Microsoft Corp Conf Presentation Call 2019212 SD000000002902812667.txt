All right. Yes, exactly, we're ready to go. Thank you, everybody, for -- thank you for
coming today. I really want to thank the Microsoft team for coming because for those
of you who may not be watching the weather in Seattle, they've gotten hit with a ton
of snow over the last week. And I know this was a herculean eﬀort to get here. So I
want to thank Julia White for coming. She's the Corporate Vice President of Azure
Marketing. She's been with us before. It's always a great session. We really
appreciate you taking the time to be here.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Absolutely, yes.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So I guess the thing we get asked a lot is just kind of, where are we in the transition?
If you go back a few years ago, ﬁve years ago, people would have thought by now,
100% of workloads -- well, everyone's always more optimistic -- would be in public
cloud. And depending on what stats you look at, we're far from that. But the market's
been growing very aggressively. How do you think about where we are in the
transition?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. There's a couple of diﬀerent angles -- the mic, yes, can you hear me? A couple
of diﬀerent angles on, I would say, we -- well, it is -- in general, the cloud adoption is
great. And it's deﬁnitely growing. And we're moving into even kind of late-stage
adopter. The percentage of the IP and the applications being built and migrated, go
into cloud is still pretty small. And we still have a lot more to go. So while most
companies today have some workloads that they're migrating to the cloud, they'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-12

Q - Heather Anne Bellinibuilding new in the cloud, it's still not the majority of what they're running. So -- but I
do think a couple of things have changed. We deﬁnitely have moved from seeing
kind of the mid-tier and early adopters moving into cloud and getting kind of the
ﬁrst workloads into the cloud into even the very late-stage adopters. So I think we
have -- from a kind of a cycle of a customer type, we've deﬁnitely pushed even
farther. And interestingly, in the past year, we've had some conversations, the very
really basic cloud conversations all over again because this next wave of adopters
have started to come in on that front.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right. So -- and when you think about workloads on Azure, what moved to there
ﬁrst? And I guess you have to think of it from -- by cohort, like you just mentioned,
right? So early adopters, what are they putting in Azure today that they weren't a few
years ago? And do you see the uptake of the technology -- kind of the migration
changing now that people have been able to learn from the cohorts before them?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. So they -- so there's the type of adopter.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
But then I see the -- for the overall TAM for Azure in the public cloud, right, it's 2
things. One is applications that exist today that can migrate to the cloud or net new
applications being built. So you can have migration or we have innovation, 2 basic
ways. And if you go back, the early, early cloud adopters was innovation, like net new
things, didn't have a lot. And actually some of the early Azure workloads that came --
a new mobile app, a new system being built. Then we moved to the wave of like,
"Actually, now I get it, the cloud. I'm really going to start migrating my existing set,
my mission-critical, my business area." And I'd say, if you went back three years, the
migration workloads looked like backup, disaster recovery, non-mission-critical line-
of-business systems. Now the migration pipe is as good as the innovation pipe. So
we've kind of normalized on that because you kind of have the types of tranches on
the workloads. Then within the migration, you're seeing things like SAP, huge
pipeline, like mission-critical systems running on Azure. Obviously, Microsoft's
running our own SAP system on Azure as a proof point. So we deﬁnitely moved out
of kind of lower-tier, Tier 2 type of workloads into migration into the Tier 1s. So I think
on both fronts, the balance between innovation kind of workloads and applications
and migration, that's normalized, which tells you things are kind of shaping to the
whole market. And then the level of sophistication of what's migrated has also
increased. But it's still early.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So how do you -- I mean, I don't know to the extent you guys kind of talk about this.
But if you can give us a way to think about, you were just kind of going down this
path, like IaaS versus PaaS penetration in Azure. So meaning, of Azure workloads,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 16A - Julia White
Q - Heather Anne Bellini
A - Julia Whiteright, what percentage of them would be -- or revenue, how much would be PaaS
versus IaaS? Like how do you think about that like moving higher up?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
The way I think about it is more what -- and I would encourage others to think about
it is think about it by the workload, the applications customers are using, right? And
if it's just a straight migration, you're going to use core infrastructure, right? Then
even like a couple of years ago, people would just say, "I'm just going to migrate and
then leave it alone." I don't actually meet a customer who talks like that anymore.
Walmart is a great example. They started just migrating. And then they're like, "We
don't do that anymore. We modernize everything that we're bringing over because
we see the eﬃciencies we get." And when you say modernization, what does that
mean? It means I'm using more than just core infrastructure. I'm using things like
your developer services, your data services, managed services to get the greater
eﬃciencies of the cloud as well as you're now taking advantage of what we talk
about, cloud-native services that were built from the beginning to have this
incredible scale, supereﬃcient, great user experiences. So I'd say most -- so from the
overall pipeline, we still have a lot of people just migrating infrastructure. But then
almost immediately after that, the modernization work happens. And that's when
these platform services and data services start getting consumed.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So I mean, you've been involved in this business for quite some time. If you take a
look at kind of the marketing message that you would help the team create from
when you're looking at your competitors and kind of going through the pros and
cons or the competitive diﬀerentiation, what does it look like today? How do you feel
you're competing? And what are the strengths and weaknesses that you talk about?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. The things that we both talk about. But also we hear back from customers
because it'd just be us talking about it. First, I think hybrid has been, for a long time,
a huge diﬀerentiator and our belief that compute will be distributed, not just all in
public cloud but distributed on-premises as well. And that's true in what we talk
about as hybrid with data center and cloud but even as we move into more of the
intelligent edge and more distributed compute. And so building consistency around
that area. So we can certainly talk more about that. Then the next one would be
overall just talk about productivity. And this is again a point of view that we came --
we, because of our heritage, know that customers have a varied range of technology
skill sets and technology teams. And so we built in the management tools, built in
the developer tools, built in policies such that as people were moving to the cloud,
they didn't have to learn all this tooling again. We just built-in. So all the systems are
there. So the productivity message certainly resonates. And the last one is actually --
really increasing is around trust. And that's trust of our security, our compliance, our
privacy. We have more accreditations and attestations. I mean, in the public cloud,
certainly important. But it's pivoted even farther now to a trusted vendor in that we
are very transparent about what our core competencies are, what businesses we're
in, we're not going to turn around and compete with our customers. And that'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-12

Q - Heather Anne Belliniobviously a big theme that we hear about from the market as well in terms of overall
trusting Microsoft as a partner.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right. And Amy has talked a lot on the earnings calls about Enterprise Mobility being
included obviously in the Azure line and just the strength of that business. And we
kind of think of that as maybe more of a SaaS application that's running on top of
that. How do you think about the other types of SaaS applications? And the reason
why we care about it is, typically those have higher gross margins, right? So how do
we think about kind of the -- how you can expand those other touch points within
Azure -- SaaS touch points within Azure?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. So our -- so Enterprise Mobility or EMS is a set of Azure services that we then sell
sapplications, right. But to protect the user on their device from their apps. And so
kind of that package, that is really -- actually goes to the market with our Microsoft
365. So a great opportunity there. But other areas, I mean, honestly, all of our data
services, really, I think, follow in that class of kind of higher-level services. And that
part of the Azure business is incredibly healthy. And so we see a ton of opportunity
in that class of services. And again, it's about customers moving into the cloud. And
one of the biggest problems we're trying to solve is around their data estate with
operational data but also analytical data. Particularly, everyone has an AI strategy,
everybody. And what they do, they're like, "I got to use AI, I got to create AI in all my
applications, my systems." Then, "I get always, like, dreams about AI." Then they go,
"Look, I have no data, my analytics systems are old and rigid and...
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
How do you AI without the data?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Right. And so quickly they pivot to, like, "Oh, gosh, we got to work on our analytics,
our data warehousing, our data lake." And so that part of our cloud growth is
phenomenal because if you're going to go do -- if you're going to build AI, you're
not going to build a data estate and analytics systems on-premises. It just doesn't
make sense. So that part is, I think, from the more higher level services.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right. So we probably don't hear as much about that one on the earnings calls. But it
would seem like that would be one that's on the come then in terms of what we
should be.
(technical diﬃculty)
a little less EMS maybe just given how well you guys have done there and a bit more
in this area.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-12

Yes. I mean, if you think about from the overall growth, EMS with, what, 94 million
paid users, it's like huge business. Phenomenal, we love it. But it does at some point
slow at that scale where the data services and other areas of Azure just -- we're still
putting up triple-digit numbers on really big businesses.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right. And that's the other question that comes up a lot. I'm interested, from your
perspective. So the investors, the consternation every quarter about whether Azure
growth is -- whether it's 74% or 76%, like a lot of market cap trades on very small
diﬀerence in percentages.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
I know. Amy reminds me about that all the time.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
I'm sure she does. What do you say to people who ﬁxate on that speciﬁc number?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Well it is an important number. So not a bad one to pay attention to -- if you're going
to pay attention to it. But you have to keep it in perspective, right? I mean, Azure is a
massive business. And the way we report it is also inclusive of the EMS part of the
business as well. So in the per user, that will have a graduating growth aspect to it as
well. Then -- but if you unpack behind that number, there is incredible growth within
it. We've seen about the data services like a triple-digit growth. And those are huge -
- huge new industries that we're going into. So yes, a business of our size, you're
going to see growth moderate. And I always feel bad -- internal reviews. We have
very high expectations. Amy has very high expectations on us. And I say, beatings for
these businesses that are multimillion-dollar businesses. And they're only growing at
100%. And I'm like, "God, where does this happen?"
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So try and keep it a high-class problem.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
It is, it is. Yes, I'm like, when I went to business school, no one taught me how to grow
a multibillion-dollar business at 100%, yet here we are. So -- but so within the
dynamics of it. So feel good about a couple of things. One, the new businesses
we're entering into, whether it be analytics, you're going to see over the next quarter
additional places we're investing, new businesses we're crashing into. I mean, we've
eﬀectively got an unlimited TAM that we're playing with for the majority of Azure, all
right? EMS has a per-user cap to it. But from an IaaS and PaaS perspective...

A - Julia WhiteVery unlimited.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
It's more about operationalizing it well, capitalizing on it well. So yes, you'll see the
growth continue to stabilize but in really high numbers though.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
How do you internal benchmarking on your Azure performance? Like how do you --
what do you -- how do you know -- like how do you determine, okay -- how do you
make Amy happy? Is there a certain benchmark she looks at? Is it AWS' growth rate?
Is it -- how do you -- how are you kind of grading yourself on that segment?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. Obviously, it's a triangulation of a few diﬀerent areas. Certainly, looking at what
other vendors have been growing and where rates have been at the same in time in
their life cycle is certainly one way to look at it. Looking at what the size and shape of
the existing on-premises equivalency would be and then how fast is that moving.
Then we see just early signals in terms of if AI is going to be true, then this type of
data adoption needs to be happening. And so working back from what we see from
a market signal perspective. So it's looking at those 3. It's a little bit of an arc
obviously when you're in kind of an unlimited TAM type of business. But we do --
and every time we think we put up aggressive numbers, Amy kind of pushes us a
little harder, which is her job. And we keep trying to do it.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So one question that started to come up over the last few months was there was this,
I guess, idea that salespeople were getting paid to presell capacity. So getting paid
quota to presell capacity. How -- and this might not be kind of your area of expertise.
But just kind of how do you think about how the go-to-market has changed? And we
were always told that the process of getting paid pre-usage, right, changed a few
years ago and now with more like the salespeople are focused on consumption.
How do we -- what can you share with us about kind of how the go-to-market has
changed and potentially the -- how compensation strategies have changed?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. It was a 3-year journey where we took our sales force from being paid on billed
revenues. So it's selling Microsoft expired licenses or Azure commits to being purely
paid on consumption. So we kind of graduated each of three years, we were 100%
based on consumption now for -- so any Microsoft salesperson who is paid on Azure,
it's about consumed revenue. So if they -- if a customer chooses to say, "Hi. I want to
give you $1 million upfront. And I'll use it over the next year," that salesperson
doesn't see $1 million in their quota. They see it as it gets consumed through the
year. So 100% true on that. The company will still obviously ﬁnancially recognize if a
customer chooses to bill upfront. And we had -- it's interesting, we had pulled and
done so much ﬁeld retrainings, they go out of this build motion, get rid of that
muscle memory and go to consumption. Then we actually found customers are like,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 16Q - Heather Anne Bellini
A - Julia White
Q - Heather Anne Bellini
A - Julia White"No, no, I actually kind of like to buy and lock up my dollars." Yes. So there's actually
a customer
(technical diﬃculty)
(and feeling) that. So of course, we'll take the money that way. But that's not -- so we
don't -- but that's not how the salespeople on the front lines are actually being
recognized. And that's not how we also incentivize or compensate our partner
channel either. That's also on consumed revenue.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right, okay. And I wanted to spend a little bit of time on Azure Hybrid Beneﬁt, which
seems like, I mean, you guys are uniquely positioned to oﬀer this Bring-Your-Own-
License movement. Can you talk to us about when this really started to make its way
into the market and what the feedback has been? When did you start to see
customers have that moment where they said, "Okay, this is great"?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. So this is the context. So we have Azure Hybrid Beneﬁt. So if you're a Windows
Server or a SQL Server customer, you can, with your Hybrid Beneﬁt -- with Microsoft
Azure, Hybrid Beneﬁts allows you to basically run your Windows, SQL -- Windows
Server, SQL Server in Azure. And you don't have to repurchase the IP when you do
that. So it's a fantastic advantage for -- kind of gives on-premises customers and the
buyers of Windows and SQL kind of insurance plans because most people know
they want to go to the cloud in the next generation. And then obviously, it gives
Azure a wonderful price advantage in terms of being able to run it with the same IP
that you've already bought. So -- and so like...
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And when did that go into eﬀect?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
I was going to say I think we're now in our second year oﬃcially when that program
landed. But the -- it took oﬀ in a couple of -- mostly about 18, 12 months ago where
we really saw adoption (craze). There's just awareness, we have to get out. And
people buy. Then also, we just -- we operationalized it in the product itself. So when
you're in Azure, when you go to deploy a virtual machine, it says, "Hi. do you have
Azure Hybrid Beneﬁt?" So it also just made it really frictionless for a customer to take
advantage of that. But we're seeing a huge beneﬁt in both our on-premises licensing
because of the beneﬁt it adds to those customers. But also, our pipeline of Windows
and SQL applications migrating to Azure is fantastic. And I mean, on -- the other
aspect of this, too, we have the Azure Hybrid Beneﬁts. But we also have our Windows
and SQL Server 2008 product that's going into extended support. That's 10 years
old. That means it's going out of mainstream support. So customers are faced with 2
options. One, they can buy extended security updates for about 75% of the cost of
license or they can move and run it on Azure and get that for free. So it's a secondaryFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-12

that space).
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right, right. And is that -- do they have to pay that per year if they stay -- if they stay
just saying they want to do it on-premise and paying the updates?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
It's 75% (inaudible) for three years.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
For three years. And after that, you have to do something?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Then you get customer agreements after that, yes.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Okay, okay.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
So yes, it's not a pretty road. And in general, like that's -- it's a good -- it's just a good
catalyst anytime -- it's not actually that diﬀerent than what's happening on SAP, right,
where everyone on SAP has to move to HANA by 2025. That is a huge catalyst of
people saying, "Okay, I got to (touch) my SAP system. Am I going to move to HANA?
Or am I going to move to the cloud?" Again, that's -- we see a phenomenal pipeline
around SAP systems moving to Azure and I think with that catalyst. And the 2008
extended support and the support into security updates is another one of those. So
2 big, big growth opportunities for the business.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And how do you feel -- like we didn't talk speciﬁcally about AWS before. But how do
you feel you've closed the functionality gap relative to them over the years? Or do
you not think about it that way?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
No. I mean, customer -- it's -- I'd say what's reﬂected in customer and partner
conversations are, it's -- for the most part now I think people say we're equal, right, if
it's analysts, if it's customers. And the interesting thing is most customers I go to, like,
"Oh, you're missing this feature. But I know you're going to have it soon enough."
And -- or, "AWS is missing that feature. But they'll probably get it, too." So it's pretty
normalized from a pure technology perspective. There's places that are materially
diﬀerent that come up. Hybrid, that category of things, we have a bunch of stuﬀ they
can't touch. So a few aspects like that. But other than that, it's pretty normalized from
that perspective. Then it's more into -- AWS, obviously, they were out ﬁrst, they're theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-12

A - Julia Whiteleader. They get the beneﬁt of that doubt. When I was leading the Oﬃce 365
business, I had that luxury. So I know what it's like, where we have to hunt a little
harder on the Azure side. But I see the trust factor comes up a lot. And I think that it's
one of those intangibles. But if your partner -- the partner meetings I had this
morning were like, "Hi. I used to work with AWS. But now I don't. I worry they're
competing with me." That's just a very...
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
That comes up a lot.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
This is a very real concern, right? And I think I'm proud of the work we've done to be
very transparent about our plans, our core competency, what we're doing, what
we're not doing, such that we know what it's -- we've had 40 years of having to build
trust. I know what that looks like.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So there used to be a good bit of Windows revenue run -- or Windows workloads
running on AWS. Should that -- like what happens to those going forward? I mean,
that was before maybe you became as strong as you guys are. Do you -- what's the
trend in Windows workloads running on AWS? And do you ﬁnd -- is there a way for
you to kind of shift those workloads back to Azure?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
I'd say -- I don't have their numbers obviously. But I can see mine. And the pipeline...
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
But they must send you a check, right?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Well yes, we -- there are certain boundaries we have to...
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Yes, yes, okay. Amy knows this.
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
But we -- I would say that I would be shocked if their pipeline of Windows SQL is
better than ours. Despite them being bigger obviously, I think we have phenomenal
growth there. And we have these very, very diﬀerentiated opportunities on that front.
When -- taking applications oﬀ of a cloud to another one, honestly, is a place where
we could spend a lot of time. And our competitive nature would want us to. But I'm
like, the white space and the TAM of this business is so big, I don't actually
encourage our salespeople to focus a lot of energy on that. If a customer's like, "Hi. I
can't trust AWS," or "I can ﬁnd better (business) with you," we'll say switch. But it'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-12

A - Julia Whitenot necessarily the place I'm actively hunting down and trying to go pull oﬀ of it. And
I mean, the other aspect, too, which is up in AWS is it's a multi-cloud world. And I
think we've expected that. If you look at on-premises today, it's very heterogeneous.
And I don't think the cloud will be any diﬀerent. And I see people making diﬀerent
decisions or are, "Hi. I'm going to do new innovation on this type cloud. And I'm
going to do migration on this cloud." Or -- it's really -- the customer's mindset for the
most part is departments or application by application. And so they can do best of
breed, they can want to have -- kind of spread their estate across diﬀerent vendors
for vendor control, vendor lock-in concerns, a lot of diﬀerent things. So even though
there's -- a customer might have a Windows SQL application on AWS doesn't mean
they're not going to put their next one on Azure. And it'll be blended. I expect that to
continue to be true.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
What is your take on AWS Outposts?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. I -- it's come a little -- (it's heartening). It was funny to watch. They wouldn't even
say the word hybrid or if they're -- like they would literally not say the word. And
you'd be like, "That's so weird." But I guess if you only have a cloud, you have a
hammer that hits the nail. And we wouldn't talk about hybrid for ﬁve years. We've
had Azure Stack in market for over two years, right. And they ﬁnally utter the word
hybrid and then -- and now it's Outposts. And I even laugh a little bit, the name, like,
Outposts. Like you're not serious about it. It sounds like something you have to do,
the way they named it even, tells you how they really feel about it. But I think it's
interesting, it's not Azure Stack, people are now doing -- trying to compare. First of
all, it's not in market. I think it's a year out. It's deﬁnitely diﬀerent than what Azure
Stack is, which is a full kind of integrated cloud system that you can run locally. This,
from what I can see, looks like their kind of platform layer services being able to run
on existing infrastructure in kind of a managed way. But we'll see how that turns out.
I think it's a kind of like welcome to the -- welcome to reality. Customers are hybrid,
don't need hybrid. Interesting to see how they play on that. And again, it's diﬀerent
to try and do it after the fact and have a hybrid oﬀering versus build from the
beginning. We have identity, we have data, we have management, all hybrid. So...
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
I want to see if there's any questions in the audience as we're -- oh, there's one. I
think there's a mic runner. Hold on, he'll be right there.
I think there's a perception that you guys are very strong in large-scale enterprises
for many of the things you've talked about: hybrid, your reliability, your long-scale
trust. How are you positioning yourself with younger companies, with start-ups. So
that you're relevant for that next generation of companies?

A - Julia WhiteYes. If you looked at -- so starting from, let's say, a segmentation perspective, if you
look at the Azure business, we're actually very equally distributed across small
business, kind of midsize enterprise and large enterprise from a consumed revenue
perspective. So it's maybe more balanced than people might think. We obviously are
very strong in enterprise. But overall, very, very healthy in small business as well. So
feel great about that, feel great about execution and the growth rate. And I actually
think really strong in our SMB kind of our web direct business, superstrong. So -- but
speciﬁc to your question on start-ups, we have a couple of diﬀerent initiatives, very
targeted at start-ups. And there, we have Reactors and kind of co-innovation centers
around the world. We also have investment programs where we provide start-ups
not just money. But resources. Then actually the thing that most start-ups (that reach)
and work with us on is that we do go to market with them. So if you come and you
work with us and you -- do your technology running on Azure, then you earn your
right to be able to be co-sold by our sales force, which is a huge lever for start-ups.
And so that's -- you obviously earn your way to that level. But the idea that you could
be suddenly sold by 50,000 Microsoft salespeople across the globe, it's pretty
impressive. So we're seeing a lot of strong demand from that speciﬁcally. And if you
go back a couple of years ago, us, AWS, GCP, were all throwing out a bunch of
credits for start-ups. And I think they're mostly burning money because they would
just move from one program to the next program and use credits and then leave.
Where now, we have a much more focused value-add -- 2-way value-add programs
with start-ups speciﬁcally. So feel good about our pipeline there. And obviously, if
they're a B2B start-up, they love us. If you're B2C, you don't have quite as much, just
because our global sales force isn't necessarily focused on that. But it's okay.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Any other questions? There's one back there.
I just sort of detected a bit of a pickup from management whenever they would talk
about the fact that Microsoft oﬀers solutions where -- and you don't compete with
customers. And when Heather asked that, you essentially said you don't go -- your
salespeople don't go chase these kind of customers. Am I missing something here?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
I didn't hear that very well. So one more time.
I guess what I'm trying to ask is, I detected a pickup in the tone from management
recently about Microsoft not competing with their customers. Just I can (see that
throughout) Amazon competing with customers, whereas you said that you don't
really chase customers per se, which Amazon may be competing with. There's a bit
of mismatch between this. I'm just wondering where and what am I missing?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
I'll tell you what I'm seeing and see if that answers your question perhaps, is I would
say things like retailers and ﬁnancial services companies now and now into healthFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-12

A - Julia Whitecare, seeing Amazon go into those businesses and saying, "Gosh, am I going to give
money to people who are now competing with me?" And more than money actually,
the deeper issue is data, right? If you're running your systems on a cloud, they have
a sense of the data, where information is coming from. And just it's information you
probably don't want to share with someone who's competing in your same space.
So there -- I think that's the thing that I see come up most often and why you're
seeing like Kroger and Walgreens, Boots and Gap and lots of companies now
moving actively to Azure to distance themselves from basically feeding the
competition. So maybe that -- I don't know if that answers your question. But...
You mentioned some of the diﬃculties of converting an AI strategy into reality. And
I'm wondering, are you seeing that in any of your -- this takeup of some of your AI
compute oﬀerings, that actually everyone wanted to say that they were going to use
all of this and, actually, the reality isn't quite as strong as you thought?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. They -- I mean, I think we're -- as in lots of other technologies are about a
(height) cycles, right? And so everyone got very excited about AI. And they're still
excited. If I look at our Executive Brieﬁng Center, AI is the #1 conversation customers
want to come have with us. So this tells you the index on that. And if people said,
"Great, I want to do AI," they're like, "Okay, well, that -- there's 2 things in AI." There's
models, AI models that have been prebuilt, like we prebuild them with all the data
and resources we have. So like a computer vision, we can detect that this is a shoe
versus a water bottle. And you can just use that AI model in your application and not
to have to do a lot. We've seen a lot of adoption of those prebuilt models because if
I'm building an application, I can just take advantage of that AI model. Then there's
the more sophisticated, which is, "I'm going to build my own AI models to power my
supply chain or to predict customer behavior." And that's where you need to get into
data sciences, where you're going to be using very specialized compute to be able
to process and run those kind of algorithms in high ﬁdelity. And that's a much more
complicated conversation. And it tends to start with they dream of doing it. But they
don't have the data scientist, they don't quite know what they want to do yet. So that
tends to be much more about analytics, getting into data science basics and then
taking advantage of the compute that we have available for it. So there's kind of 2
classes of prebuilt AI models they can use and then building their own and the
capability around that.
And how do you plan your end capacity for that? And a wider question, how do you
plan capacity for, yes, you say you're seeing such strong growth?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. There's a lot of science in that. So it's a combination of, ﬁrst of all, where globally
we see the demand signal. We obviously have lots and lots of models around how to
predict demand and where it's going to be coming from. But then we also do -- we
have very good visibility into our sales pipeline, both from our direct ﬁeld but alsoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-12

A - Julia Whitefrom our partners, of the type of applications and the type of workloads people are
coming on. Like SAP is a certain type of compute that we know we need and we can
have a -- we have a pretty good sense of where it needs to be distributed. AI was
one that's, because it's still early, it's a little harder to predict. So that one, we have
probably not perfect capacity utilization on that one just because it's so early. It's not
a big part of our ﬂeet either. That's kind of specialized compute. So it's not like being
wildly oﬀ makes a lot of diﬀerence in the margins. But that's the one that's a little bit
harder.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
I wanted to ask about container adoption and interest in serverless. What are
customers saying to you about both of those?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. So in the kind of higher-level services, I -- basically, my simple way is there's 2
classes. There's data services. And then there's the kind of developer platform
services. So containers and serverless, as we talk about, is on more the developer
system. Back to the applications that are on-premises, they migrate. Then once they
migrate, the very ﬁrst thing you do to modernize is move to containers. And like the
world has chosen Kubernetes and containerization and then -- and using this
technology called Kubernetes to do it. If you go to a Kubernetes conference, they're
selling out. It is mainstream average companies, like it's gone from being elite tech
to being everybody's choice. So that is absolutely the next wave, it is core to every
modernization project I've seen. I expect it to continue to be because we're doing it
internally. So I think that is a very real trend. And on serverless, there's a lot of
confusion around what does serverless really mean. And people started talking
about it as event-driven. It's kind of, this thing is like, hey, if an action happens, an
outcome, you make another action. And (inaudible) serverless is basically how PaaS
works, right? So we talk about serverless, we don't really say PaaS anymore. It's like
anything that doesn't require you to manage the compute and now working in
storage underneath. And that all comes into play when you're doing modernization
or net new innovation applications. And I think that's a strong trend on that side of
things.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So does that become deﬂationary to an extent? Because you went to cloud 4 or ﬁve
years ago, you were deploying PaaS and buying Reserved Instances, for example, for
periods that you might not be using it for. But you wanted to make sure it was always
available. And as you move to serverless, you only have to use it when you need it,
right? And how do you think about the deﬂationary aspects that it could cause on
someone's IaaS and PaaS infrastructure, right, versus kind of how much it could
ignite even more spending, right, be additive and then create new use cases and
new applications?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. I think you would theoretically say, "Gosh, it's going to be deﬂationary because
everything's going to shift over there. And then we're going to get supereﬃcient inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-12

A - Julia Whitehow we use it." I don't see the reality moving quite like that. And if you look at --
again, if you classify both data and developer services in that, the data services are
growing incredibly hot. And so any shift from the core infrastructure where they're
running it -- it's going to make it up in data even if it's kind of more deﬂationary on
the developer high level.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right. So on a collective basis, it's net increase in spending. It just depends on how
you're allocating it. Is that the right way?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. And I do think there was -- as we've gotten more sophisticated in what
serverless means and the technology, there's diﬀerent types of it, right? And things
like our event-driven is supereﬃcient from a customer perspective, very low cost,
awesome. Hard to run systems on event-driven technology, really hard, like if you
really know what you're doing when you build a brand-new app, you can totally
make it work with event-driven only. But there's not many people on the planet that
can do that or really want to. So the theoretically possible versus what I think is
actually going to happen looks a little diﬀerently. And there'll be much more of a
balanced approach in people -- how people use the technology.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Was there a question -- I saw him standing there. Was there a question here? No,
okay. I saw the mic runner. So sorry. The -- we had Thomas Kurian who is now CEO of
Google Cloud here earlier this morning. I was wondering what -- when you're doing
a competitive analysis or when you're hearing feedback from customers, how does
GCP ﬁt into the equation?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. More of like outside in what I see. I say almost every conversation customer
partner is AWS, Azure. That's -- I expect that in every meeting and every discussion.
The -- I see GCP occasionally. And they mostly show up -- like I was in France, the
conversation there, they tend to come in -- and again, I'm just reﬂecting. But I think
about anything else...
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Yes. Not Microsoft views, what customers are telling you?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. What I see, this reality is they come in with -- they could -- in a diﬀerent way,
maybe to the CMO from AdWords or G Suite and then kind of buy the GCP usage
from that. And so it's more of kind of a roundabout way to get into those accounts
and more by the business. And I think if you're early in trying to get enterprise wins,
you're going to go by the business. So that's more of what I see come in. And it's not
frequent, to be honest. It's geographies, I see a few places.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-12

Okay. Last question I had was about GitHub and the role that you see GitHub playing
and expanding your developer audience. How do you think about GitHub and how
it ﬁts in?
{BIO 20496259 <GO>}
Yes. And that's more at a Microsoft level, right, in terms of being an incredible
developer resource, tens of millions of developers and hundred million repositories
and a wonderful open-source ecosystem. And so in terms of Microsoft and
developer relevancy, it's a wonderful asset. It'll continue to be run independently,
like you've seen us do with LinkedIn or Minecraft. And so have very independent
capabilities in decision-making and autonomy, which is really important. And we
deeply understand and value that. And yet we also see opportunities to help
customers. So as an example, we put an oﬀer together that allows our enterprise
customers to buy GitHub Enterprise on Microsoft licensing. And we didn't -- there's
not a big promotion. We just kind of put it out there. And we just see an incredible
adoption of it, like customers are begging because they're -- GitHub's enterprise
oﬀering wasn't really done in an enterprise way, the way Microsoft was, right. And so
customers were hungry for that. And so when we just did a pretty simple thing for
them, it got easier, like, "Great, now I can do all this as one thing." So where we see
great customer beneﬁt and have natural aﬃnity, a wonderful opportunity together,
we're not good to be heavy-handed or (jamming) hazard on them or anything of that
nature.
