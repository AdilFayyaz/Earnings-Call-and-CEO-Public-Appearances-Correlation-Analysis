Why don't we go ahead and get started? I'd like to welcome everyone to this
morning session. It's my distinct pleasure to welcome to the stage the management
team of NVIDIA Corporation. To my left is Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and
CFO, also in attendance in the audience Simona Jankowski, who runs Investor
Relations for NVIDIA.
Our format is fairly straightforward. We're going to have a 30-minute ﬁreside chat in
this room. If you have any questions, there are mics that are being sort of walked
around, there's one stationary over there. Please raise your hand and we'll try to get
you there. But I'll start things out.
First Colette, I really appreciate you. It's great to have people live after a year hiatus
and I really appreciate you guys participating this year. So thank you. The ﬁrst
question I tend to ask is really a setting the stage question. I think since the last time
you were at on stage here, the stock is up sixfold. I think your stock is up 150% this
year. Help us remind or at least remind people in the audience, what's the vision, the
mission statement that Jensen and you have for the company. And speciﬁcally, what
are you doing to try to fulﬁll kind of that vision, especially around that your recent
acquisitions like Mellanox and the proposed acquisition of Arm.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Great question to start oﬀ with and thank you again for breaking the ice and
holding the very ﬁrst in-person investor conference, we're glad to be here. Our
vision of NVIDIA may not have really changed over a long period of time. We set out
with the journey of helping in accelerated computing. The very ﬁrst app that we
found that could use accelerated computing was gaming, and it's still in our heart
and soul as a company as we continue to improve that.
But what we did ﬁnd was other great use cases and platforms for accelerated
computing. One of the great outcomes of accelerated computing has been AI andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30

A - Colette M. Kressbuilding that. We look forward and think of us as a full stack data center computing
company. When we mean a full stack, that means we start layer by layer. First layer
that we think about is those chips, those systems and build up to the second layer,
which would be our platform layer that is focused on the engines that are important
to so much of that acceleration. Everything from RTX to AI to simulation, many other
types of engines are very important to us. And then, lastly, on our top part of the
stack is software.
We will enable software frameworks towards applications for diﬀerent industries and
that's how we've designed this full stack. So Mellanox has been added to that
because we really think about the overall data center computing world as looking at
the full data center end-to-end, every step along the way of data and networking is
part of that. They've been a great addition to us and we'll continue to build upon
that strategy for future growth as well.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
(Question And Answer)
A lot of company speciﬁc questions, but I'd like to start oﬀ with kind of more of a
bigger picture question about the state of the industry today because clearly we're
in one of the worst supply shortages for semiconductors that the industry has ever
seen. If I look at kind of what you guys have done over the last couple of quarters,
your purchase obligations were up 45% sequentially last quarter after being up 40%
sequentially the quarter before, after being up 35% sequentially the quarter before.
How tight is the current environment? And when do you expect sort of supply to
actually start to accelerate so that you can actually meet all the unfulﬁlled demand
out there that you see
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Our largest issue that we deal with is demand is greater than supply, demand is
greater than supply. We've been working all through the last 18 months focusing on
supply, but really understanding that the world has changed in terms of how they
need to think about procuring supply. It ranges from everything starting with wafers,
to substrates, to components, to contract manufacturers. We talk about the
distribution of the logistics, all companies really have to think through that. It's also
taking the full ecosystem. You have to think about your supply ahead of your
products, it is also thinking about the supply of the systems that you may enable
downstream. And that's when we started focusing full and our ecosystem of doing
that.
We have also therefore started to procure longer term. Most of our discussions with
our suppliers has been what do we see going forward, how can we help them and
enable them to build the capacity that they will need to support the system going
forward. Helping them with that and working on long-term procurement you will see
now in our purchase commitments, you will see that in our inventory. How long will itFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30

Q - John Pitzertake until this bounces out? It's diﬃcult to say. We feel very good about, of course,
our guidance that we have provided, we feel good about the beginning of next year
and what we've computed, but when we think about the second half of next year, I
think, we'll be in a great position given so much of the work that we've already done
on long-term procurement.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
You and I talked about this on the call back after a recent quarter and in an
environment where supply is this tight, you just kind of take seasonality and throw it
out the window. Is growth over the next couple quarters really a function of how
much supply you can get? Question number one. And the second question around
that is, given the concern in gaming around crypto and you guys have done a much
better job with CMP to try to ring-fence that potential risk, but it's kind of silly when
you think about how lean channel inventory is today in gaming to think that crypto is
this big overhang that could potentially come and be a problem anytime soon?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So ﬁrst when you think about seasonality, we get asked quite often in terms of
our quarter-to-quarter seasonality. It's a common question, but you are correct, with
the supply constraints we are really operating on what demand levels do we need to
ﬁll, how do we think about the supply behind that. So yes, seasonality has not
restored itself, and it's not very clear in terms of when it will restore itself in the
supply constraint world.
Secondly, when we think about our gaming business, one that has probably been
the most impacted from that lack of seasonality, we are still in a case where demand
strongly exceeds the supply and our channel inventories are at very low level. We
work each day trying to improve that situation, but there's a lot of diﬀerent reasons
that are causing that. One, RTX is just a phenomenal new capability for gaming. It is
really transform how game makers are making their games, how creatives are
working every single day. So not only are we exceeding the overall gaming market
as a whole, we are continuing to expand new use cases beyond just a gamer, the
creatives, the broadcasters.
Additionally, you've seen the large rise of notebooks. Notebook gaming, high-end
notebooks that are still thin and light that you can do your best gaming. You can take
your gaming everywhere has been a great growth driver for us as well. Finding and
making sure that supply as well all the way through the OEMs is an important part of
our work today.
And then, lastly, there probably is still some cryptocurrency in the -- in our numbers,
very diﬃcult for anybody to quantify because we just can't see that piece of it. But
with the lean channel inventory and our steps that we have done to create other
avenues for the crypto money, we believe we're in a really good position for it to
continue to grow.

Page 4 of 12A - Colette M. KressAnd then Colette, probably the number one question I get about NVIDIA, especially
as and I don't want to jinx things. You're knocking on the door of a trillion dollar
valuation, which is just astounding. Is what really is the TAM opportunity here? And
you I've had many discussions about this and I think the latest -- and it's really a data
center question I think more than a gaming question. I think the latest numbers you
guys gave out at the last Analyst Day was a $100 billion TAM. And I look at that
number and I think, okay, you guys are trying to balance something that's big with
something that's credible. Not that there is you know a lot of bottoms up work that
goes into that, but we all struggle in this room trying to ﬁgure out what that TAM is.
We tried to look at attach rates of GPUs to server shipments. But if you look at
fundamentally what NVIDIA is doing is you're fundamentally lowering the cost of
analytics and typically when you look at technology, when, one half of the ecosystem
ﬁgures out ways to do things cheaper. The other half of that ecosystem comes up
with brand new use cases that always grow the market to be signiﬁcantly larger.
You're also augmenting what you're doing in silicon, as you mentioned earlier in
your prepared -- in your opening remarks that you're augmenting your silicon with
software stacks. So how do we think about the TAM opportunity you have inside of
data center over time?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. Really good to break down why the success has been there, why the TAMs are
so large. One, we created a capability with acceleration to streamline the entire path
in terms of how you process data. And if we think back to the piles and piles of data
that was out there, that was just not analyzed, not able to get to. And when you think
about a world of prior to the end of Moore's Law, there was never going to be an
opportunity to get that done. So that huge transformation and aha that came forth
with a new platform approach really expanded out the TAM.
It's not the easiest to look at a attach rate to a server because we're not each server
because we're going to change the overall conﬁguration within a data center
regarding the number of GPUs versus the number of servers in a whole. So it's not
exactly the best way to look at it. But what we did was we analyzed each of the
industries, how much they spend, procure on their data centers and getting an
understanding of how quickly they would move to this accelerated world. They all
will, our dream, our thoughts, our vision is that they will all move to acceleration.
How fast? That depends. Then comes in our software approach. Our software
approach is to really help enterprises make that move. Enterprises need the help in
stitching it together that system, software, that overall application framework to their
applications to move to an accelerated work. We've chosen large overall industries,
industries that we know would beneﬁt quite quickly from an accelerated and AI
model. Thus has absorbed and created the large TAM that we have.
We started with 100 billion, probably the last time we were here on stage in these
white chairs, but we've added quite a few things that are not in there as well. Our
choice of adding software separately, adding and licensing software to enterprises
separately is not in there. Our favorite topic in terms of Omniverse is also not there in
terms of a opportunity. We also haven't included our Grace CPU, our niche CPU
that's really focused on high performance computing and AI, attached to that overall
vision that we have that it's data center computing as a whole that we'll focus on inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30

Q - John Pitzerevery single part of the data center. So the TAM, the opportunity is large. How large
will it get? It's very un -- unknown, but there are big markets out there for us.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
You brought up software and that's an area that I get a lot of questions in. And I think
last time you and I spoke oﬄine as it gets to be 10% of revenue. I think, that's sort of
the threshold that you think about breaking it out as a standalone within the
ﬁnancials. One is that rate. Two, how quickly can you get there? And I guess, third
question is what exactly are you doing? This VMware announcement on AI enterprise
software and I'm just a dumb silicon guy, I have a hard time spelling software. Can
you help explain to the audience, what software suite and tools you're actually
providing the enterprise within that JV?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. Our most recent announcements that we have discussed is the amount of
software that we have available is quite large. Software is not new to what we've
been providing. We've talked about it for many years that our success has been
really that system software or some of the key things that we provide free. For
example, CUDA, 30 million downloads to 3 million developers that are out there. All
free, but it's a development platform for them to also write software. But we assist
even beyond overall CUDA and things that we bring. We bring to market AI
frameworks, application diﬀerent frameworks in the engines that we've talked about.
But now there's an opportunity for us to sell the software separately.
Now why would we? Because some of our big opportunities in front of us are
working with enterprises. Enterprises are very key in terms of the assistance that they
need. When I say the assistance, they need support. Our ability for them to have a
license that they know they can come to us and seek the support that they need for
their application is key. Our work with VMware is very important. Why? Most
enterprises use VMware. If we are incorporated in the stack that they use inside of
their IT data centers that they can see and view and model their jobs and their
virtualization of their accelerated servers in the same way that they do their CPU
servers, that's an initial important step for enterprises as well.
So it is linking them together for all of the bells and whistles that the enterprises
need. Which applications will we oﬀer separately? There are several out there right
now. Enterprise AI is an opportunity now in general availability and we are signing
up customers for them to have within their infrastructure as well. We'll talk further in
terms of Omniverse as well. That is also something that's available for the creatives
for them to do. From time to time, we'll do more. But we have 150 STKs out there. 65
of them have been revised and/or new for people to look at. But the goal is helping
the enterprises move into this world of acceleration.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
And it really is a question of which of your businesses are going to grow faster. But is
there a benchmark you can provide us with as to when you think software might
actually be a reportable segment within the model?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30

Page 6 of 12A - Colette M. Kress
Q - John Pitzer
A - Colette M. Kress
Q - John Pitzer{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
The software is a assistance in terms of helping a bigger piece out there, which is the
overall purchasing of the infrastructure. The software has a multiplier to it, which is
the infrastructure that is purchased by them. We will provide metrics along the way in
terms of what we are signing in terms of software. You will likely be able to see
pieces of it as it is still on the balance sheet and those pieces, but we'll talk about it
from time to time.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
And then if you go back three to four years ago, I think, one of the concerns in the AI
market is that you were very well positioned in training, but perhaps not as well
positioned in inference. And the view was the overall AI market at its end point
would be 25% in training, 75% in inference and there was a fear that maybe your mix
would be the exact opposite given your core IP. You've kind of changed that. Can
you talk a little bit about the inference side of the market for you? You talked about
that as being a faster growing portion or the fastest growing portion of AI for the last
several quarters. Where is it as far as the mix in your AI business? Where does it go
and is that limiter that we -- that some people thought it might have been three or
four years ago.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So inferencing and inferencing with GPUs has been extremely successful.
Probably years ago sitting in this room talking about we are going to go after the
world of inferencing that we knew was taken up by the CPU world. But we
understood that the complexity of inferencing in front of us was important that they
had both the programmability and the ﬂexibility of a platform to take on those larger
workloads. So inferencing is now growing faster than our overall data center as a
whole. And when we indicate inferencing in this thing, this would be our inferencing
processors that we have. We have some processors and platform-speciﬁc for
inferencing, but we also did a diﬀerent thing with A100. The A100 Ampere 100 was
an opportunity to provide both. You have an opportunity not only to do training, you
could take a portion of the A100 and divide it for speciﬁc inferencing types of jobs.
So even only counting the inferencing platform-speciﬁc, it is still growing faster than
our overall data center, not including the overall A100. So our overall approach to
not only providing a ﬂexible system and platform, but also all the software that we've
enabled so many diﬀerent inferencing types of frameworks out there, it has been
extremely successful.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
You mentioned Omniverse earlier. Some people call it metaverse now that Facebook
is -- has rebranded themselves. And I want to be careful how I couch this because I
would argue that Omniverse has been a background driver of your business forever.
If you think about sort of the metaverse is the interface between the physical and the
digital world, NVIDIA throughout its history has been trying to improve that interface.
You've been doing it in gaming and now you're moving into a broader space. So I'm
curious, are we at an inﬂection point in Omniverse, metaverse? Do we need AR, VR
to kind of catch up? And is there, again, I think this is a very bullish long-term trendFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30

Q - John Pitzer
A - Colette M. Kressfor you. I'm trying to ﬁgure out if it's been a little bit overhyped here in the near-
term?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. So Omniverse is a piece of technology and the next wave of technology that
we've been talking about for a couple of years. But the great thing about it is, it
brings together all of the diﬀerent pieces that we have already from a simulation and
do it collectively. Let's talk about that. So ﬁrst, when you think about RTX. RTX with
the ability to simulate light in real time. Additionally, we have done acceleration and
huge amounts of simulation for high performance computing and then you add the
piece of AI and what we have done.
Really what Omniverse is simulating accurate physics in a 3D World, 3D collaborative
virtual environment. We think that we're in a 3D world, but we're really not yet. If
you're thinking about the last 18 months, we've been focused in a 2D world with a
little screen in front of us. What if this conference will actually wasn't in person and
we had each of the digital twins out there and you and I would be our little digital
twin onto -- on stage here, that they --
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
I can't wait for the day.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I can't wait for that day as well. Okay. So Omniverse really brings together the best of
breed of everything that we have developed. Now that the architectures have
advanced over these years, Omniverse is not available. It will include VR, it will
include AR, it will do everything for collaborative us, work spaces, it will help in terms
of manufacturing and design as well.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Well, I'm curious because everyone, investors tend to be tactile creatures, if we can
see and touch something, it's more meaningful to us and it seems like where
Omniverse is really going to take oﬀ ﬁrst might be scientiﬁc and industrial simulation.
What might be the ﬁrst killer app that we in this room wake up to one day and go, oh
my god, we're here, the Omniverse is now present.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. So let's start ﬁrst though, but why is it important for manufacturing. Why is it
important for architecture. It's an important area because they spend a lot of times
collaborating across the world. Their teams are in all diﬀerent types of regions and
particularly now in a hybrid environment, more and more in terms of working from a
diﬀerent space than the overall oﬃce. The world of taking large documents to look
at a 2D design is not eﬀective anymore. One, they want to see it real time. Not when
they ﬁnished three quarters of the way through the design and then say we need to
make a change.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30

Page 8 of 12Q - John Pitzer
A - Colette M. KressThey want a single source of the truth of the design. Well, wait a minute, what version
are you on. Are you on version 17, I'm on version 5. How do they keep that design
world working? So Omniverse really helps many of these large manufacturers
collectively collaborate on a design before it becomes real, before it is something
that they have changed because that change could be rather expensive. Now you
and I in terms of what we will probably see, will be things such as bots, okay, which
we'll see call centers, which we will see places where -- where customer service be
accomplished. Those will be probably two things that would be available every
single day to us. Additionally, we'll probably have a car that will have our little
assistant inside of the car. How to get home, how to get to Judy's house? All those
diﬀerent things will also be available using Omniverse.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
I want to go back to gaming and you brought up RTX earlier. And one of the
questions I always get is, how do I model long-term gaming growth? And I went
back and looked at past the Analyst Days, and I think the last time you quantiﬁed and
I could be oﬀ, if I am, correct me. It was sort of a mid-teens type CAGR with about
half coming from units, half coming from ASPs is kind of how I thought about the
business. If you look at where you've been over the last couple of years, ﬁve-year
CAGR has been 25%. If you look at the last couple of years, it's been well above that
40% and 60%. And I think this helps to kind of form concerns that this is crypto
related and not something else. Can you talk a little bit about kind of how we should
think about the long-term growth here? How RTX is really played out units versus
ASPs? And I think, one of the most interesting data points is just the penetration of
RTX and where you are on that curve versus the prior cryptic correction with GTX?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So when we think about gaming, RTX is a very important technology that has
been brought to the world. The ﬁrst architecture that we had was that setting stone
for the ecosystem to begin the work in building out the games. Right now, the
number of games using RTX almost all new games, important high-end types of
games will be RTX.
You've seen the industry as a whole, whether they'll be working on GPUs, whether
they'll be working on consoles, focused on RTX. That gives us the ability for us to
grow not only on desktops, but also with the notebooks in that important piece. We
have the ability to upgrade a large installed base. It's not just upgrading the last
architecture, but thinking about two architectures before that did not have ray-
tracing at all. It was a very important architecture. It was very popular architecture in
terms of performance. And now when they think about two architectures,
performance improvement and RTX, it is very popular.
We will probably continue to be bigger than the overall gaming industry when we
think about our overall growth because we are supporting more than just gamers.
We are supporting creators. We are supporting broadcasters, broadcasters in a lot of
diﬀerent universes, whether they're doing AR, VR or working in terms of contractors
or enterprises. It's out there and this high-end graphics is an important piece.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30

Q - John Pitzer
A - Colette M. KressWhen we think about what is driving our growth. Is it units? Is it ASPs? Yes, it's both. It
is both. Both that upgrade, bringing on new users but also pay per ad continuing to
turn to higher end platforms to really make those purchases in the top parts of our
stack as well.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Well, one of the things I think it's under appreciated. You mentioned a couple of
times in your comments, it's just the penetration to the notebook market for discrete
graphics. Can you help us understand where you think we are on that curve because
that's been a great story for NVIDIA over the last several years? And I would argue
one of the key drivers is to why the growth rate has probably accelerated versus
history?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
It has been just an important piece, really working with the OEMs on that design,
working together with that ecosystem to help them understand, you can put just as
great as a GPU into a notebook as you can of a desktop has really transformed. If you
think about the world today and the hybrid work environment, the remoteness, that
laptop, that workstation, mobile workstation is very important. So the Max-Q
technology that enabled that has been just very key and has really assisted both
gaming, but also our workstation as well.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Do you think we're getting close to full penetration, or is there more to go in the
notebook market?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
There's plenty of places to go. I think, in the current arena with the OEMs working
with them on the ﬁne-tuning, which ones they can ship right now as we get ready for
the overall holidays is a key thing. There's opportunity additional, penetration not
everybody is on a high end GPU notebook by no means.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Not a business that gets a lot of attention, but it's a good segue with RTX, which is
ProVis. And I remember when you guys ﬁrst introduced RTX, you actually brought a
bunch of analysts into your headquarters when we were still doing in-person visits
and the pitch was really what RTX could actually do to the ProVis business. If you
look, that business has been experiencing accelerating growth over the last couple
of quarters, and I guess I'm trying to ﬁgure out, is this a reopening trade that that's
helping that business or you're actually starting to see RTX bringing down the cost of
rendering and creating just new markets and new applications? I think the one that
you highlighted when you ﬁrst introduce RTX was actually could you actually
stimulate -- simulate housing, real estate and instead of driving around and seeing
four houses in ﬁve hours, you can see 40 houses in an hour virtually.

Q - John PitzerAbsolutely. So the workstation market has had very, very strong growth over the last
several quarters. And you would say, is part of that just due to the environment that
we were in. It's really about the future environment that is creating that. The hybrid
ability for folks to have workstations both in their home as well into the oﬃce is very
important. Being able to upgrade to RTX saves them tremendous amount of time,
resources and ﬁnishes their work in so many great areas.
We've seen this both with the entertainment industry in terms of what they need to
do to create overall ﬁlms. We've helped stitch that together for their overall
rendering. You can use an example such as, real estate, but there are many examples
where creatives working on their own are using RTX to assist them and all the
creative, whether that be catalogs, pictures, all that type of things are done using
RTX. So this is a -- not a trend at the moment, but something that will probably take
us for many years.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Another end market where are your software strategy is going to start paying
dividends as autos with the announcement you made with Mercedes, I guess it's
over a year now, for 2024 autonomous driving. That -- that's been a business that's
been kind of winding down with your legacy products before it's ramping up with
your new core products. How should we think about kind of the growth in that
business as we get out into '23, '24. I think, in the past we've talked about either $5
billion or $8 billion worth of backlogs over like a ﬁve-year period.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We have been talking about our autonomous pipeline and we have analyzed all of
the companies that we have signed with in terms of creating autonomous robotaxis,
trucking or just the passenger cars such as Daimler. That market size is about 8
billion if we look out to 2027. As we see today, we're still in the early days of this in
terms of providing samples, continuing to build out the end to end platforms that
they will have in the car. So the way that you should think about that is, yes, it may
start at the end of '23, move into '24. But hit the 8 billion in total. So it will be quite an
important part in terms of how it accelerates in those ﬁrst couple of years. It's an
important part because it doesn't mean just the infrastructure that will be inside of
the car, it is also a software opportunity. We have creatively working with Daimler,
helping them on that software and we'll share the software that each -- the company
will procure from putting the autonomous vehicles inside those passenger cars.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Couple of modeling questions as we come to the end here. First is, just on gross
margins. There's a lot of headwinds in the current environment. There's inﬂation,
there's logistics. You're ramping new products. What's the longer-term sort of view
that we should have on gross margins? One. And two, as you report the January
quarter, one of the helpful things you gave us is, as you look out to the next ﬁscal
year is your OpEx. And as much as you tell guys like us not to look at an OpEx to rev
ratio and back into revenue, we inevitably do that. How should we think about kind
of the OpEx given the opportunity set that you have in front of you?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-11-30

Yeah. We still get asked quite a bit about gross margin. Probably one of those key
metrics that people look for a semiconductor company, we -- as we've discussed
here, we're diﬀerent. We're diﬀerent in terms of thinking about us from a full
platform perspective. The best thing that we've been able to do with our gross
margins is incorporate software in so many of the platforms that we're doing,
meaning, the software is not in the gross margin and that's why our gross margins
have been so successful.
We look at each of the platforms that we have put out there and the margins have
grown particularly related to data centers and people purchasing more of our high-
end cards into the market. As we go forward, probably in the distance, if software
becomes an important part, whether that be autonomous vehicles, whether it be
things that we standalone, you've got another ability to raise our overall gross
margins.
When you think about OpEx. You're right, that we tend to try and assist thinking
about our investment levels. We do not model it versus revenue. We don't. We know
the most important part of what we can do as a company is invest correctly, invest
appropriately and what enables us to build these products, bring them to market, we
will be investing, we will provide some assistance in terms of what we know we can
control. OpEx is some of the things that we can control and we'll talk about that
going forward. We have huge market opportunities in front of us. We have great
exciting ideas to do. Now it's our job to think about which ones we can fund? Which
ones are nearest to the boat, things that we need to fund today, what things longer
term we also want to. Any point in time, we have things that are providing revenue
today, things that are providing revenue a little bit more in the future and certainly
work that we're doing long-term at all times.
