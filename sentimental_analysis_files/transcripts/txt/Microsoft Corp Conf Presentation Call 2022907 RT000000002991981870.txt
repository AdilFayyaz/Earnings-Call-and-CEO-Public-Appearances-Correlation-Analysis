Good morning, everybody. I'm Tyler Radke, Co-Head of the software sector here at
Citi, and welcome to Day 1 of our Technology Conference. And we're excited to have
Microsoft. Although joining from Zoom, not Teams, I see, Corey. Corey unfortunately
had a run-in with COVID, but I hope you're doing well. And so, I really appreciate the
ﬂexibility and shout out to the AV team for making this work. So Corey, thanks for
joining us.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 22760344 <GO>}
(Question And Answer)
I thought maybe we could kick it oﬀ. Just if you could touch on your background,
your experience within the Microsoft organization. I think you've worked with a
number of leaders over the years. But just at a high level, what do you do on a day-
to-day basis?
{BIO 16695509 <GO>}
(Technical Diﬃculty)
{BIO 22760344 <GO>}
Right. And as we think about the segments that Microsoft reports to investors and
kind of the segments you look after, is it kind of fair to say commercial cloud is your
big focus area?
{BIO 16695509 <GO>}
Yes, that's right. (Technical Diﬃculty)FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07

I'll throw out all my gaming questions, I was going to ask you. So --
{BIO 16695509 <GO>}
(Technical Diﬃculty)
{BIO 22760344 <GO>}
Yes. So with the macro environment being top of mind with investors, would love to
get your perspective. Obviously you're seeing it from the lens of industry and a
massive Azure business. How would you just kind of compare and contrast the
demand environment that you're seeing now versus what you saw at the beginning
of the year?
{BIO 16695509 <GO>}
Yes. It's -- the demand remains quite strong. And I think and excited about work
(Technical Diﬃculty)
And we've seen across the full spectrum and sometimes diﬀerent by industry, sort of
where the customers are and what they're looking to solve, but it's typically looking
to solve problems with technology, trying to ﬁnd sort of simpler, faster, easier ways to
leverage technology. And again, that can either be for massive digital
transformation, being able to get new learnings, new insights and drive new
businesses. But it can also be for optimization, right, being able to take advantage of
the scalable cloud and taking advantage of a migration from on-prem to cloud to be
able to reduce the CapEx investment they may have.
And so, the opportunity to sort of look at both and the full range of our services has,
I think, put us in a good spot to be able to help customers do more with less as we
frequently speak with them about, and that again can span consolidating in our
M365 in security products or leveraging AI and ML to build new products that
they're shipping to their customers or even sort of optimizing their developer
resources by taking advantage of low code, no code platforms to be able to expand
how many people can develop. Which in some ways, as we look at resources across
all of our customers, it spans from obviously both the macroeconomic environment,
but even the job market and the developer market and sort of the ability to do more
with less. And so across all these facets, I'm pretty excited about what we have to
oﬀer.
{BIO 22760344 <GO>}
Great. So maybe we could ask that question more speciﬁcally on Azure. So cloud
consumption has been a big topic among investors. Some of your peers and
partners that you work with through the marketplace have talked about some
customers optimizing cloud spend. We've seen some slowdown in cloud
consumption, even on the Azure business this most recent quarter. So can you justFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 14A - Corey Sanderstalk about the consumption trends you're seeing in Azure? And how are customers
approaching this managing or optimizing cloud spend topic?
{BIO 16695509 <GO>}
Yes. I think -- I mean, in general, I think the conversation with customers that we have
is, ﬁrst of all, looking across the full Microsoft Cloud and sort of looking across all of
the capabilities that we have and how they think about both their spend in an on-
prem way and spend in a cloud way. And so, when we think about sort of Azure
speciﬁcally, it also deeply intertwines with Oﬃce, with Teams, with our Security Suite
D365 and again, like I mentioned, Power platform.
And so, as we work with customers, oftentimes it is a conversation over what is the
most optimal way to leverage the services, again taking into account what they're
already running, what services they're already using, consolidating some of those
with some of our services. And then, of course, reviewing their services with us and
understanding if they're optimizing across those services.
And so, it is a common conversation that we have, but it's very much focused on the
customer and the solutions they're trying to drive. While certainly sort of
optimization is a hot topic, it is always in the context of the business goals that are
being achieved. It's rarely in sort of optimization for the sake of optimization. And so,
we do have that opportunity, that diﬀerentiation at Microsoft to be able to put
solutions together, to be able to put those products together, to be able to drive the
right end state for a customer. Whether it be sort of the reduction of one side and
expansion of another side or sort of the opportunity to sort of leverage all of the
services and perhaps remove some of point services that may be increasing their
overall cost.
And so as part of that, what I think has been really exciting is our role has really sort
of changed as we work with customers on this, because we have this [ph]press and
because these conversations are coming up pretty regularly. Our opportunity is
shifting from less of a sort of an IT vendor and much more of a strategic partner. We
have the ability to sort of solve some immediate needs, while also partnering on
longer-term strategy changes, which many customers are obviously still thinking
about.
That changes how we sell, and I would get to be a part of this on the front line with
Judson on just how we think about selling the full Microsoft Cloud versus selling sort
of point solutions. The opportunity, of course, when customers look at that full
Microsoft Cloud is broad savings versus looking sort of point by point at potential
savings therein.
It also sort of changes a little bit of what we've built. And that's sort of again where
my new team comes in and sort of what I've been excited to build is around
leveraging the combination of these services and solutions. Again, to be able to
drive value by getting the best of these services spanning left to right. And that
opportunity then certainly reduces their overall spend by being able to takeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 14Q - Tyler Radke
A - Corey Sanders
Q - Tyler Radkeadvantage of that, and sometimes and frequently improves their top line as well by
being able to create new value by putting these services together.
And so, this is where I do think we have this unique opportunities, unique role to be
not just seller of solutions and thus get sort of into the deep conversations over price
per core, but actually also have the opportunity to really be the strategic partner for
these customers and work through what are their goals, what are their strategies and
then what services do we have that can help them get there. And that's, I do think
we're -- the breadth of our services puts us in such a better spot to have these
conversations and drive the right outcomes for customers.
{BIO 22760344 <GO>}
Great. And if we think about the numbers that you report on Azure, I think the last
time we saw a more notable slowdown was during the pandemic in early 2020. How
would you contrast those conversations with customers and the drivers of that
slowdown then versus what you're seeing now? And how are you thinking about
kind of the trajectory of Azure throughout the rest of your ﬁscal year?
{BIO 16695509 <GO>}
Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think the slowdown at the early part of the pandemic was
certainly a bit more of a knee-jerk reaction, I would say. I think that there was sort of
immediate reactions and immediate sort of taking stock of the situation, which drove
some quick responses and then changes in plans where necessary. I think given this
is, to your point, sort of a pretty diﬀerent conversation because it is more of a macro
conversation. This is where, again, the conversation is slightly diﬀerent for us. It is a
lot less about sort of immediate opportunity because of immediate anxiety, but more
again around that long-term strategy. What are the beneﬁts and stages that the
customer needs to go through? What needs to happen in the next 12 months, what
needs to happen in the next 12 years.
And that is where I think our conversation becomes much more interesting, because
we can actually sort of, as mentioned, drive those broader strategic conversations.
Customers are not looking necessarily for quick ﬁxes. They're looking for the ability
to have that partnership to be able to drive the longer-term change. And that's
where sort of all of our opportunity across the Microsoft Cloud, how we sell, how we
build, all become quite advantageous to us and our partnerships with these
customers. And that's, I think, a little bit of how I would equate them to being
diﬀerent. I think the sort of the fear of the initial one, it was very diﬀerent than, I think,
the sort of strategic approach that I've seen from customers today.
{BIO 22760344 <GO>}
Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And so, if we think about what you're seeing by region,
obviously, diﬀerent parts of the globe are in diﬀerent stages of cloud transition. They
have more data centers versus cloud. I guess, how are you seeing kind of the
regional performance diﬀer? And in regions that may be seeing more of a slowdown
from a macro perspective, are they prioritizing cloud more or less? Just give us a
little bit of regional commentary in the context of cloud versus on-premise?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 14A - Corey Sanders{BIO 16695509 <GO>}
Yes. I think, I haven't -- from sort of my role, I haven't seen necessarily a speciﬁc
regional shift or speciﬁc regions who are seeing notably increased slowdown from
others. One of the interesting things about sort of a global business and the fact that
so many of our customers are global customers, they end up obviously having sort
of a global deployment strategies and global deployment enablement. And so, we
do still see quite a bit of demand pretty much everywhere in the world. And so, I do
think that's been interesting. As sort of, of course, this macroeconomic environment
continues, it will be something for us to watch. But so there's not been a notable
region shift from my perspective.
I will say, as sort of you mentioned about the on-prem point there, one of the big
opportunities and sort of places that we spend a lot of time focusing is around
enabling value for customers' on-premise, right? And in some ways, our Hybrid and
Edge strategy really focused on this, where there are good reasons for customers to
deploy and continue to deploy in an on-prem environment. That is sort of our
agnostic, I think, to the macroeconomic environment. And this is where I do think
some of the beneﬁts that we really focus on in the team with our hybrid solutions,
one. Enabling customers to operate their on-premise environment as an extension of
the cloud, so that being sort of simple policy, simple security controls and
consistency between sort of their on-prem and their cloud environment. It allows
them to sort of continue to take advantage of their on-prem investments and even
sometimes expand their on-prem investments without necessarily sacriﬁcing some of
the beneﬁts that the cloud can bring.
We also see a lot of focus on Edge as part of this. And so again, separate maybe
from the macro environment, but probably more aligned to some industry-speciﬁc
areas where we see sort of Edge and sort of proximity needs are actually increasing
sort of how we deﬁne on-prem spend by putting sort of additional servers in either
storefronts. I always joke sort of the server on the oil rig to be able to sort of take
advantage of some of the cloud power, whether it be AI, ML or solutions running
analytics at the Edge and still take beneﬁt from the cloud capabilities behind the
seats. And so, this is, again, where some of our services like Azure Arc or Defender
for a cloud can really oﬀer that uniﬁed support security.
And the last one actually that we're seeing from an on-prem perspective, and this
may sort of be more of a regional push, frankly, has been certainly on the
government side. And this is where when we look at sort of our recent
announcement from a Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty, which we just announced
here a couple of months ago, the focus is around enabling governments to be able
to deploy in any way that makes sense for them, right?
And this -- certainly, government spend and government digitalization has been on
the rise, which is exciting. And so, oﬀering opportunity to be able to take advantage
of public cloud where it makes sense and some of our sovereign capabilities, and
our policy and governance controls, while also taking advantage of on-prem where it
makes sense and being able to put it into their sort of environments and being able
to leverage cloud capabilities, again, like Azure Arc to manage it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 14Q - Tyler Radke
A - Corey SandersSo that's been one where we're seeing a little bit of both, and I do think we'll
continue to see that as part of again, a sovereign and a government-based
deployment. And certainly, there's more regions where that's sort of growing and a
greater interest. Certainly, Europe has been a very hot area for that type of
deployment, but we are seeing that globally as well.
{BIO 22760344 <GO>}
Yes. And I think the on-prem piece is interesting in the context. I mean, we also just
heard from Michael Dell in the keynote, we talked a lot about Edge computing. But
we have actually seen really robust on-prem server growth at Microsoft. It's remained
in positive territory despite the really strong growth in Azure. So I guess, how do you
kind of think about the steady state of that growth? Is that given that we are going to
be in this hybrid environment going forward? And to your point, some industries like
government are really investing there. Is that kind of a sustainable rate? Or do you
think as Azure gets bigger, that business starts to decline eventually?
{BIO 16695509 <GO>}
I mean at this point, I think there's no indications of it necessarily declining. And
obviously, Michael Dell talked here, I don't want to disagree with him. But no, I think
there's no indication of it declining. I think what -- as we continue to see sort of
customers, they're expanding the amount of solutions and digital transformation that
they're doing. And so, they're expanding the amount of technology and digital
capabilities that they're purchasing part of their budget.
And so, that certainly means that sort of the on-prem spend, I believe, will continue,
especially when you look at some of these unique requirements, and in fact even
expand in some of these requirements. As we sort of look at the opportunities, I'll
use Edge as an example, because I -- again, my focus being on the industry side. As
we look at some of the opportunities with frontline workers, with the opportunities
around checkout list, storefront, et cetera, there's actually more technology that's
being shipped to these Edge locations to these storefronts to be able to drive
business and drive value for their end-customers. And of course, that's retail.
But it does span pretty much every industry and every business where Edge has
become a really critical component for growth. And so, I think that's going to drive a
lot of these purchases and a lot of the additional sort of on-premise spend. And then
certainly, sort of sovereignty and the desire to be able to have data or servers within
proximity is also continuing to see growth. And that is, of course, government, but
there's also industries that are regulated and thus also follow some of the
requirements of those governments. And we're seeing those opportunities too. This
is where I feel like that even with partnerships like with Dell, the opportunity for us to
bring services to be able to support that management in a consistent way, to be able
to oﬀer security in a consistent way. This is what actually is one of the most important
aspects of hybrid is consistent security, and this is where services like Defender for
Cloud or Sentinel oﬀer that level of consistency.
And then even bringing our cloud services to be able to run in an on-premise way.
This is something we've invested pretty heavily to oﬀer PaaS services that can thenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 14Q - Tyler Radke
A - Corey Sandersrun in those environments and on that on-premises-based solution. So I think that we
will continue to see that on-prem server usage. And I think actually, we'll be able to
take advantage of it or customers will be able to take advantage of it with more
advanced and enhanced services and capabilities.
{BIO 22760344 <GO>}
Great. Great. And I do want to talk on industries in a moment. But maybe just starting
high level, because you did talk a little bit about the commercial booking strengths
that we've seen in the last few quarters, really, really robust numbers. I guess from
your perspective, what are some of the product or packaging or maybe go-to-
market tactics that have helped drive these large commercial bookings and large
contracts? I think last couple of quarters, you've seen north of 30% commercial
bookings growth on pretty tough compares, which has been pretty impressive. So
what are kind of the -- what's driving that?
{BIO 16695509 <GO>}
Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think even just adding a little bit to some of the points that I
mentioned earlier, a lot of it is around us working with customers as that strategic
partner. As we sort of work with them on how we're reshaping their future through
digital information. Those large commercial bookings are almost never sure IT
conversations, right? Certainly, they involve the IT conversation, they involve the IT
spending priorities, (Technical Diﬃculty) development, new business opportunities,
new solutions that are being built. And that, again, is where our positioning as
strategic partner allow us to have that broader conversation that spans again that full
set of workloads.
This is also where our go-to-market shift, really focusing, and this is something that I
think Judson has done amazing work from a go-to-market perspective as sort of our
Chief Commercial Oﬃcer, focusing on the full Microsoft Cloud. There's no customer
that we want to focus on just one of our products. And that go-to-market push, I
think, has driven a lot of that opportunity on commercial bookings, whether it be sort
of a combination of Azure and Teams and Oﬃce and Security and D365, that's sort
of bringing these things together has been really powerful.
And it drives back into engineering. This is where, sort of, again, I think the
opportunity in engineering to bring these components together, right? Each of these
teams are constantly looking for ways to add value to the other's product. Because
we all know that the sort of collection is really what bringing real value as customers
put these products together to solve their problems.
I also maybe add one key point as well is as we sort of look at all those products and
look at sort of how we sell and how we build, I do think the ﬂexibility as well of
contract has really helped, right? This allows customers to be able to use this -- their
commitment on a wide variety of services and requirements. And so, the Azure
commitment allows you to, of course, use Azure services, but it also allows you to use
key partner services like Azure Databricks and Azure NetApp Files. And even sort of
supporting a recent announcement from Power Platform that is integrated now
directly into the Azure experience and oﬀering a pay-as-you-go model. This type ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 14Q - Tyler Radke
A - Corey Sandersﬂexibility is really quite powerful for customers and allows them to, again, look
forward as that strategic partnership over the potential to use any of these services
to be able to achieve their outcome.
{BIO 22760344 <GO>}
Yes. And I do want to hit on the partners in a moment, but maybe we could talk
about the verticals and industries, because that's in your title. So there's a good
question for you. So maybe help us understand what is Microsoft's industry or
verticalization strategy, both how you're building products maybe that are built
speciﬁcally for certain industries and then how you're organizing your go-to-market
team to go out and sell those products to those industries?
{BIO 16695509 <GO>}
Yes, deﬁnitely. The biggest thing with our industry strategy is around accelerating the
time to value for customers. This is really a pivot for us as a company, and I've been
super excited to be on the front lines of this. They really are about taking that
Microsoft Cloud vision that I've talked about, but bringing sort of engineering and
marketing and sales together to oﬀer true vertical solutions that will enable
companies to sort of unleash their value, right? It's about sort of changing the way
they approach some sort of long-standing problems or challenges that they have.
We have six industry-speciﬁc clouds to-date. Those include healthcare, retail,
ﬁnancial services, manufacturing, non-proﬁt and sustainability. We also have
additional industries that we work deeply on like energy, telco and mobility. The
whole goal behind industry cloud is they're sort of extensible on top of our
horizontal services, right? So they allow you to bring together multiple horizontal
services to add value and solve industry problems. And given the combination of
our collaboration and our business apps and then, of course, our infrastructure and
data, we have a great array of sort of problem-solving solutions that sometimes need
help to put together to be able to oﬀer that end-to-end value for those business
leaders in a given company or industry. And that's, I think, where the industry cloud
really comes in.
It's also a big focus on -- and I know you said we'll talk about it later. So I won't go
too deep now, but it is a big focus on ISVs and partners as well, and being able to
enable partners to add industry value directly with us for end-customers.
Some of the examples of sort of work that we've done that I get particularly excited
about. Patagonia is a good example. They ended up closing sort of at all of their
operations at the start of the pandemic, right, to keep employees safe. When they
reopen, they end up using the Microsoft Cloud for Retail to launch a new way to
engage with customers. And again, bringing services together, they brought D365,
Dynamics 365 and Teams to basically create a more advanced connection points
with their customers and oﬀer more seamless customer experience that they could
deliver.
And so, this included sort of distributed order management. So sometimes local
stores, they turned into sort of many warehouses and sort of bringing together.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 14Q - Tyler Radke
A - Corey SandersSome of the challenges that we see from retail as an example of sort of their online
business and their in-person business and sort of enabling employees to continue to
work while also reducing maybe their online -- excuse me, their in-person business
into support for their online business. Right? And so that opportunity to sort of
switch and quickly tweak things was a power that was added as part of the
partnership that we had with them. And of course, Teams being used connected
across all those stores oﬃces and warehouses and coming together to oﬀer that
value.
Another sort of good example that I'll call out as a company called Group Bimbo,
which is work that we've done on the sustainability side. This is sort of, again, a
recent GA that we announced for Microsoft Cloud for sustainability. And if you're not
familiar with Group Bimbo, they are an international producer of big snack goods.
I'm sure if you've been in sort of Latin America, you've certainly seen this available all
over the place.
Their goal is that they only use renewable energy and eliminate their carbon
emissions and waste entirely, which of course, as sort of a producer is not good, it's
quite challenging because they certainly have lots of trucks that are going around
and delivering their services. And so, they adopted the Cloud Sustainability to be
able to collect, track and analyze their emissions, so that they can develop solutions
to be able to reduce and understand all of the emissions impact that they have and
basically had immediate impact without much extensive training to be able to make
changes and tweaks to support their goal of reducing and eliminating carbon
emissions.
So it's been a great partnership as well. But those are sort of examples of really sort
of taking the technology we've got and enabling vertical-based capabilities to solve
those end business goals, which those customers are really striving to solve diﬀerent
based on industry and based on time line.
{BIO 22760344 <GO>}
Great. And I wanted to just ask you about two industries in particular before we
move on to partners. But one that's I think is topical is healthcare, obviously, with the
Nuance acquisition. Maybe if you could kind of articulate your view of the healthcare
industry. Are you expecting future M&A there?
And then secondly, some customers or some of your partners have actually called
out a digital-native cohort, which I know Microsoft is more known for traditional old-
world enterprise. But how do you kind of see Microsoft serving kind of these newer
start-ups, VC-backed companies, digital natives going forward? And is that an area of
focus for you?
{BIO 16695509 <GO>}
Yes. Great questions. So from a healthcare perspective, I think the Nuance
acquisition and the opportunity that I've had to work with the Nuance team has been
fantastic, right? I think that their -- both their depth in sort of healthcare speciﬁc
knowledge, solving sort of healthcare problems, coupled with their deepFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 14understanding of AI and ML and voice recognition, and transcription and so on, has
been fantastic. They've been a huge asset to join the eﬀort, and I have great respect
and opportunity to be able to learn from them.
I think that the -- all up, from a healthcare perspective, we have a lot of opportunity, a
lot of opportunity both to help build these -- build upon these solutions that Nuance
has already built. But then also, lots of partnerships, lots of opportunity to grow and
expand existing partnerships that we have in healthcare. Especially as we look at sort
of -- certainly, the pandemic feels like it's coming to a close, I say ironically, as I sit
virtually because I have COVID myself. But certainly, I think the focus on the
pandemic has diminished, but I think some of the expectations on healthcare have
not. The expectations for virtual care, the expectation to be able to get doctors to
support you without having to drive into their oﬃce, and a lot of the shifts around
sort of surrounding experiences, whether it be hospitals or direct patient care and so
on.
I think there's a lot of opportunity to continue the digital transformation. This is
where one of my favorite partners that I talked about when I talk about healthcare is
Teladoc. Teladoc, if you're not familiar with Teladoc Solo, it's a leading provider of
virtual health solution. And they are a great partner that I have the privilege to get to
work with. And they have basically built their entire communication platforms entirely
on Teams as sort of the underlying platform. And this is such a great example of
where our solutions, our horizontal capabilities can empower and enable sort of
industry-speciﬁc solutions that would be built on top.
And so the combination of Teladoc and bringing together capabilities like Nuance
and then, of course, our horizontal and industry-speciﬁc solutions, I think healthcare
has a great opportunity for us to continue to expand and then, of course, grow our
partnerships. So that's maybe a longer answer than you had expected on healthcare,
but there you go.
And you've expressly mentioned M&A. There's no sort of announcements around
M&A at this point in healthcare. But I think we have so much opportunity in
partnership at this point that I'm just really excited about what we can do there.
For your second question, absolutely. I think -- and this gets a little bit into sort of a
deeper discussion on partners. One of the things that when we look at industry
speciﬁcally, certainly, I feel good about the Microsoft Cloud being industry-leading
when it comes to horizontal technology solutions. I feel when you look at sort of
each one of the spaces that we're in across Microsoft Cloud, whether it be business
apps or infrastructure, data analytics, AI, ML certainly market-leading, and I'm bullish
on the capabilities we have.
But I also have a huge amount of humility for the fact that we are not experts in every
industry. We are not experts in understanding exactly what's needed across each
industry and our ability to do partner -- to partner with technology providers and
technology solutions, whether classic technology solutions or existing companiesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 14Q - Tyler Radke
A - Corey Sandersthat are shifting to becoming technology companies. Or as you mentioned, sort of
start-ups and sort of digital natives who are oﬀering sort of net new technology
solutions.
Our sort of ability to go partner with them, learn from them, right, no matter where
they are in the spectrum of size and value and be able to support them with our
horizontal capability, sort of be their digital COGS, while they expand and build out
their vertical solutions for end-customers. It becomes such a great opportunity for us
to build those (Technical Diﬃculty) Microsoft Cloud capabilities, whether Azure, Infra.
Security is a big one, right, oﬀering our security services to these partners is a great
opportunity as well.
And so to (Technical Diﬃculty) sort of start-ups. Sort of one example would be
Schlumberger, who is sort of a massive provider of services in energy and oil and
gas, which we've done sort of deep partnership with in building out solution
capabilities to oﬀer experiences for their end-customers. And it's been sort of a
wonderful partnership and excited to be in. But of course, they've been in the
industry for a very long time and, of course, have that expertise.
And then there's AiFi, which is sort of A-I-F-I, if you're looking for the spelling, which
is actually a newer company, a potential Schlumberger for sure in the retail space,
sort of really focusing on checkout list -- checkout-free, excuse me, technology. And
that's another one, where we basically have been able to go deep with them and
partner deeply on their technology, their solution, and support them with whatever
horizontal capabilities they need, again, whether infra or data analytics, et cetera,
even aspects of the user experience with the Power Platform.
Those types of relationships are fantastic. They are now powering 80 stores with this
new computer vision technology that they built out, and we're super excited to be
able to support them as part of that launch. And that, to me, is again a great example
of a true -- a digital native for sure, and being able to enable their business to grow
with sort of the shared partnership we've got and the ability to take that to retail.
Sorry, very long answer. I hope that was -- I get to talk about industry.
{BIO 22760344 <GO>}
A lot of industries to cover. So talking about partners because I know we only have a
few minutes left. But I guess, maybe the best way to ask the question -- because,
obviously, you're working with ISVs and you're working with the big SIs around the
world, and you have a huge marketplace of partners. But I guess, where are you
relying on them the most? Where are they adding the most value in terms of helping
you close deals and digitize these customer environments?
{BIO 16695509 <GO>}
Yes, absolutely. I think the two probably big examples -- the two biggest examples
I'd use, one -- well, maybe I'll use sort of three examples. There are certainly
partnerships that we have at the horizontal level, right? And so, this is sort of just aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07

Page 12 of 14Q - Tyler Radkegreat ecosystem of solutions that's oﬀering sort of joint value for places that maybe
we don't oﬀer or have sort of diﬀerent services. And based on customer choice, we
love to be able to support the full range of capabilities.
And so, this is -- we recently announced an expanded partnership with Oracle, great
partnership with SAP, Adobe. I mentioned already sort of Azure Databricks and
NetApp Files. This ability to bring sort of these partners in and oﬀer, based on
customer choice, the ability to build your app in the way you want to using our
platform and using our services. So that's been, I think, a cornerstone of our overall
vision.
Again, going back to even a little bit, I mentioned my early days of working on
Kubernetes and being able to bring Kubernetes as a service to light. Of course, now
in hindsight, everybody's got a Kubernetes service, and it's obvious. But I think that
focus on customer choice and enabling partners has been a cornerstone of our
platform, which has been really fun to be a part of.
I also think industry is a really big -- and I would say, sort of I run the engineering --
the industry engineering team, and I think we talk more about partners and we talk
about our own native-built services. I think we talk more about how we're enabling
partners in these industry solutions simply for the reason that I mentioned before.
They have the expertise. They have the knowledge. They have the ability to focus on
those very specialized industry requirements. And I think sort of approaching
industry with humility is a secret to our success here, where I think if we go in with
the understanding that we need these partners to be able to bring this value to our
end-customers, and we want these partners to bring this end value to our customers,
and are excited about being able to support them in any way that makes sense. And
so I think that's sort of the second one.
And then the third one, along the same lines and actually pulling back from a
previous conversation is Sovereignty. I think our Sovereignty opportunity is very
much partner-led. Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty is a partner-led solution. And like
you mentioned, sort of GSIs and SIs within country, really leaning in on
understanding the local partners who understand the requirements of that
government much better than we did. And so, how do we work closely with those
partners to be able to deliver that value and be able to deliver that outcome. And so,
I think that's another area where we're very heavy partner-focused and need the
partners to help us to achieve the goals we're looking to achieve.
{BIO 22760344 <GO>}
That's great. I know we only have a couple of minutes left, but I ﬁgured I'd ask a
question just on the data and analytics business, because obviously that's been one
the company has called out in recent quarters as an area of strength. So how should
we think about the Azure oﬀerings? You have Synapse and obviously the Power
Platform. In the context of your close partnerships with things like Databricks and
Snowﬂake, what are kind of the key diﬀerentiations and how are you positioning all
that to customers?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07

Q - Tyler Radke{BIO 16695509 <GO>}
Yes, absolutely. So Power Platform has such a unique position in the market. And so
its integration with all the other services, it's just value-add for customers. And so, I
think Power Platform, whether it be with other services among Microsoft stack or
partners, the opportunity for customers to leverage our low-code/no-code is quite
valuable regardless, right? And so, that includes partnerships, things like Power BI
working across all of the data providers, right? And this is something that we
continue to work on and continue to engage on Power Apps oﬀerings. That very
simple building of developer experiences with data sources that come from sort of
any of these data capabilities and connectors that support it.
And from a Power Apps perspective, just given, again, the developer shortage that's
out there, we're just seeing an unprecedented demand for companies to be able to
expand out and leverage Power Apps as part of a broader sort of movement within
company to be able to add more applications than more solutions on these various
data sources, again, whether they're partners or whether they're Microsoft ﬁrst party.
And then, of course, Power Automate, to be able to take all of that and then be able
to sort of automate the experiences, that being integrated with Teams has created a
bunch of opportunity around frontline worker experience and so on. Where again
you can abstract away sort of the complexities of the data platform, right, the
complexities of whose what data platform and instead just oﬀer that value in an
automated capability at the top.
And so, I do think the Power Platform is such a great sort of addendum to any data
and analytics story that a customer may have. And it's sort of -- doesn't matter the
analytics requirements that the customer has underneath and the services that
they're using, the Power Platform oﬀers value on top, and it's just such a great story
with customers to be able to analyze, act and automate on top of it.
I think when we look at sort of our overall data in AI and machine learning, one of the
things that's been really great with the partnerships, like you mentioned, sort of
Snowﬂake and Databricks, but there's a broader range of these sort of data partners
that we work really closely with is, again, it comes back to customer choice. There's
such a wide range of value that we can oﬀer with our services to Microsoft, whether it
be again AI-based services, ML-based services, security-based services. And so,
partnering with these key partners, these key data partners, but then enabling those
additional services around it, I think we have a great spot to be able to, again, give
customers choice and be able to continue to sort of bring value to our platform and
to their scenarios.
{BIO 22760344 <GO>}
Great. Well, I think we are a couple of minutes over, but I appreciate the time, Corey.
And it sounds like you're doing great. So hopefully, you continue to recover quickly,
and really appreciate you coming and supporting the conference virtually.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-07
