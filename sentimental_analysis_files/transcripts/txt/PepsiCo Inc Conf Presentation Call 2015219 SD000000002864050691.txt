Presentation
Well welcome everyone. Before we hear from our next presenter, PepsiCo, I want to
take a minute to recognize the past CAGNY presidents that are in the room. As you
know, CAGNY is a not-for-proﬁt group that, in good markets and bad, from the era of
smoky conference rooms to the era of e-cigarettes, has maintained its mission and
grown consistently thanks largely to the eﬀorts of its all-volunteer Board. So would
those volunteers, all past CAGNY presidents, please stand up and be recognized for
a moment? Thank you.
I'd also like to recognize especially our President this year, Rob Moskow, for all the
hard work he's done, alongside Andrew and Bryan, of course, to make this our most
successful conference ever, with record attendance, great events. And, of course,
hosting the President's party last night. Whatever we've had to address as a Board
over the past year, he's been a great listener and facilitator, always organized, always
encouraging.
Don't let his occasionally acerbic tone fool you; that's just an act. Rob stands up for
what's right; and he's been and is a great leader. On behalf of the Board and
membership, I present you with this commemorative plaque. Come on up, Rob.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19

Page 2 of 24Al CareySo now I hope you join me in welcoming PepsiCo's management team on stage.
Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO, is going to be joining the presenters on stage today
and will be available to participate in Q&A. Presenting today will be Tom Greco, the
CEO of Frito-Lay North America; Vivek Sankaran, the Chief Customer Oﬃcer of
PepsiCo North America; Kirk Tanner, the President of PepsiCo global Foodservice;
and Al Carey. Al is going to be kicking oﬀ our presentation; but before we do, let's
take a minute to thank Al and PepsiCo and everyone here for the drinks and snacks
all week. Thank you very much, guys; we really appreciate it.
Al is the CEO of PepsiCo Americas Beverages. Al assumed his role in the fall of 2011
and is responsible for overseeing all aspects of PepsiCo's beverage business across
North and South America. Al joined PepsiCo in 1981 and served in a variety of
positions across snacks and beverages, including running Frito-Lay North America.
With that, Al, I turn it over to you.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Thank you, John; good afternoon, everybody. Let me get started with the famous
slide for safe harbor. They told me I had nine minutes so I'm deﬁnitely not going to
read through it. Okay.
Today we'd like to spend a little bit of time talking to you about the concept of Better
Together, the whole notion of taking our beverage and food together as one unit
and providing an advantage for our business in the marketplace. Now, I've been with
the Company for 33 years and I've worked in both sides of the business. And I can
tell you that I've always felt it's an untapped opportunity -- but it's tricky.
Now, the companies are more alike than they are diﬀerent, in my opinion, when you
look at Frito-Lay and Pepsi. But you also have to be careful not to lose the focus on
the two individual businesses as you try to work together to ﬁnd scale advantage.
Now, I've run both Frito-Lay and also the beverages. And I can tell you this for sure:
customers absolutely want one point of contact. So that's one reason to ﬁgure out
how to be better together.
Our products are complementary. And there are lots of synergies. In IT and in global
procurement and in R&D, we've already ﬁgured out how to get synergies working
together as beverages and snacks.
But what about the commercial side of the business? Recently, Tom and I have been
able to put some new initiatives in place that I believe are starting to deliver results.
And we're going to share those with you today.
Three things are happening that's a little bit diﬀerent. Number one, we are putting all
the leaders that run in this business to -- we tried to have them work in both sides of
the business. Everyone up on the stage here has worked both in the beverage
division and also in the food division.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 24I think it gives you a better chance of being successful. I had worked in both. I
remember days where I was at Frito-Lay. And I thought we were pretty competitive --
until I came up to Pepsi and I understood what it means to be in a severely
competitive business in LRB. And on the Frito side, it's pretty challenging to have a
66% market share and to have to keep growing the businesses.
Both those experiences really build better leaders. So that's number one.
Number two, we are listening to the way the retailer wants us to serve them, rather
than telling them how we are going to service them. You'll see some new structures
in place and you'll hear about some new ideas on how we're going to go forward to
the customer and serve them better as one organization.
And third, foodservice. Foodservice is a signiﬁcant part of our business across
PepsiCo. So instead of talking about it we've moved now to one global team that
sells all of PepsiCo beverages in foodservice and snacks as one organization.
We've taken our sales organization, trained all the people on how to do both. I think
it's providing some results in the marketplace. And you'll hear about some of that
from Kirk Tanner later.
So for starters, our two businesses in North America add up to be a pretty good-
sized business. 56% of our PepsiCo global revenue comes from North America.
They're a disproportionate part of our proﬁts and cash ﬂow.
About equal mix; maybe beverages is a little bit bigger. But in most cases this
situation allows us to be the largest food and beverage supplier to most of our retail
customers. And in some cases not just in food and beverage, in total.
If you take a look, to my point, the MULO C data -- which is the IRI data, which is a
proxy for about 60% of the ACV -- PepsiCo sales indexed at 100. Today we are about
twice the size of our next-largest supplier in food and beverage.
Now being big alone isn't necessarily a good thing. But I'll tell you, it does get you a
seat at the table when it comes time to speak to your big retail customers about
strategies that are important to the overall business.
And I can tell you this. More than one of our customers have said: I've got to grow
my business with my biggest supplier. So they have a vested interest in seeing that
our business grows.
You take a look at our business from the customer standpoint, we've got two big
categories that are important to them. Macro snacks. And we have the number one
position in macro snacks; and the number two position in LRB.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 4 of 24But the center slide is probably the one that's most important. That is LRB turns for
the total category are 43; snacks are 29, when the whole food and beverage
business is 13.
Now our Frito and our PepsiCo beverage turns are actually better than those. But
when you take those turns, combined with our payment terms and our margin and
volume, we are clearly the biggest contributor to cash ﬂow for almost any customer
that we do business with.
If you look at our business on the far right from a private-label standpoint, it's a
pretty unique set of categories in that private label has only achieved about a 5% or
an 8% share of those total categories, versus 16% for the total market, which puts us
in a pretty good place.
Now I'm going to just go through two slides on the beverage business. The only
reason I'm showing these is because one of the reasons that our Better Together
approach is working better is because now the beverage business has improved in
performance. Nowhere near where I would like it to be yet; but I will tell you that the
performance has improved.
You've probably -- those of you who've heard me speak before, I've talked about this
notion of Hybrid EDV. And taking the spikes out of the promoted business in the
carbonated soft drink business. Well it's ﬁnally starting to work. Not being so deep
on holidays, not being so high every day, lessening the bandwidth. And overall the
business has gotten better.
But the thing that has really improved in the slide that you are looking at right now is
what I call our single-serve business, our on-the-go business or on-premise, all those
smaller packages. Our business for the last eight quarters has improved dramatically.
I'd also tell you that our customers make more money on these products. So they are
incented to go after it; and we make a better margin on these products as well. So
we have high hopes for these recent trends.
But one of the biggest contributors to this trend on the small packages is our
product innovation and our package innovation. Much of it has been in the single-
serve business, on-premise. And on-the-go.
Our R&D investments are starting to pay oﬀ. If you take a look at some of these
products and some of the ones that were introduced in 2014, they are on their
second and third year of good growth. We are staying with those products.
Lipton Pure Leaf, for example, is up 40% on top of 40%. And the same thing with
Kickstart from Mountain Dew.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 5 of 24The product news -- we have an unwritten rule in our team right now is that all the
news needs to be not dependent on deep discounting in take-home. We really want
to see all of our new products in smaller packages, not dependent on the 12-pack,
12-ounce cans. And the 2-liters -- and we've made more money as a result of that.
Most all of these products that we are launching this year have health beneﬁts
beyond our normal portfolio. For example, juices: sugar reduced, zero calorie. And
even portion controls. Eight of the nine products you see on this lineup up here are
products that are launching in 2015, most of them just going out the door right now.
And almost all of them have improved health beneﬁts for the total -- for the
consumer and the category.
So we have very high hopes for our product news from a proﬁtability standpoint. I'd
also tell you that in 2015, if you look at this slide right here, the two or three I'd
highlight they have the most hope for is Kickstart in a slim can; it has coconut juice
and it has 60% less sugar than a normal Mountain Dew.
You see Propel Electrolyte Water, which has got -- it's by Gatorade; it has the same
electrolytes as Gatorade with zero calories. And Lipton Sparkling Tea, which has
been a great start so far, with low calories as well. So that's a big part of our success
on the beverage side.
If you take a look at 2014, we're starting to see some results with our plans. If you
take a look at growth in IRI on dollar growth contribution to the categories, in 2014
we had four of the top six dollar growth contributors with Gatorade, Mountain Dew,
Lipton. And Starbucks; and on the macro-snack business, Tom and his team have ﬁve
of the top nine in macro snacks for 2014, giving us some good momentum going
into 2015.
Now, if you look on the right side of this chart you'll see the actual dollar growth for
our Company relative to the rest of the big suppliers that service the MULO C or the
IRI retail panel. What it shows you is that our sales as PepsiCo were up 2.6% for the
full year; and our sales were up 3.7% for the Fourth Quarter when the total food and
beverage business was slightly over 1%.
So the total dollars that we grew in 2014 were 3 times higher than the next-best
supplier for our customers. So we feel like we're making some progress. I don't think
we're anywhere near where we could be. But I see a formula for success on Better
Together that's likely to deliver some good results in the future.
I mentioned earlier that each of our leaders needs to spend time in both sides of the
business so they have a better understanding of those two diﬀerent businesses
going forward as we try to do more Better Together work. The ﬁrst one is our next
speaker, which will be Tom Greco. Tom is the CEO of Frito-Lay North America. But he
spent time as the EVP of the commercial side of the business in beverages. He was
President of Canada.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 24Tom GrecoHe and I have worked together for 25 years. And I'm proud of the great leadership
he's done. Taking over for me, I told him he had a low bar to jump over; but he's
doing a terriﬁc job with Frito-Lay's business.
We have Vivek Sankaran in the middle. Vivek is a McKinsey veteran. Came in to be
the Senior Vice President of Global Strategy at PepsiCo. I convinced him to come
down to Frito and become part of the operating team.
He went on to become the Chief Customer Oﬃcer of Frito-Lay; now the Chief
Customer Oﬃcer of all of PepsiCo North America. And it's great to have him on the
team. Both guys with both sides of the business.
Then ﬁnally, Kirk Tanner. I remember Kirk when he was just signing on from college
recruit at the Frito-Lay business. That is a picture of him when he graduated from
college, I think. We're going to have to work on that picture, Kirk.
But we've had him at Frito-Lay US; Frito-Lay Europe; he came back to Frito. And now
he's been moved over into the global business for foodservice. And he's leading
that now, which includes both the beverages and the snacks.
So we have a great team. We've got a lot of experience in both. And I think it's going
to wind up paying dividends as we move forward on this Better Together. So now let
me introduce my good friend and partner, Tom Greco from Frito-Lay North America.
{BIO 15063682 <GO>}
Well. Good afternoon, everyone. It's been just a pleasure for me to be able to work
with Al Carey for these past 25 years. In the last several months we've literally had
hundreds of visits with diﬀerent customers across the country; and I've got to tell you
-- I'm sure you all see this. Any retailer out there today, any food service operator out
there today, they are looking for growth.
And believe me, that chart we just showed is really important for them, to see
companies that are going to drive growth for them. Al and I basically connect on this
virtually every single day; and thank you, Al.
I'm going to talk about how we build on the performance that we just showed,
leading the industry in absolute growth in 2014. And do it again in 2015. At PepsiCo,
we really beneﬁt from the balance, a very thoughtful balance, of focus and scale.
When it's time to focus, we know exactly what it takes to win in each respective
category. At the same time as all of you know, in today's world scale leverage is very
important. So as examples, the Pepsi and Tostitos brand teams know their consumer
intimately. And they take advantage of scale to leverage properties like the NFL to
drive performance.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 7 of 24From a cost perspective, we have productivity objectives by business: units per hour,
bags per minute, cases per hour. And we leverage PepsiCo's scale in procurement,
back-oﬃce, go-to-market. And information technology.
Finally, as Al referenced, we have very focused price/mix plans by brand: Pepsi,
Gatorade, Lay's. And we leverage scale through PepsiCo's sharper insights, to
understand how our brands interact together at the point of purchase and at the
point of consumption.
Of course, the Better Together agenda really starts and stops with the consumer. In
fact, the incidence of co-purchase between salty snacks and liquid refreshment
beverages is higher than peanut butter and jelly. That's because snacks and
beverages occupy common demand spaces.
We've reviewed our demand space framework with you previously; I know you've
seen it. The goal is to really understand the drivers of choice inside each demand
space as it applies to food and beverage.
For example, both Pepsi and Tostitos focus on the Fun Times Together demand
space. This occasion is a social occasion; it involves friends; and fun is really the
priority for this occasion. So we go very deep to understand it and capture the
growth potential inside Fun Times Together.
This includes a forced ranking of the attributes that we know drive performance
inside the demand space. This knowledge informs our entire growth agenda: our
brand building, our innovation, our in-store and in-market execution. And it is all
fueled by the productivity agenda that we construct to drive it.
Allow me to review our plans for 2015. First of all, we continue to invest in our brands
across all of PepsiCo. Our plans build on successful legacy programs. And we
encourage our young marketers to unlock new ways to engage consumers.
This year one of the most powerful brands in the world is celebrating its 50th
anniversary, Gatorade. Gatorade will give consumers the chance to win one of 50
epic athletic experiences that only Gatorade can deliver. Top-tier prizes include
chances to train with Dwyane Wade, Serena Williams. And Peyton Manning.
Let's take a look at our Gatorade heritage spot. video playing [ph] It's very exciting
for us. And as a matter of fact, PepsiCo is also celebrating our 50th anniversary this
year.
Next, we were thrilled with the marketing impact that we had during this year's
Super Bowl. For example, 2015 was the ninth year of our Crash the Super Bowl
campaign for Doritos; and of course, this is our consumer-generated advertising
campaign.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 8 of 24Here's the winning spot on Super Bowl Sunday. video playing [ph] I think we've all
protected that middle seat in one way or the other over the years. But this one took it
to another level.
Of course, Pepsi was hyped for halftime this year with a spot that ran throughout the
NFL season into the playoﬀs and ultimately the Super Bowl. Here's the spot that was
shown at halftime to introduce Katy Perry's outstanding performance. video playing
[ph]
Finally, Tostitos is the Oﬃcial Chip of the NFL. We had some fun with another chip
with this mostly digital campaign. video playing [ph]
So we didn't just come to Super Bowl this year; we literally took over the town. For
the entire month, the PepsiCo teams executed and delivered. Our brands were front
and center, with our Pepsi image blanketing the Phoenix skyline and right beside the
Tostitos Party Boulevard, which was big, bold. And very impactful.
Of course, the game concluded with the traditional Gatorade Bath for Bill Belichick,
coach of the New England Patriots. It's a beautiful sight, particularly for Patriots fans
and for all Gatorade fans.
Our customers understand PepsiCo's investment in the NFL and provide
tremendous support as a result. In summary, we continue to make big investments in
our brands; and secondly, the Super Bowl is the ﬁrst of several Better Together
events that we will run through the year.
Now let's talk innovation. As Al referenced, we had an excellent year on innovation in
2014. In 2015, we'll build on this momentum.
On snacks, we rolled the Tostitos Rolls! and Tostitos Dip-etizers, which I understand
are selling well from the back store in here. We're also launching a product on
Doritos called Roulette, where we have an extra spicy chip in the bag -- several extra
spicy chips in the bag -- but you just don't know which one is extra spicy and they all
look the same.
At Quaker we launched a diﬀerentiated three-SKU lineup of Quaker Steel Cut
oatmeal. The steel cut segment is growing rapidly and the Quick cook lineup has
fortiﬁed our share position.
Al talked about the strong beverage innovation on Propel, on Kickstart. And the
other products you see pictured. Brand building and innovation are critical building
blocks in our growth model.
Let's talk about execution capabilities that allow us to bring this great innovation and
our great brands into the marketplace. We are providing our world-class salesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 9 of 24Vivek Sankaranorganization with rigorous selling processes and best-in-class tools and technology
to win in the marketplace every day.
To eﬀectively plan our business, we leverage a mobile digital playbook that aligns
priorities, segments customers and stores. And integrates activation. We sell
leveraging store-level insights to execute custom assortment, custom marketing. And
custom displays. And ﬁnally, we evaluate by reviewing sales and category metrics to
assess performance and enable continuous improvement.
What makes these brand-building, innovation. And execution investments possible is
a robust productivity agenda. Productivity is an overwhelming priority for all of our
North American businesses and for all of PepsiCo.
Within supply chain, we continue to expand GES. GES is a huge unlock for us,
enabling more SKU capacity, fewer facilities. And reduced inventory levels. The
exciting part about GES is it is both a productivity generator and a growth enabler.
In addition, we continue to leverage automation. This includes automating
packaging, case picking. And forklift transportation. Third, we are continuing to
optimize our network across all of PepsiCo.
Finally, over the past several months, Al and I have really elevated the focus on some
big ideas that leverage PepsiCo's scale. We're elevating our game with three Better
Together territories in our commercial agenda: customer management, ecommerce.
And foodservice.
Vivek Sankaran will take you through customer management in ecommerce. And
Kirk Tanner will take you through foodservice. But I will tell you that both of them are
bringing a tremendous level of intensity and really a new dimension to our thinking
against these three big opportunities for PepsiCo. Vivek?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon. I'm going to take a few minutes here to tell you
what we do with our customers to generate the $1 billion of growth that you saw us
deliver last year in 2014.
The number of customers that you see here, for a number of those customers there
we were the number-one contributor to growth in food and beverage. That kind of
growth on a consistent basis gets us exceptional access to the leadership, to the C-
suite of our customers.
What we do, we go through every year something we call a joint business plan with
our customers. Imagine many, many months of work that leads to a one; to two-day
working session where we accomplish several things with them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 10 of 24First and foremost we reinforce their conﬁdence in our brands. We identify what we
call demand pockets: pockets of growth very tailored for these customers. We agree
on joint targets with them, targets that we then work into our businesses and their
businesses for the next year.
We tailor our innovation launches with them. We develop very speciﬁc programs for
multiple periods during the year that are just right for them and their shopper. Very
importantly, we build commitment to execution: commitment to execution from the
merchant all the way down through to a store manager.
Now, access is ﬁne. But it's not suﬃcient. We need to have a consistent track record
of delivering the kind of growth and building conﬁdence in our customers that we
can in fact execute.
As Tom described, we have built over the years a suite of end-to-end capabilities. I'll
highlight a few. And I'll then share with you how these can manifest in the store.
First and foremost, everything we do -- everything we do -- is anchored in a very, very
deep understanding of demand. We don't talk about categories ﬁrst; we talk about
the demand ﬁrst.
By demand I mean demand at the point of consumption and demand at the point of
sale. This understanding of demand is unlocking several Better Together ideas for
us.
Now, this understanding of demand is very, very granular, too. Growth, as you know,
is very elusive. But we are squeezing it from a number of these granular
opportunities.
Because of this demand in our stores, we are getting to what we call hyper-local
assortments, extremely tailored assortments, even across street corners in a store.
We are applying very precise designs to what we put in the perimeter and what we
put in a gondola; and I'll share with you some examples of that.
We are in fact going towards custom POS material in stores. And we're not stopping
there: we have custom and tailored and targeted digital overlays that we are
bringing to shoppers in particular stores. We are pushing the capability to continue
to capture extremely granular demand with our customers.
Now, all of this will not happen without technology. As you know, we have 40,000
people out there who are implementing things in the stores for us. And this cannot
happen without technology.
We are enabling those, the front-line, a very capable front-line with new technologies
to execute these -- from what we call media-to-shelf events on a consistent andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 11 of 24integrated basis across the multiple businesses every time in a store. I'll also show
you an example of that.
I talked about the notion of understanding demand, leading to very, very powerful
and somewhat counterintuitive portfolios in stores. I'll share with you a few examples
here.
In a Dollar General, we're going to be placing in about 9,000 stores an endcap That
provides what Dollar General believes is aﬀordable luxuries to their shoppers. Okay?
Imagine a Starbucks with Quaker cups, Quaker hot cereal, Quaker cold cereal. And
Quaker bars around it.
This insight came from a deep understanding of something the Dollar General
shopper aspired to and also a nuanced understanding of what was missing,
something about the Dollar General store locations. This is rolling out as we speak.
We were also working with retailers to rethink and redesign the center store. As you
know, the center store is challenged. And we are in there helping them redesign and
rethink it.
We all know that Mountain Dew and Doritos go better together, okay? But what we
did understand is that there is -- for this particular consumer, putting single-serve
along with take-home makes a huge diﬀerence. So we're inserting those kind of
endcaps in parts of the center store.
Our understanding of the overall repertoire behavior in LRB is convincing some
retailers to try diﬀerent combinations in the beverage aisle and rethink the beverage
aisle. What you see there is an example of Starbucks cut into what might be a very
traditional beverage aisle to drive incrementality, to drive additional beverage
products into the basket.
We complement these merchandising solutions with several anchor programs. These
are anchor programs around holidays. And it might be anchor programs that the
retailer picks to do for special occasions.
These are codeveloped with the retailers. And invariably, in just about every case,
these programs pivot oﬀ multiple categories in our portfolio.
For example, we had a program last year in Dollar General called We've Got Your
Back. It ran all summer; it included Ruﬄes, Pepsi. And Tostitos.
Our salty and CSD sales were up 10% during the event. The competitive portfolio
was up 6% during that period.
We are in year four of the Dew general store program at Dollar General. And it was
just Dew until 2014; we added Doritos last year. Sales of each of these brands wereFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 12 of 24Kirk Tannerup 19%. Co-purchase during this program was up 24% for these two brands in DG.
We understood that a lot of parties are last moment, are usually unplanned. People
shop for it at the very last moment.
We developed a take-home destination with 7-Eleven for the party shopper and
overlaid a football pizza party program on top of it. The business was up 6%; the
category was up 4% in that same period.
And most recently over the Super Bowl our business with Amazon was up 75%. We
had a portfolio program there on Amazon Prime Pantry that oﬀered a whole range of
our products. And we had tremendous success.
What we ﬁnd in ecommerce is that we are not constrained by the tyranny of the
shelf. We are able to focus holistically and purely on the notion of demand.
We are most proud of our ability to bring all these capabilities together at the store
on a very large scale. I want you to imagine for a moment what it takes to execute the
picture on the left side of that page in every store, in a centralized fashion, in a very
small time window.
What you see there is a number of our brands merchandised together and brought
together with choreographed displays. And in all those cases, the plan was
approved way back when, when I talked to you about the joint business plan. So that
the stores were ready for it.
Now, simultaneously with the physical display coming together, with the DSD
organizations working together, we worked with Walmart in this case to have the
tabs, to have digital media coverage, to have our own media coverage and their
media coverage. We grew 6% in this two-week period and gained 420 million
impressions.
Our products were in fact featured prominently in their game-time commercial; take
a look. video playing [ph] They do that because they have great conﬁdence in our
ability to execute.
I hope I gave you a lens into how our portfolio wins together in retail. I invite my
colleague, Kirk Tanner, to talk to you about foodservice.
{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
All right. Thanks, Vivek. It's an honor to be able to talk to you about our foodservice
business.
Al, thanks for shouting out on my picture there. I'm the only guy on the panel here
today that had his mom send his picture in from high school, okay? All right.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 13 of 24Foodservice is an exciting space. And I just want to talk a little bit about the industry.
This foodservice is really an ability for PepsiCo to get at the consumers: where the
consumers go to eat and drink, where they go to work and play. And when they are
generally just on the go, which is happening more than ever. The industry is $700
billion strong. And it's got a 4.2% CAGR projected over the next ﬁve years.
But if you look at the industry back in 1970, only 26% of food and beverage was
purchased outside the home. By 2012, that number went to 43%. By 2020, should be
greater than 50% of total food and beverage sold away from home.
I think most importantly, foodservice channels like restaurants, workplace, rec and
retail, travel and entertainment, all those places of access are great places for
PepsiCo to grow its muscular brands. I'm going to talk to a little bit about our
approach and how we get after that growth.
Our approach is to be organized as one PepsiCo foodservice team selling the total
portfolio. This gives us scale and it also provides beneﬁt for our customers, as Al
talked about.
Our team is equipped as well with the latest technology, enabling better execution
and portfolio development, delivering the needs for our customers. When you
couple that with the technology, our Better Together selling team. And our brands
we really bring portfolio power to drive our customers' business.
I want to talk a little bit about scale and how that pays oﬀ for PepsiCo. If you think
about college campuses, there's over 21 million students on college campuses today
that we have access to with our brands. And that's only growing; enrollment is
projected to grow 13% by 2021.
In addition, important consumers are also in this space, of course. 43% of 18 to 24-
year-olds are enrolled in college and universities today.
So how do we get at this growth? We put a model market representative from
foodservice on a campus to service and sell and execute all of our brands, from
vending to concessions to the C-stores on campus to the bookstore on campus to
the ﬁtness center, where we're selling Naked, Gatorade, Quaker. And of course the
dining halls across campuses. This has proved to be a huge success, selling our total
portfolio on college campuses.
In addition, our customers deﬁnitely win with an all-access partnership approach. It
all starts with great pairings. This is an example of Papa John's Chili Fritos pizza
paired with Pepsi. Brilliant combination. But it doesn't stop there.
We are working on menu innovation with our customers. This is an example of a
menu innovation that we did with Marriott Courtyard in 875 of their locations. WeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 14 of 24also leverage Recipe Wizard, where we've created over 80 recipes with 12 of our
brands to give to our customers to drive excitement on their menu.
Our customers are also talking to us about customization to drive traﬃc and
excitement. And we're delivering on that as well. If it's unique fountain beverages,
we deliver that. Mixology in restaurants and bars, we are delivering on that.
I've also included an example of a culinary execution that we did in LA at the Staples
Center, with a Tostitos Cantina. It is just doing tremendous. Just fun ways to bring our
brands to life where consumers are and where they are on the go.
So what does this lead to? It leads to our promise. Our promise is to provide the very
best of PepsiCo, to create really customer value and drive our business. And we do
this in four ways: of course, brand building, innovation, execution. And productivity.
It all starts with brand building -- brand building in products and formats speciﬁcally
designed for this unique foodservice space and away-from-home channel. We are
delivering on these packages.
Our customers are looking for solutions that are eﬃcient to keep their food costs
down and can be executed with ease. We have solutions, like Pop-n-Go [ph] for our
C-stores.
We have Quaker solutions for our travel partners, that you can take Quaker on the
go. And we have new equipment platforms that drive variety and choice and
engagement. All very exciting, focused on meeting the consumer where they are.
Breakthrough innovation we know drive our customers' business. And Taco Bell is a
great example of this. Taco Bell has continued to develop on the platform of Doritos
Locos Tacos, which I know we've talked to you in the past. But because they have
stuck with that innovation, they've sold well over 1 billion Doritos Locos Tacos.
In addition, we've paired that with six new fountain beverages to match up with their
menu items, including a proprietary new Sangrita Blast designed to go with their
foods. And we're not just done with that; we've got a pipeline of innovation with
both our Frito-Lay and our beverage snacks to help drive excitement at Taco Bell.
Lastly, Mountain Dew Baja Blast is still a signature beverage after over 10 years. It was
launched in 2004 and has more than doubled since that time and continues to
perform excellent at Taco Bell. It is the number-two beverage only to brand Pepsi.
Another example of how innovation really comes to life is the 7-Eleven partnership
that we did this last year. We paired Doritos Loaded, this new innovation, with a new
Mountain Dew Solar Flare to drive excitement. This is an example of a Doritos
Loaded-Mountain Dew Solar Flare store takeover, okay?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 15 of 24This is a ﬁrst for us. We had to really bring our very best to get 7-Eleven to partner
with us in this fashion.
But with this program we delivered 617 million positive impressions. We sold 3.2
million Doritos Loaded servings in the ﬁrst 30 days; and the Doritos snack portfolio
inside 7-Eleven grew 13% at the same time.
It was a tremendous success. And we were awarded by 7-Eleven at their annual
meeting with the Proprietary Beverage Supplier of the Year, the Innovation Leader of
the Year. And the Digital and Social Marketer of the Year. 7-Eleven is a great partner
to drive innovation. And we continue to do that today.
I got another example of a great partner. And this is where execution manners. We
partnered with Buﬀalo Wild Wings to drive traﬃc and excitement in their restaurants.
We've done that in several ways.
One, it starts with fantasy football. Football is critical to the success of Buﬀalo Wild
Wings. And we made it even more important by partnering with brand Pepsi and the
NFL. In addition, when they are going to open a restaurant up in Times Square, we're
out there to partner and celebrate that to drive traﬃc and excitement for the
restaurant.
Lastly, only at PepsiCo could you do something like this, where you launch a Ruﬄes-
inspired chip, inspired by Buﬀalo Wild Wings hot sauce. With that we've created 38
million retail imprints just by launching that product. Been a smashing success.
A couple other expectations of customers is to drive excitement with the brands in
the right way. We were excited to partner with SLS Hotels in Las Vegas at their grand
opening. And we did it in a way where we brought our brand activation with Pepsi to
meet the experience that their customers were looking for and to ﬁt their brand.
We developed several mixology items, sharing new ways to enjoy PepsiCo products.
It also increased awareness, of course, for our customer and drove our performance
as a foodservice business. By doing this we created 33 million incremental positive
impressions for our partner.
Talk a little bit about our equipment. Our equipment platforms -- we have a range of
equipment that meets the needs of our expensive customer base, ranging from
eﬃcient equipment to high-engagement equipment. We continue to innovate on
our equipment platforms, from lean equipment for low-volume customers, to healthy
vending equipment to drive our total portfolio in the marketplace. And our
interactive, highly engaging equipment that provides an amazing amount of choice.
That's our foodservice business that we're tremendously excited about driving and
capturing the growth. As I wrap up our presentation today I just wanted to reiterate
three things that we are completely focused as a team, one PepsiCo.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19

Hopefully you felt the sense of urgency around what we're doing to plan together as
one team, sell together.
And I can attest that Al and Tom are always together. It feels like you have two bosses
all the time. They are working incredibly hard to drive this with our customer base.
And it's visible leadership that goes from the top all the way through our
organization.
Finally, when you plan together, you sell together, you execute together in the
marketplace, our customers win. And ﬁnally, when you pull those three things
together, you win together. And you win together with our customers and our
consumers.
Finally, just want to thank you on behalf of myself, Al, Tom. And Vivek for your time
today. And I'd like to turn the time over to Jamie Caulﬁeld for questions.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 17051951 <GO>}
Great. So we'll open it up to Q&A right now. Ali?
{BIO 15328592 <GO>}
Thanks. I have two questions. One is just if you have any reaction to the headlines
that hit from the dietary guidelines advisory committee, saying their view is that there
should be a sugar tax put in place in North America to help on obesity. So that's
question one.
Question two is -- trying to phrase this appropriately. You guys have been together
for 50 years, right? So 1965 is when Frito and Pepsi got together.
It looks like there was a lot of activity; that's great. But what were the hurdles perhaps
is a good way to ask -- what were the hurdles in place to not have this stuﬀ earlier?
Why wasn't foodservice together? Why weren't you guys having these top meetings
as much as you are now?
And if you were, why are you talking about it so much now as opposed to before?
Okay? Two questions. Thanks.
{BIO 17051951 <GO>}
I don't know, Hugh or Al take the sugar tax question; and then I think Al and Tom can
both comment on Better Together.

Page 17 of 24A - Jamie Caulﬁeld
Q - Judy Hong
A - Al CareyOn the sugar tax, we're working together as an industry with the American Beverage
Association, Coke, Dr Pepper. And us; and I think we've got a good plan moving
forward to work against of these things. Of course we don't agree that -- places that
have shortages in their budget come after this, the soft drink business.
So we are working against the productively. We have a program called Mixify that is
in the marketplace now, which talks to teens and moms about the importance of
balancing calories. We are working together on a number of projects; I feel like we
are making some progress there, working together as one.
On the other question you asked about -- here we are 50 years into it; how come we
are just getting around to doing some of this work as Better Together. Having been
around for a long time, I would just tell you that these businesses are incredibly
granular and operational; and it's hard to break away from that focus and lift yourself
up above it and make things happen.
I would say that the four of us up here have all worked in both sides of the business.
So we have an appreciation for the challenges on each side of the business and
know the right ones to go after now. I think in the past, we didn't do enough trading
oﬀ of beverage people over to snacks and vice versa.
I think we're heading in the right direction. And I think some of it starts from the top.
Tom and I are linked at the hip. We are committed to making it happen. And it's on
our personal objectives.
{BIO 17051951 <GO>}
Great. Judy?
{BIO 3773182 <GO>}
Two questions on the beverage business, Al. First, related to your energy drink
strategies, obviously the competitive implication -- if you see any -- from the Coke
and Monster deal; and is your answer really the Kickstart and really focusing on that
brand as your energy drink platform?
Secondly, obviously you've been in the industry for a long time. So you know the
trends and the evolution from the consumer perspective. Both Coke and Dr Pepper
are partnering up with Keurig Cold this fall. Understand there are some limitations
initially in how you can participate.
But just broadly, how do you see that as an opportunity? And what are some of the
ways, as you think about Pepsi participating in that opportunity?
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Okay. Let me handle energy; and then, Hugh, might throw it over to you on the
equipment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19

Q - Bryan Spillane{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Sure.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
So I'm not going to comment on Coke's business; ask them about it. What I would
say is in our business we have an energy entry in that we distribute Rockstar. And we
also have a product called AMP. Between those two we have about a 12% or a 13%
share of the business.
But we've looked at these demand spaces. And we ﬁnd that it's not so much an
energy drink; it's a demand space. And I think we can get near that demand space
and meet consumer needs with things like coﬀee, Kickstart. And other drinks that
consumers look for in the middle of the day to give them a lift. So overall the
demand space is a broader thing than just the energy business.
Hugh, what about --?
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Yes, I'm happy to jump in on that, Judy. I think a couple things on that. One, this
whole area of making it at home, we refer to it as make-my-own, we think is going to
be a slow build. We don't know that, obviously; but we think it's going to take some
time for consumer adoption on that.
Number two, we view it as an additional channel. There's likely to be multiple players
in the channel over time. And with that we expect we will be playing with all of them,
as opposed to locking in with one or another.
Three, regarding the one I think you are referring to, the limitations are pretty limited
in terms of how and when we can participate. So as this channel starts to evolve, I
think you'll see us there in a meaningful way. I don't see it as a disadvantaged
channel for us going forward.
{BIO 17051951 <GO>}
Bryan?
{BIO 2147799 <GO>}
I guess for Al and Tom, as you -- part of the presentation, if you take away from a
high level, is just you're changing the way you're serving the consumer or the
customer; and some of that is based on what the customer is telling you about the
way they need to be served. When you look, I guess, speciﬁcally at beverages, your
primary competitor is making a change in terms of the way they serve consumer,
with a distribution model that is intended to be both local but also give them some
advantages or diﬀerences in terms of the way they serve national accounts.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 19 of 24A - Al Carey
A - Tom Greco
A - Jamie Caulﬁeld
Q - Caroline LevySo I guess if that's the way that that model is going to evolve, how does that aﬀect
the way that you're thinking about your model? Particularly in beverages in terms of
franchisee, franchise model, or not; and also just the way you would be able to
compete against that if that becomes the standard that retailers are looking for.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
I would say that I like the way we're set up. About 80% of our total beverage
business is done Company-owned and about 20% is independent bottling franchise.
The reason I like the structure we're in is because when we go after productivity in
our own operating system, we can take those savings and invest them back into the
business.
And we're a decent operating Company. So I think we have a good chance of taking
those savings, moving them back into brands and into R&D. So that's one of the
reasons that I don't think you get from a pure franchise operation.
And the second thing is the customer. I think there is a fair amount of complexity
dealing with price and trying to align your entire system with the price and the
programs that the customer wants. Having been at Pepsi a long time ago when we
had a 100% franchise, very diﬃcult to go out and actually have a success with a
customer. And come back to the oﬃce and ﬁnd out now the real work starts. And
often couldn't get full alignment to align with those programs.
So I can only say what we're doing. I like the program we're in. I think it will work
better for us.
{BIO 15063682 <GO>}
Bryan, if I can build on that answer a little bit as well, because I did a lot of work two
years ago looking at diﬀerent models that could work for our system, anywhere from
obvious stuﬀ like re-franchising to some more creative channel-split re-franchising,
which is going on from what we understand elsewhere, to more interesting things
like synthetic master limited partnerships and tracking stocks and all of that stuﬀ.
The conclusion we came to after studying it for a year was this is the model that we
think is going to be most successful going forward for the reasons Al just articulated.
So this isn't just us operating oﬀ a set of beliefs. We've done the homework in a
pretty deep way. And we're pretty convinced that this is the right way to go.
{BIO 17051951 <GO>}
Caroline?
{BIO 1494597 <GO>}
Really appreciate the power of one or Better Together presentation. But on a
separate but related topic, diet cola is under so much pressure, or diet soft drinks --
CSDs I guess speciﬁcally. Regular CSD is under pressure.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 20 of 24A - Al Carey
A - Jamie Caulﬁeld
A - Unidentiﬁed SpeakerHow does this activity reverse that, or is it irreversible? And what do you think is
going on with diets in particular? Do you think it could be cheap water, or do you
really think it's the people don't like aspartame?
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Yes, I wish I knew the exact answer to that. But I would say that right now in the CSD
business, in our CSD business, Mountain Dew is doing terriﬁc. We had great growth
on Mountain Dew last year and it's continuing this year.
On the colas and the other CSDs, there is some growth now back into the CSD
sugared side of the business. And it's coming from mini cans, glass bottles, diﬀerent
packs that weren't in existence before.
And in fact, ﬂavored CSDs is growing; so that includes Mountain Dew and other
ﬂavors of products that we've got out there. In fact, our Cherry Pepsi was up double-
digit last year.
Now, the diets are way oﬀ. They have moderated a bit here recently. But I still think
it's a negative.
And the number-one thing we see from consumers is a complaint about aspartame.
Aspartame is just one sweetener. But it's the one that seems to get most of the
negatives in the press and on YouTube. And as you research it, that's where the
negatives are coming.
So I'd say that that diet business stays down for a while. We have some ideas on how
we might address it. But yes, it's a deﬁnite drag on the business.
Now, at one point when I ﬁrst came back to Pepsi about three years ago, I thought:
boy, you just can't sell enough of these other drinks like tea, coﬀee, sport drinks. And
Naked Juice to make up for the decline in the carbonated soft drinks. The answer is:
yes, you can; and we are seeing that now. So I would say that these other brands --
and then Mountain Dew contributing -- gives us a chance to grow the business.
{BIO 17051951 <GO>}
I'm going to go to John. We'll work our way across: John, Nik. And then Mark. And if
we've got time we'll keep going.
Thanks. Tom, when you guys announced GES ﬁve or six years ago or however long
that was, it seemed like it was going to be a transformational process. I guess from
our perspective it's been a little tougher to see the progress.
So can you talk about where you are on GES relative to your expectations, how that's
ﬂowing through the results? Then what's the outlook potentially for layering
beverages on top of that type of distribution model?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-19
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 21 of 24A - Tom Greco
A - Al Carey
A - Jamie Caulﬁeld{BIO 15063682 <GO>}
Sure. From our standpoint, we're exactly on track with our original plan. We are
bringing up two sites per year. And all of the key metrics that we measure with GES
we are delivering against.
We are very happy with the expanded SKU base. We are signiﬁcantly increasing the
number of SKUs that we can get out.
Of course, we eliminate basically distribution centers with GES. It enables us to ship
product directly from a manufacturing facility to a store. And that expands the SKU
capability up to as much as 1,000, literally.
Now whether we get to 1,000 is a big question in terms of the store and the size and
all that kind of stuﬀ. But we have the ability to do that and to ﬂex into multiple
categories.
So we're very happy with the growth enablement. We typically deliver what we call
premium growth that we've actually modeled into GES. We are right on that number.
Then we also are very happy with the productivity that's generated out of it with the
elimination of facilities, reduction of inventory. And the overall economics for it. So
very, very happy with GES. And it's on track.
We just put one up in Killingly, Connecticut, closer to the tri-state area. So we are
pretty excited about that particular project. And we're just going to continue to drive
it. I'll let Al talk to beverages.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Yes. We're little behind Frito on the GES. We had a separate initiative called Geo Box
and automation in our plants, which is really very similar to what Frito is doing.
It gets at the same things: reduction of inventory, reduction of ﬂeet, facilities
reduction. And also improving the jobs for the front line. So they are doing a lot less
lifting and driving.
We started our ﬁrst initiative. And instead of doing two separate programs we are
now calling it GES in the beverage business. It's very similar to what they are doing,
with a few nuances.
We began that in Baltimore last year. We've got another market coming up this year
and look forward to -- I think it should be able to deliver similar kinds of results as
Frito does.

guys keep your answers short and then we can expand on them when we go to the
breakout. So Nik and then Mark; and then I think we'll head into the breakout.
{BIO 7351672 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks. So Al, Tom, I was just curious if maybe you can provide some context on
the incentive structures between snacks and beverages, where they have been. And
if they've changed. And if there's anything you can do to tweak it going forward to
really incent both sides to work more closely together.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Well the way we have it set up now is really exciting. Essentially Vivek, Kirk. And also
Steven Williams, who reports in to us -- he heads up our Walmart team down in
Bentonville -- they essentially dual report into Al and I. So to that end they are
incented to drive the total performance of PepsiCo in aggregate. So it works really
well.
I have objectives that we have to hit and it's part of our bonus objectives. What we're
doing with the front-line sales force right now is doing some fun things that aren't
expensive but it gets people excited on working together.
For example, if the teams hit targets on Super Bowl performance growth, brand
performance on growth, they get a trip to the Pro Bowl next year. And we bring the
groups together. It's terriﬁc to watch the front-line get together. There is a lot of
power there.
But we haven't tried to manipulate the compensation structures for those front-line
people. They need to be very focused, we think.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Nik, to that point, we don't want to use the compensation structure to motivate
people to do things that don't make sense. So we're letting it happen organically:
use the compensation structure just enough to seed the ideas. And then people
catch on to the fact that working together actually gives them a better outcome and
us a better outcome.
Then it's just sort of happens on its own. So we're not artiﬁcially driving that.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Nik, I would say one other thing, though. The way the leaders behave is the way the
team behaves. If the leaders are talking it up and on the docks -- Tom visits my
facilities; I visit him. We ﬁnish each other's sentences. And I ﬁnd that our teams
behave that way also if that's the behavior the leaders project.

{BIO 3344004 <GO>}
I guess for Al and Tom, the level of spend behind FLNA and PAB is higher today
relative to sales than it was a few years ago. Can you just speak to what's -- and it's
very evident that it's working, right? So what's in place to ensure that the level of
spend will remain where it is or even go higher in future years?
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
On A&M? Yes. In 2012 when we did the reorganization we committed as a % of sales
what our new A&M budgets will be; and we have a boss that holds us to it.
Also, Hugh, on your scorecard, we see that every period. So we are committed to
leaving that level up as a % of sales.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
And Mark, if they cut it, they don't get paid for the cut. Simple.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
We can't use it as productivity.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
It's been a rule.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
And we also -- I would also add that the % has to be delivered against. But we're also
getting more working. I think you've heard that from us before; but we've moved a
lot of funds from non-working into working. And we are getting better eﬃciency out
of the working.
So as we move more into digital we get smarter about what we're doing with mobile.
All of those things have helped the overall eﬀectiveness of the advertising as well,
which is another dimension.
Well that's all the time we have. There will be more time for questions over in the
breakout. Please join me in thanking PepsiCo for a great presentation and for drinks
and snacks all week. Thank you.
