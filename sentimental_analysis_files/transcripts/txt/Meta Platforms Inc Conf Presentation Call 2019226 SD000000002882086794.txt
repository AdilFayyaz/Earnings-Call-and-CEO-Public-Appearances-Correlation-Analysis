Questions And Answers
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Sheryl, I want to start sort of looking back at 2018 and the way we sort of operate the
business now. You've talked about how 2018 was a tough year. And you said you
made some -- a fundamentally diﬀerent approach to how you're sort of managing
the business and how you think about Facebook. What changed throughout 2018
now as you look ahead?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
So 2018 was a really hard year for Facebook. And I think of it as a really important
year, because I think systematically over the course of many years as we were
building the business, we didn't put enough resources and enough investment into
preventing harm. As we were growing the business, we were very focused on all the
good it can do. And all the good it still does every single day. And I think we didn't
foresee some of the ways the platform could be abused. And that's on us. And so
what's happened in the last year is that we really are taking a very diﬀerent approach
to how we run the company. And this audience knows this better than most, that if
you want to understand what the company cares about, look where it spends its
money. And what you see from us now are massive investments in safety and
security, more than tripling the size of the teams we have working on it. The most
fundamental shifts in engineering staﬃng, which is always what matters at a tech
company I've seen since I've been there, where every single team has a security
team, has a safety team as part of its work. Big eﬀorts to decrease the spread of
misinformation, big eﬀorts to make sure people understand that it's their information
and they can use it. And for transparency. And so we're running the company in a
fundamentally very diﬀerent way. And I think one of the questions people have for us
is, can we do that while continuing to build our community? And I think our last
earnings showed that we can. So we now have 2.7 billion people using any one of
our family of app services. So that's Facebook and Messenger and Instagram and
WhatsApp. This Facebook app growth is strong. We're at 2.3 billion people using it
monthly, with 66% coming back every day, which has actually been holding nicely.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-26
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 3 of 15Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - Sheryl Kara Sandberg
Q - Brian Thomas NowakAnd a considerable increase from when I started over a decade ago, which was only
50% coming back. And so the commitment we have going forward is that we are
going to continue to make big investments to try to prevent harm on the platform
and see better around corners to prevent future harm. And we're going to continue
to invest in our community and build products people want to use and build our
business at the same time.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Understood. It's a very news-ﬁlled year. And it seems like there's still a lot of focus, at
least in investor discussions that I have, around central regulatory changes, new
regulations, things that could just change the way Facebook or online advertising
evolve. How do you think about the regulatory risk for Facebook? And sort of how is
that impacting the way you're managing the business?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
So I think we are at a really important moment, not just for Facebook. But for our
whole industry. When you look at the history of new technologies, what you see is
that often there's this period where a new technology happens. And this goes back
as far as the printing press, it goes to TV, it goes to radio, it goes to the Internet itself,
where there's a period where there's something new and a lot of excitement and a
lot of usage and a lot of celebration. And then there's a period of real concern. And I
think we are in that period of real concern, where everyone's coming together to
ﬁgure out what are the rules that are going to be written for this industry. And you
see the big question. So the big question is really what kind of Internet do we want?
And I think, we're not going to want an Internet that's out of control where anything
goes. We don't want that. There are rules and regulations we already adhere to,
there will be more. We have our own policies we've put in place. But we're also not
going to want an Internet that's too tightly controlled, where any one government,
doesn't have to be ours, is too tightly controlling what their people see, where
people don't have a voice and the ability to express themselves. That's long been
something our industry has stood against. And so we're in the process right now of
working with other people in our industry and regulators around the world about
what is the right kind of regulation. Regulation that's eﬀective, regulation that can
prevent harm while still allowing people to have free expression. And I think,
importantly, regulation that's pro-innovation, because the truth is it's actually easier
for big companies like Facebook, or other big competitors, to put in place things
that adhere to regulation than it is for start-ups. If I think back to Facebook 10 years
ago, GDPR would have been much harder for us then than it was now. And so
regulation, in its core, has to be pro-innovation so that the next Facebook can
happen as well.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes, yes. Scale. Scale matters. Dave, you made some comments to Wall Street about
sort of a broad expectation for overall revenues throughout 2019. And I know that
privacy and regulation is something that you've sort of talked about through that
lens. So maybe talk to us about how you expect privacy-related headwinds, whether
it's GDPR, Clear History, any other changes that Facebook may make to the platform
potentially impacting the business from your perspective.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-26

Page 4 of 15A - David M. Wehner
Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - David M. Wehner
Q - Brian Thomas Nowak{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Sure. Clearly, privacy is a headwind for us in 2019. It's one of the factors that's
contributing to our expected deceleration of revenue growth throughout the year.
I'd say there's sort of 3 main drivers there. You've got sort of regulatory that Sheryl
talked about, which was GDPR in 2018. And we'll continue to see impact from that. I
think the regulatory arc will be longer-term in playing out. I think you're also seeing
other factors. The other factors I'd call out is the platforms like iOS are making bigger
pushes in privacy as well. And so that has the potential impact to business. Then on
the third front, it's changes that we're making ourselves. So we've elected to roll out
GDPR-type controls globally. We've done diﬀerent moves like deprecate Partner
Categories. Later this year, we'll be launching Clear History, which will also aﬀect our
ability to do third-party targeting for those who would clear history. And so I think,
broadly, it's going to give us I think some headwinds in terms of being able to target
as eﬀectively as before. But that being said, I think we've been able to navigate this
relatively well so far. And we certainly had some headwinds that we were able to I
think do better than we expected in Q4. So I'd say the landscape is certainly
changing in the direction that makes it more challenging to grow and gives a little bit
less visibility into how it will actually play out.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
And throughout the headlines and speculation around regulatory concerns,
regulation, at the end of the day, in the Fourth Quarter, you still grew daily active
users, to Sheryl's point, oﬀ a very big base in the U.S. and Europe. And so I guess the
2-part question is, what does that tell you about your underlying user base even
through all the headlines? And how do you think about the U.S. and European DAU
growth going forward?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
So I think we've got a very compelling set of products. So just know that on
Facebook, we saw 9% MAU and DAU growth. Now that's concentrated in the
developing world, in Asia and Rest of World where we're seeing higher levels of
growth. In Europe and the U.S., I think -- I broadly characterize it as stable. I think we
grew slightly in DAU terms in both regions. But I think the outlook there is with
Facebook, we're relatively penetrated in the developed markets. So we'd expect
those to bounce around. When you -- still lots of good growth opportunities for
Facebook globally. I think more broadly. And Sheryl alluded to this, we were -- we're
thinking of Facebook more broadly in terms of the family of apps. So there's 2.7
billion people who use a Facebook product, one of the Facebook products. And we
think that, that's really the best way to think about the size of the audience we're
serving, because we now have multiple products generating revenue. And also we
think it better reﬂects the size of the audience that we have. So there's 2.0 billion
people using one of the family of apps products daily. So I think -- and we're seeing
good growth across those developed and developing markets for the family of apps
products. And Instagram is doing particularly well.

Page 5 of 15A - Sheryl Kara Sandberg
Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - Sheryl Kara SandbergAnd Sheryl, to bring you back to the Fourth Quarter. So same questions within the
advertising side. And you -- we have the headlines and yet the advertising results
were still really strong, at least, in my opinion. Can you talk through some of the
notable drivers of the strength in the advertising in the Fourth Quarter and how
those will continue as we go throughout 2019?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
When you talk about advertising, there's always the old joke "I'm wasting half my
marketing budget, I just don't know which half." And I think those days are long
gone in a sense that advertisers want ROI. Every business has a limited amount of
money, whether they're the largest business in the world or the smallest. And what
we say -- I say to clients all the time when I meet with them is, we want to be your
best minute because your time is precious and your best dollar, euro, yen, pound
you spend. And we want to help you measure all the way through from seeing an ad
on Facebook, all the way through to purchase, or whatever outcome you're trying to
measure. And I think we've been able to go to people and say we're going to help
you drive that ROI and we're going to help you prove that your advertising is
working. We announced in our earnings that we have now 7 million advertisers
across all our services globally and 2 million on Stories. And those are big numbers.
And I think it's ROI driven. And as we think about outcomes, one thing I don't think
people quite understand is it's not just DR, or direct response, advertisers who are
driven by outcomes. Increasingly, brands are as well. So if you are some of the
largest brands in the world. One other thing is a lot of them in diﬀerent verticals
don't have a direct relationship with consumers. What Facebook and social media
allows is a direct relationship with consumers, where even if they're not buying
online, they can speak directly to them, they can share their product, share their
vision, communicate who they are. But increasingly drive through all the way to, I
want to register for something. I want to show up on a lot and test a car, test-drive a
car. I want to get a coupon or I'm going to go into a store and purchase. And so what
I think the major trend is. But it's been true, I think, for the whole decade, I've been
there. And as Mark launched the ads product even before I was there, is helping
people reach the right person and helping people understand the ROI they're
getting. And I think the more measurable it is, the more people understand it, the
stronger the business will be.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. You've always said, "the right ads to the right person at the right time." And I
guess as you sort of run through the family of apps, give yourself a grade or maybe
sort of talk to the apps where you think you've done a good job of that and how has
that happened and what are at the apps where you really see the most opportunity
to sort of improve that relevancy of the right ad at the right time with the right
person?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
Well I don't know if I'm going to grade us. But I'll tell you where we are in the life
cycle which is, we've had ads on Facebook for a long time. Instagram is now big and
growing and very important contributor to our business. Messenger is much more
nascent. And WhatsApp, we don't have an ad product and that's much further out.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-26
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 6 of 15Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - Sheryl Kara SandbergBut your point on the right ads for the right products at the right time is exactly the
right one. And this is where I think we need to do a much better job of
communicating, because I think one of the things people fundamentally don't
understand well enough about Facebook. And it causes some of the problems we
see, is our business model. And Mark has published an op-ed on this. We're trying to
speak about this as often as we can and as clearly as possible, which is that targeted
advertising and privacy are not at odds. It's not just that we can do both, it's that we
do, do both. Our goal is to show anyone on Facebook, you look out on this
audience, there are people here with diﬀerent tastes, diﬀerent interests of diﬀerent
ages and even diﬀerent locations. And so if I'm a local plumber in New York, there's
probably some people -- maybe a lot of people here I want to reach. But if I'm a
baker in Houston, you want to reach someone who is in Houston. We get along very
well. But I bet we don't like the same movies. So the movie they want to show me the
trailer would be diﬀerent than the movie they want to show him. And what we enable
is marketers, the largest to the smallest, to show the right ads to the right person at
the right time. We don't sell information back to advertisers. We don't tell advertisers
who you are. But we enable that targeting and we give back aggregated
information. And it is that targeting that is explaining why, not just big businesses can
do it. But small businesses. And it's pretty important actually to local economies.
There are now 90 million small businesses that advertise -- that have presence on
Facebook. Not all are advertisers, obviously. We only have 7 million advertisers. 25
million Instagram business proﬁles and these are businesses that are reaching
audiences they want to reach. And the ones who choose to advertise with us, this
targeting allows them to reach audiences. If you're a small business, you can't buy a
TV ad even in a city and you can't put up a billboard and you can't buy a big
newspaper banner. And so it's really the democratization of access that, that
technology and that targeting allows. And we do it in ways that are very consistent
with people's privacy. And I think that's something we need to explain much better
because targeted ads are better ads, they're better for businesses, they're also way
better for people. If you're going to see 2 ads and you believe your privacy is
protected, you'd much rather see something that's relevant to you. And we need to
do a better job explaining it so that we can continue to provide the job growth that
we're providing.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. And one of the media that Mark was focused pretty early on, talking about the
importance of Stories. Stories' consumption was going to be a bigger and bigger
part of the overall platform. And last quarter, when you talked about it here and you
talked about it last quarter, you have 2 million advertisers spending on Stories. I
guess, I'd be curious to hear about what are 1 or 2 of the biggest steps that drove
that adoption of advertisers in the Stories format? And what do you see as sort of
being the next drivers to bring more advertising dollars to the Stories?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
I think what happens, both because of the way we develop. But also because of the
nature of things, is that people -- consumers move to a product before advertisers
do. The consumers were broadly using their phones many years before most
advertisers were doing mobile advertising. And we had to help those advertisers
make a shift. I think we're now seeing that with Stories. We now have 500 millionFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-26
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 7 of 15Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - David M. Wehnerpeople participating in Stories on Instagram, 450 million on WhatsApp, 300 million
on Facebook and Messenger. Those are big numbers. And Stories are a really
engaging format. So consumers are there. Then the question is how do we get
advertisers there as well so they can take an -- take this opportunity. Stories are
engaging, interesting, they do not get monetized at the rate of News Feed so we
have a lot of work to do ahead. But what we've learned is we need to make it easy
for people to move. So if you look at the history, people have done TV ads forever.
When they ﬁrst started to put TV ads on mobile, they took their TV ads and they put
their 30-second clips on to mobile and social. That didn't work as well, right? In a
good TV ad, you often have a story and right at the end the brand comes in. In a
Facebook context or an online context, you want that brand to be way earlier
because people are scrolling through and you can see really good results. It also
needs to be optimized for a diﬀerent screen. And I think as we did the last transition,
it -- we ﬁgured out later that we need to help people make that format transition. I
think we understand that now. So now rather than tell people go create a story ad,
we say, give us some pictures, some text and we'll create the story ad for you. You
don't have to ﬁgure out where you want to place it. We'll place it. We'll take the
targeting and we'll give it the best possible placement, whether that's Facebook or
across our services. So the easier we can make it for advertisers to make that shift,
the faster advertisers are going to shift to go where Stories are. And it's going to take
time because it's a big opportunity for us, because the formats are so engaging and
consumers are so engaged in Stories.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Let's sort of step back and sort of take a multiyear view or maybe multicore in the
overall case. Do you think Stories' monetization could reach parity with News Feed?
Or is that not a realistic goal?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
So I think there's always diﬀerent dynamics that go on in an auction system so that's
something that you have to look at. So right now, I would say the growth
opportunities from impressions are really shifted toward Stories right now, especially
in the developed markets. So what that means is we've got a lot of supply. So we've
got a lot of opportunities to -- for advertisers to ﬁnd people through Stories cost-
eﬀectively. The Stories is growing really quickly. Feed now, at this point, both on
Instagram and Facebook, it is levels where it's getting more challenging to grow
things like ad load, especially in the developed markets. And so you're going to see
slower growth from an inventory perspective from Feed. And there's a lot of demand
for Feed so that's going to drive price on Feed. At the same time, there's a lot of
Stories' supply growth opportunities so that's going to mitigate the impact of us
improving the ad products on Stories, which will have a -- which will bring more
advertisers to the product. But at the same time, we're bringing a lot of supply. So
those things we'll just have to see how they balance out. But certainly, we know that
we've got opportunities to make the Stories product much better for advertisers.
Bringing more format types, especially direct response-type formats to Stories is
going to be important. That's going to improve the number of advertisers that are
going to want to bid for that inventory. So that's going to, over time, I think drive up
the opportunity. In addition, there's some diﬀerent characteristics around Stories.
You're seeing stories you tend to spend less time on so you ﬂick through them reallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-26
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 8 of 15Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - David M. Wehner
Q - Brian Thomas Nowak

Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - Sheryl Kara Sandbergquickly. So that has sort of a downward pressure on price, because you aren't
spending as much consideration as you would a Feed story. But you're also seeing
more opportunities for impressions per minute on Stories. So there's some diﬀerent
characteristics. So depending on how you look at it, I think, we'll start to get to levels
that are comparable to Feed. But it'll take years, not months, to get there. And at the
same time, I think we're going to see prices in Feed -- with the amount of demand
we have for Feed products and the supply growth, we're going to see prices for
Feed going up at the same time. So I think you've got a lot of diﬀerent dynamics
going on. But good opportunities to grow both supply and demand for Stories right
now. So that's one of the things that we're excited about.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. I thought the ad impression growth that you've put up in the Fourth Quarter, the
acceleration to the mid-30s is the best that you had since 2016, really was a
testament to Stories contributing and the team is pretty healthy. So I guess, Dave,
what can you tell us sort of about engagement trends you're seeing on the Feed and
how we sort of think about the drivers of the Feed engagement and the Feed
monetization?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Yes, I think we're seeing obviously a shift toward Stories being the supply growth. So
more impression opportunity growth for Stories. I think on Feed, we're seeing a
healthy dynamic and certainly a lot of demand for Feed units. So more of the Feed
supply growth opportunity will be in places where we're growing MAU and DAU for
Facebook and Instagram. So that's going to be more in places like Asia. Then you're
going to see the developing -- the developed market opportunity growth for
impressions to be in things like Stories. Now in 2019, that's going to be largely in
Instagram, it's going to be Instagram Stories. I think beyond that, I think you're going
to see more contribution from places like Facebook. But overall, I'd say, Facebook,
from a Feed perspective, stability in the developed markets, opportunities for growth
in the developing markets. And then Stories is going to be our growth driver for
engagement and impressions.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
I want to ask you about the commerce opportunity and sort of shopping. And Mark
talked about this somewhat on the last call. You have the Facebook Marketplace. I've
personally used it to sell a 50-pound steel anchor that was in the yard of a house that
I bought...
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
How did that go?

There's demand...
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
It was $50 for 50 pounds, $1 a pound for a steel anchor. That's the going market. But
there's a lot of liquidity. Things actually -- it clears quickly. I've tried selling old shoes,
it works. Yes. So there's liquidity.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
Wow. So people want your old shoes.

Anchors and old shoes.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
You could sell anything on this thing.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Exactly. And quick. And so you have the Marketplace. And then you have Instagram
Shopping where you get introduced to diﬀerent brands, whether it's Allbirds, Dollar
Shave Club, (Maxwell), there's a lot going on in Instagram from a brand and an e-
commerce perspective. So maybe, again, sort of a jumpoﬀ for either of you. How do
you think about the biggest steps you have to take to really capitalize on this e-
commerce opportunity? And what's the monetization method? Is it advertising? Is it
search ads? Is it transactional? How should we think about e-commerce evolving
from this platform?

A - Sheryl Kara SandbergWell I can take it. I've also used Marketplace to sell. I've sold a Peloton so I may now
have gained the 50 pounds that you lost by selling your weight. So I actually sold it
to someone who's in this room.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
Did you sell your shoes with it?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
I did not. I didn't take that opportunity.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
Shoes sold without...
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
I would have done it for free. But the real opportunity near term and probably even
longer term is in advertising. Already, e-commerce is one of our largest categories.
And we continue to have great success with a wide variety of e-commerce
companies, from the largest to small start-ups. And we ﬁnd more and more
opportunities as the world evolves to serve those clients eﬀectively. On Instagram,
it's inﬂuencers who are also important in this ecosystem. So you're seeing them play
into it. But there's so many great opportunities to introduce consumers to new
brands through platforms like Instagram. Then Marketplace is a completely diﬀerent
angle where we're doing consumer-to-consumer commerce. That's also creating
opportunities for ads for people who are selling e-commerce more broadly in Feed
to be able to also sell into Marketplace. So we're seeing those opportunities come
up. As we think about where we're going to want to invest, we're going to invest in
things like Payments to make it easier for you to convert on-site to a -- for an e-
commerce company to sell directly and be able to make those ads more valuable
because they'd have higher conversion rates. So I don't think we'll be necessarily
looking at something like a payment revenue mechanism as a big driver of growth.
But more as an opportunity to make it better for connecting businesses and
consumers on Instagram and Facebook. And being able to do that eﬀectively, that
value will probably ﬂow through to more advertising opportunities for us.

If you're selling your Peloton Tread, let me know. I'm in the market. Facebook Watch,
Sheryl, I want to ask you. So Mark said he expects 2019 to be the year where Watch
becomes more mainstream. You shared some stats with us, 75 million users spending
over 20 minutes per day on the product. Maybe the question's going to come down
to, what types of content have you had the most success in driving that
engagement? And how you think about kind of premium content and really driving
more users and more time spent on Facebook Watch?

A - David M. Wehnercontent and creators to put things out there and reach audiences. IGTV came from
people -- us hearing that the 60-second limit on video in IG was too short and
people wanted to do longer-form comment -- content. And Facebook Watch was us
watching how -- try to watch a video on your phone 4 or ﬁve years ago, it buﬀered, it
was painful. Now a lot of people are doing that. And we think that's a big
opportunity for us. We've made cross-posting possible. And I think that's good. But I
also think it's good that we have 2 products out there in the market, because it
enables us to reach more creators. But also iterate and learn what works best. Watch
is much further along. And we've actually tried to seed the market with some shows
that we've helped create and helped to pay for. And it's going really well. Everything
from Tom vs Time to what I think Dave says his favorite is going to be, which is we
just picked up a Steph Curry show, which we're pretty excited about, to things like
Red Table Talk. So Red Table Talk, if you haven't seen it, you should, it's awesome. It
is Jada Pinkett Smith and her mother and her daughter doing a very honest -- 3
generations of amazing women talking about very real issues. 23 million people
have watched that show. So in its demographic, which is under 35 women, that's the
biggest talk show out there. And that's pretty cool, because it's on Watch and it's so
nascent. And so we're going to continue to invest. We're going to see what happens,
see what works. The core of what we want to do is make, not just get people to
watch longer-term video, which we're happy to do. But it's really about making the
experience social. So what's exciting about these shows and these opportunities is
the engagement you have with your audience. People can watch some of them
together if they want to, or even if you're not watching at the same time, the way
people comment, the way people engage with the creators, we think, shows the
path forward for video. The video itself is going to become more social, more
interactive. And we're excited that we're doing something to grow those
experiences.

Maybe the next show is to come. Dave. So on the -- shifting to the P&L a little bit, on
the last call, you talked about 2019 total expense growth in the 40% to 50% range.
And that's going to set us about a $14 billion increase in total expenses at the
midpoint. Talk to us just sort of about the investment priorities of where the dollars
would be spent within that money. And how does that compare to last year, 2018
versus 2019? What are the investment priorities?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Yes, I think the investment priorities are really a ﬂow-through of the same investment
priorities we've had over the last year. You're going to see on the total expense side,
ﬂow-through from the big capital investments that we've made. So that's going to
start to ﬂow through in the P&L on the cost of revenue side of things. Then in
addition, we're investing, as Sheryl talked about, in safety and security. That's a big
multibillion-dollar investment. And we think that's important for the long-term
sustainability of the business. And it's what we need to do to deliver on our mission
of bringing the world closer together. So that's core. It's part of what we need to do
to be successful and to drive value for the people who use the platform. Then we've
got our innovation investment. So I would call out things like AR/VR. We're launching
Oculus Quest this year. That's a bit more immersive AR -- sorry, VR experience. Portal,
obviously, we launched in Q4 of last year so we'll have continued investment in thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-26

A - David M. Wehnerin 2019. Then we're also doing other areas. And Sheryl talked about video. So that's
another investment area. So when you kind of bring all those things together, we're -
- it's going to be a sizable investment year, 40% to 50% growth in total expenses. We
would expect that, as we move in beyond that, we'll start to have expense growth
that is -- starts to be more in line with revenue growth. But it remains to be seen.
We're still early in planning out how future years are going to play out. But that's at
least what we see at this point.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
We have a lot of questions about the long-term operating margin proﬁle of the
business. Now you've previously talked about operating margins sort of trending
toward the mid-30s over the next several years. When we sort of triangulate your
revenue deceleration comments with that OpEx kind of get there this year or we're
here, at least in our expectations, is that the right way to think about it? Or it's just
something that we're sort of missing from the next several years instead of 2019?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
No. I think that's -- I mean, I think we're certainly going to see the biggest impact to
margins in 2019. So that would be our expectation as well. And again, it's the big
investments that we're making and those diﬀerent margin proﬁles in some of these
other areas of growth, whether it'd be things like AR/VR, whether it be things like
video. So that also is going to have an impact on the long-term structure.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Then CapEx 2018. CapEx grew 100%. And I think you're right now talking about sort
of a 30%-ish overall step up in CapEx. What are the biggest drivers of CapEx this
year? Then just talk to us about the way you think about sort of the long-term capital
intensity of the business and even the potential for CapEx at some point to decline?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
So we're not calling for that. So just to be clear. This year, it's a big data center
investment year. So on that front, we're building to make sure that we've got the
capacity to deliver the services. That's a very long-term investment horizon for data
centers. So that's, call it, a 20; to 30-year depreciating asset. So we think it's much
better to err on the side of getting those projects going and not ﬁnd ourselves
constrained from the capacity perspective. And so part of what we're doing is
building additional headroom into the system to be able to have the ﬂexibility to
deliver against growth opportunities when we see them. We've been constrained in
the past. And we think it's best from an operating perspective to make sure that
we're doing some signiﬁcant investments to be in a better place from a headroom
perspective. So there's a cyclical element to the growth. But there's also ongoing, I
would say, secular capital intensity drivers, too. A couple that I would call out, we're
increasingly seeing growth come from Asia. So whereas four years ago, you had Asia
growing. But we're able to serve that capacity sort of oﬀ-peak with the U.S. Now
we're getting a lot of that growth without having to put necessarily capital in the
ground. Now if you look at our top 3 growth countries for Facebook, it's India,
Indonesia and the Philippines, which are all roughly on peak with each other. SoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-26

A - David M. Wehner
Q - Brian Thomas Nowak
A - Sheryl Kara Sandbergwe're building capacity more for Asian demand. And so that has diﬀerent ARPU
characteristics and diﬀerent capital intensity characteristics. Still attractive from an
investment perspective. Then we're seeing additional opportunities from the
machine learning perspective. And I think you'll probably see this across peers in the
industry as well, which is being able to put more compute behind problems and
getting ROI there. Advertising is the biggest opportunity for us there, which is just
putting more compute behind advertising. And that has additional capital intensity.
So I think you've got a couple fundamental capital intensity drivers and you also
have a cyclical component. And those 2 things have sort of combined to give us our
expectation for CapEx growth in 2019.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Then through all the CapEx and the investment, you still have about $40 billion of
cash on the books at the end of last year. You did authorize a new repurchase
program authorization in December. Maybe just sort of talk us through capital
allocation priorities and how you think about just returning more capital to
shareholders in the next couple of years.
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Well the focus really is on making sure we're making the investments to grow the
business. So ﬁrst and foremost is how do we make sure we've got the capital to
grow. Secondarily, we want to make sure that we have a strong balance sheet. We
are in the business that is an advertising business that does have potential for risk in
a macroeconomic climate that's less favorable. So we want to make sure that we're in
a good place from a strong balance sheet perspective and also be able to take care -
- take up -- be able to use capital strategically if we see opportunities there. So we
want to I think have a very conservative point of view on all of those fronts. But we
have had an opportunity, given the strength of the balance sheet and the margins of
the business, to look at share repurchases. And I'd look at those in 2 ways. One is, we
are ongoing issuing shares as part of our compensation program. So we want to
oﬀset that dilution with some amount of share repurchase. Then we see,
opportunistically, opportunities to do more than that. And so we've been in the
market from time to time. In the Fourth Quarter, we bought back $3.5 billion worth of
stock. And in the whole year, we bought back $12.9 billion. And we've got a new $9
billion authorization. And so that puts us in a position to be able to -- still be able to
look at oﬀsetting dilution as well as opportunistic going forward.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Sheryl, just to close, it was -- it's been a very news-ﬁlled year. There's a lot that's
happened. I guess, I'd be curious to hear your thoughts now. Here we're heading
into 2019, what aspect of the company do you think is still most misunderstood,
either by the press, Wall Street analysts, analysts in the room, what aspect would you
say that isn't really the way this company thinks about things or functions? And what
are your 1 or 2 biggest priorities for '19 and '20 for the platform?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-26
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 14 of 15I don't know exactly what's most misunderstood. I think there's diﬀerent
understandings for diﬀerent people. But I think our priorities are actually quite clear.
And we've tried to be very explicit about those. Mark laid them out in the last
earnings call. And there are 4 of them. And I guess understanding those priorities
would be important no matter what people's prior understanding is. So the ﬁrst is,
we want to make progress on the social issues facing our company and our industry.
We want to make sure fake news does not spread on Facebook. We want to make
sure that hate is taken down as quickly as possible. We want to make sure we can
protect elections. You never know what you don't know. But as far as we can tell,
sitting here right now, the 2018 election was a totally diﬀerent thing than 2016. In
2016, we didn't understand this new form of Russian interference. We missed it. We
had no working relationships with government. I think everyone missed it. 2018, we
had strong partnerships with Department of Homeland Security, the FBI,
governments around the world. And we are able to ﬁnd this kind of interference to
take it down. So we're going to keep making those investments. There are elections
happening around the world on all of these things every day. The second priority is,
we want to build great experiences for people. So I think the reason people are still
coming to Facebook is because it is a good experience. Most of the time for most
people on Facebook, from the kind of happiest moments in my life to some of the
saddest, Facebook has been a big part of that journey. And it's where I still
remember it's my friend's birthday, it's where I get to see pictures of their kids. I'm a
huge WhatsApp user. I really appreciate the ability to communicate one-on-one in an
encrypted, safe way with people. It's how I communicate with my closest girlfriends
now. And we're going to keep building great experiences. So the things we already
do, like WhatsApp and like Facebook and Instagram. We think messaging is big, we
think messaging is going to be more core. Then the further things out, like Dave
talked about, VR and AR. If you've ever experienced it, I think it's in such a nascent
stage and the opportunity for things to be more immersive, to be somewhere
without being them -- being there is pretty exciting opportunity. The third bucket is
we want to keep building our business and our partner businesses. And I mentioned
there are tens of millions of small businesses on Facebook, 90 million. And we've
now surveyed them over and over and over. And what they tell us is, in any one
survey, which can go from a couple of hundred to a couple of thousand businesses,
half of them are growing, hiring because of the growth they're experiencing on
Facebook. So we believe very deeply in our business model. We believe targeted
ads and privacy protection are better for people. And we believe they are
democratizing for small business. And this is why literally, probably, millions of jobs
are being created around the world in local communities. I closed out the year by
going to my hometown doing our 50th Community Boost of the year within Miami
where I grew up. And what I met there was business after business after business. It's
delicious kind of pastry and things to tortillas to someone making hats. These are
small companies that were started or growing almost entirely on Facebook and
Instagram and hiring in local communities. So we're going to keep growing our
business and growing businesses around the world. And the fourth I think goes
through to the heart of your question, which is, we need to tell our story better. That -
- there has been harm done on Facebook, there are things we didn't see. We are
working as hard as we can to protect against those harms and protect against the
future harms we don't yet understand. We understand that's our responsibility. But in
all that, I think sometimes people forget the good things that happen on Facebook.

A - David M. Wehnerher own cancer on Facebook and saved her life. Pretty incredible stuﬀ. And so we're
working hard to prevent the bad. But also to let the good stories be told so that
people can continue building the community on Facebook. In a world that people
can feel alone and people are increasingly I think looking within their own borders, I
think the connections we allow for people to have real community, to have real
friendships, to understand and see people across borders, pretty valuable stuﬀ. So
we're going to work really hard to prevent the bad and to make sure people still see
and understand and talk about the good. I think we need to do a much better job
there.
