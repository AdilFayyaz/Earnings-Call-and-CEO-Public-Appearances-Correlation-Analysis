{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Okay. Good morning, everyone. I am Mark Murphy, a software analyst with
JPMorgan. And it is a great pleasure to be here with Chris Capossela, who is an EVP
and Chief Marketing Oﬃcer with Microsoft.
Chris, thank you so much joining us.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks for having me. It's great to be here.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
I was hoping you could -- we could maybe kick this oﬀ by listening to any opening
comments you might have and maybe, more importantly, a little bit of a background
or introduction of yourself.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Okay. Great. So thanks, everyone, for -- obviously, for being here and for your
support of Microsoft. My name is Chris Capossela. And I'm the Chief Marketing
Oﬃcer and Executive Vice President for Microsoft. I'm on Satya's senior leadership
team. So I'm a peer to Amy Hood, if many of you know her as our CFO. We get to
work very closely together. And we thought it'd be fun to have me spend some time
with our big investors, obviously. And I'm also from Boston. I've been at Microsoft for
25 years, joined right out of college and had a ton of diﬀerent jobs. And it was three
years ago that Satya became our third CEO. And a month into his tenure or so, he
asked me to take on the role of Chief Marketing Oﬃcer and join his leadership team.
And it's just been an unbelievable sort of three years of having a front-row seat at a
massive, massive cultural transformation inside the company that, I think, people
have seen outside the company as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-23

A - Christopher C. CaposselaQuestions And Answers
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So let's begin with that. Let's talk about the brand perception of the company. You've
had this very long, very successful career at Microsoft. It sounds like Satya recognized
you immediately within a month and gave you this role. You've worked in Oﬃce and
productivity. You've worked in consumer and the commercial businesses. You've also
been instrumental, as well, in the retail channel. And I wanted to ask you, as a
marketer, what is it that you think customers get right about Microsoft's image and
the understanding of Microsoft's vision? Then on the ﬂip side, what misconceptions
do you think might be lingering around where you would spend advertising,
marketing dollars to try to correct them?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes, I mean, I think, by and large, the brand health is just fantastic. If you look at the
interbrand surveys or the BrandZ surveys, they'll have Microsoft on the top 3 or 4 or
5 of all brands on the planet. And that's fantastic. The competition in tech has other
companies in that top list, too. So the -- we have, obviously, our work cut out for us. I
would say that, for us, the most important thing is to really get people to understand
that Microsoft is not really focused on trying to be a cool kid. We're not focused on
some of the things that, I think, our tech competitors focus on. We're really about
empowerment. And Satya spent this time crafting a new mission for the company
with the senior leadership team, that's to empower every person and every
organization on the planet to achieve more. And so the keyword for us is really
empowerment, we're never going to worry about whether we're viewed as a cool
company. We're going to be worried about making sure that the things people can
do with our products are amazing. And the things they do are likely to be cool. If you
look at the top 100 books on The New York Times bestseller list, those -- the people
who write those and those books are amazing. The vast majority of those are written
in Word. Is Word cool? Not at all. Word is not going to be a cool tool. But man, it's an
empowerment tool. And so I think telling those stories of empowerment are really
important to us as a company. And I think that's what you're seeing us do more and
more with our marketing. Most of our marketing now has real people telling their
stories of what they're doing with Microsoft technology to transform their company
or transform how they spend their personal time. And if you were to just look at the
advertisements we run or the videos we make, the vast majority of them now have
real people onscreen saying, "Hi. I'm a New York City police oﬃcer sketch artist. And
I sketch the bad guys. And here's how I use the Surface Pen to do that. And here's
why I love it." Or, "I'm Temenos. And I'm bringing banking to every country that has a
phone. And the Microsoft cloud is making -- allowing me to do that." So we want to
really tell these empowerment stories. And if people think of us as a company that
helps power commercial business, consumers, et cetera, then, I think, we're doing
the right thing. But I love how people are viewing the company right now. It's very
positive. And the outside perspective ﬁnally matches the inside perspective. And
that hasn't been true prior to Satya taking on the CEO role. There was a real
disconnect between the inside company seeing -- how we saw each other and how
the outside world saw us. So that's been awesome, to see change.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-23

So Word isn't cool. But I will tell you, Excel is pretty cool for this audience.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes, yes. And that's what it comes down to, like, ﬁnancial people will tell you Excel is
amazing. But if you talk to somebody who's an author, they wouldn't say Excel is
amazing. They would say Word is amazing. It is all what is in -- what it does for you
makes it very important to you. But I think, from a brand perspective where people
ask me all the time, "What are you doing to make Microsoft cool?" And it's like,
nothing. I mean, nothing. We're literally doing nothing to make it cool. We're trying
to build great things. And if Surface, people love Surface, fantastic. I want you to love
it. But am I doing some metric about cool? I'm not doing any metrics about cool. We
measure: do people think Microsoft's best days are ahead? Do people -- do
Microsoft -- does Microsoft build tools that matter in my life? Is -- am I proud to use
Microsoft products? Would I recommend Microsoft to my friends and family? Those
things, we measure. No cool factor is in any measurement that we do. And that, I
think, is the right mindset for us to have. Even if someone says to me, "Minecraft is so
cool." Fantastic. I love it. It's just not the goal to make it cool. It's the goal to make it
awesome. And I love that my daughters spend hours in Minecraft instead of
watching TV or whatever. I think that's a great -- I think it's a great thing.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So if you go back -- so in some ways, there has been some real internal change,
right?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Oh, huge.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Because if you -- so if you go back in a decade, Microsoft was viewed by this
audience as being a PC-centric company. You had struggling products like the Zune
player. You had the less successful Windows launch, where you had Windows Vista.
Remember that one?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Are you kidding? Yes, I lived through it. I look like I look today because of Windows
Vista.

Q - Mark Ronald Murphy{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
But anyway -- so you look at the company today and you've got these leading-edge
technologies. You got the HoloLens. And there are incredible demos of the HoloLens
right now. It looks like it's a step ahead. You have strong advancements in AI. You
have cognitive services. You have the Azure platform. How do you think -- how has
the marketing and branding and advertising kind of evolved to keep lockstep when
the technological evolution is so rapid?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, you obviously -- we try to market what we have as opposed to any
visionary future. I'm never a huge fan of marketing stuﬀ that people can't actually go
use. And so it's one thing to do a sexy demo or give a speech that has some far-oﬀ
vision that people get excited about. But it doesn't -- I don't think you market those
things. I think those are used at important moments in time. The marketing has to be
about telling how companies can do better than they're doing today using your stuﬀ.
So we really try to focus on what's possible today. HoloLens is far more than a demo.
We have a developer edition out. We have huge companies doing amazing things
with HoloLens. So the PGA is doing some cool things with HoloLens, Volvo and
Japan Airlines and many, many companies. So that's actually a very real thing. And
that I can market. And I want to market what they're doing. Hi. how are we
reinventing learning with the HoloLens with Case Western University? How is Japan
Airlines reimagining the way training happens to service a jet engine? Jet engines
are huge. It's very expensive and hard to train people on how to service them if they
have to actually be in front of the jet engine all the time. With HoloLens, you don't.
You can actually have a regular room that you put the HoloLens on. And now you're
seeing a hologram of the jet engine. And you can have fantastic training with the
holograms themselves: moving around, ﬂipping the hologram, getting to the inside
components of the hologram without disassembling the jet engine. There are some
amazing things there. So we want to market what's real. We want to market how we
can help people digitally transform. And for me, one of the metrics of success is just
how often, when I call on a customer, are we talking about licensing Oﬃce versus
how often are we talking about how we can help you transform your company. And
boy, if you want to know the most shocking diﬀerence of the old Microsoft versus the
new Microsoft, it's how little time I spend talking about the licensing details of Oﬃce
and how much time I spend helping customers understand how they can digitally
transform their entire company on the Microsoft cloud, which Oﬃce is a major
component of. But the dialogue isn't about pricing and packaging and skewing. It's
about how do we do this cultural transformation, how do we change our business.
And that's -- that means we're in a very, very good place.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So I want to ask you what artiﬁcial intelligence is going to mean for this whole
equation. We -- many of us were just at your Build Conference, great, successful
conference up in Seattle. You demo-ed some incredible technologies, in my opinion.
There was computer vision. There was speech. There was text understanding. You, of
course, have Cortana in the portfolio. Many of us thought that the story remix was a
big hit. It was a way to take -- it takes your photos and your videos. And it will kind ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-23

Q - Mark Ronald Murphyautomatically create a movie out of them. It will put it to music. Then you click a little
button. And it will remix the whole thing and kind of -- and do it all diﬀerently.
Yes. You can pick the actor you want to be the star. You pick one of the...
It -- yes, it was incredible. You can tag them and the text will follow them. You can
turn a soccer ball in -- it'll be an exploding soccer ball. It was really incredible. So
these things demo well. But Google is also pretty hard at work on artiﬁcial
intelligence. And they're no slouch in this arena. And so I want to ask you, who do
you think has the clearest vision for AI right now? And as a company, how do you
think about building a sustainable advantage in that market?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, obviously, I'm going to say we have the best vision. And it -- that's not --
no huge surprise. I think Google is not the only one. Everybody, obviously, is
jumping on sort of the AI bandwagon. One of the things that I love about Microsoft
is just the deep amount of investments we've made in deep research. And so to do
AI well, it's not a gimmick. Like, you have to have incredibly -- an incredible team of
researchers that are dedicated to these really, really hard computer science
problems of vision, or of speech-to-text, or text-to-speech or the many, many
diﬀerent things that we're working on. And I only think there's a handful of
companies that have built the deep research talent inside the company to do this
really well. And certainly, Microsoft would be at the top of the list. Harry Shum is
super recognized, as many others are. He leads our AI and research team. But then
the -- obviously, the magic comes into how do you ﬁgure out how to apply it. And for
us, AI, I think, is broader than it is for more companies. Many companies, you take a
look at, like, IBM with Watson. It's sort of one thing. And they talk about it as one
thing. And they've done a ton of marketing on it, et cetera. But for Microsoft, AI
actually spans so many diﬀerent things we do. These cognitive services are services
that developers can use right now to integrate AI into their own applications. So if
you want to make a construction site safer using cameras, we demo-ed this at Build.
We're just using oﬀ-the-shelf cameras on a construction site that is always under
surveillance anyways for safety reasons. The cameras can do amazing things using
our cognitive services and the Microsoft cloud to identify that a dangerous piece of
equipment hasn't been put away correctly or there's a chemical spill that no one's
attending to. And having the AI to do that, those developer services exist right now.
But Microsoft also has the ability to build AI into the products that you're all using
every single day. So when you use Oﬃce, more and more of Oﬃce is going to be
driven by these AI models to make it incredibly easy for you to get started in Excel or
get started in PowerPoint, ﬁgure out what data you should go bring into your Excel
spreadsheet based on what you're doing. There's just so much that we can do that
isn't just about the developer. But that's actually about the billions of people who
use Windows and Oﬃce every day. So for us, there's multiple components to our AI
strategy. And I think we've got the broadest view of it. And you saw a lot of the press
coming out of Build saying, "Wow, we were really impressed with Microsoft's
approach to AI," which was great for us to see.

Q - Mark Ronald Murphy
A - Christopher C. CaposselaSo the structural advantage for Microsoft, it'll begin with the quality of the talent that
you have in the research labs, the commitment to the research labs, the Ph. Ds. that
you have there. But are you trying to say that there's a structural advantage in being
able to not just infuse AI into your own Microsoft technologies. But being able to
appeal to the base of developers that are going to unleash their own developer
toolkit?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes. That's right. That's right. You need to make the -- you need to make AI
capabilities available through the cloud platform. So that any developer can just
come and bring AI to their own solutions. So Azure has to be great at giving you
massive sort of supercomputing capabilities for AI. The actual AI APIs for learning
and vision and speech have to be there. Then every developer can get at them. And
we can integrate AI into our own ﬁrst-party applications. And that's where, I think,
you've got a span that's broader than what most companies will be able to do.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Okay. Now let's transition that into a little discussion of AWS versus Azure. I want to
ask you. I guess, the simple question is just, how do you position the diﬀerentiators
between those platforms from a marketing perspective? When you look at the
numbers, Amazon's footprint is larger if you're just looking at the Infrastructure as a
service. So the compute and storage, they're run-rating a little under $15 billion.
Azure is run-rating around $3.5 billion right now. But Azure is growing faster. It's
growing noticeably faster. And I want to understand. How do you make sure the
world doesn't get stuck in a mindset that this is just a commodity layer? It's storage
and compute. There's no diﬀerence between these 2 platforms and treating them
like a commodity.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Got it. First, I won't conﬁrm those numbers. So just for the record, I don't recognize
that Azure number. But I'm sure you have a model behind it. I just want to make sure
I don't say yes to that number or...
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
No, understood. We understand there is some wiggle room in the disclosures. Got it,
got it. Okay.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Big wiggle room. Anyways, I would say a couple of things. The -- one of the most
important things we hear from customers, that our approach is quite diﬀerent than
other cloud providers, is this deep understanding of the need for hybrid. A deep
understanding that the ability to write an application for the public cloud and then
be able to run it in their own data center using Azure Stack is a massive advantage. If
you want to do business in Russia, it's hard to ﬁnd a data center or cloud provider in
Russia that meets all the needs of Russia, as one example. But there are many other
examples. With Azure Stack, you can buy your own hardware. You can run it yourself
in whatever place you want to run it. And yet, you're building an application thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-23
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 12Q - Mark Ronald Murphy
A - Christopher C. Caposselaworks exactly on premise as it works in the Azure Cloud. So there's a major shipping
and tour company that has big cruise liners that take people out into the big open
ocean. And they love the notion of Azure Stack because they can write their
applications for when people are connected to the Internet, the ship is connected.
But they can also write their applications and run them on Azure Stack on the ship
when they're not connected or when it's very expensive to be connected and they
choose not to be connected. So Microsoft's really the only one who can take you
from your data center to a hybrid data center to the public cloud. And that alone is a
massive, massive advantage as big enterprise IT moves from holding on to
everything to realizing that the world is going to be a blend. And I think that
realization that the world is a blend of public and hybrid and private is something
that plays to Microsoft's strength. Then you get to the actual things we oﬀer on Azure
that are incredibly diﬀerentiated. Oﬃce 365 is built on Azure. Dynamics 365 is built
on Azure, these higher-level services that aren't about storage. The cloud storage
business is a very uninteresting business. But running full-ﬂedged machine learning
models that help companies do predictive analytics for when they should repair their
elevators. That's actually very high value that you can charge a margin for that
business. And that plays to our strengths. So Infrastructure as a service may be a
requirement. But it's not actually where we think the exciting and interesting part of
the cloud is going. That's to higher-level services that we actually feel like we can do
quite well. And you're seeing that in our growth rates. Then you can get super
technical and you say, "Hi. we have a better data center footprint than anybody else.
We're in more regions than Amazon and Google combined. We're the only public
cloud company that legally operates in China. We're the only public cloud company
that has a data center in Germany that respects the data sovereignty laws of
Germany." So those are good advantages, too. But I think hybrid is critical. And the
higher-level services, those are the ones that'll last, that are really diﬀerentiating over
many, many years.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So hybrid and higher-level services. If this whole war, if the cloud platforms war is
starting to enter a new phase, right, if we look back on it and say, Phase 1 really was
about tech ﬁrst companies. It was about Uber and Netﬂix and Airbnb and all that. If
we look forward and say, Phase 2 is going to be about enterprise IT, would you --
would it be your opinion that having these higher-level services is essentially going
to allow Microsoft to catch up and surpass AWS in that market for storage and
compute? Or would your answer be, "Well it doesn't really matter. It's all going to
come down to the higher-level services anyway."
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
I certainly think that the track record that we have in the enterprise plays well to
Microsoft's strength. The account teams that we have calling on large enterprises,
the fact that most are running their e-mail through our cloud. And e-mail, believe it
or not, has become just this incredibly important line of business system. And we
have many, many CEOs telling me, "Hi. I can deal with an SAP outage. I can't deal
with an e-mail outage for a second." So you have to have -- ﬁve 9s isn't enough for
your e-mail system. I think having that track record and that relationship where
customers trust us, they know there are going to be mistakes made. But they trust us
to respond to those mistakes really well. There's no doubt, as the data estate andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-23

A - Christopher C. Caposseladata centers move to the cloud on the enterprise side, that we have a wonderful
opportunity that's sort of ours to lose, shall we say. But I also speak to lots of
companies that are on AWS. And they tell me, "Look, today, 90% of my spend in the
cloud is AWS. And only 10% of it is on Azure. And I have a goal to make that 50-50."
And that has actually nothing to do with they believe in us more. They literally just
want balance of trade. They literally just want the ability to sort of say, "Hi. it's going
to be better for my company if I use multiple vendors here." And obviously, given
that Amazon is on the top spot and we're on the second spot, we have a lot of
headroom from simply plain balance of trade across the cloud.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Yes. So dual-sourcing for whether it's redundancy or backup or just having price -- or
pricing right. Okay. And that's going to become common.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Or pricing, exactly, negotiating power. Sure. I think that's -- without a doubt. I hear
that more and more from people. And that basically says, "Hi. we've arrived." People
see us as a real vendor in the space. And we're actually the clear #2. And so there's a
lot of upside for us.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Yes, okay. And we see that in our CIO survey work, by the way. It certainly backs up
that a lot of progress is going to be made by Azure. We have about 13 minutes
remaining. Why don't we check now for questions from the audience? We have one
up here in the front. And if -- can we get a microphone up here?
I can speak loud, too, if you want.

She's almost here. It is -- there it is.
Okay. Relative to industrial IoT, could you tell us -- talk a little bit about, because a lot
of people in the room are interested in this, what role Azure is going to play in terms
of providing Edge services? And what industry areas are you guys going to
concentrate on? So I'm very interested in that area in terms of what you're doing.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Great. Yes. So at our Build Conference, we talked about the -- sort of our world view
of computing, moving to this Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge, where the cloud
is incredibly important. But there'll be 25 billion devices that are connected and
considered smart devices in the next couple of years, according to various industry
analysts. And so there's just a massive opportunity for us to have intelligence at the
edge of the cloud that runs on these devices themselves. And lots of people like toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-23

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Christopher C. Caposselathink about the mobile phone as the device. But we see industrial opportunities on
just an incredibly wide array of diﬀerent device types. We have a wonderful
opportunity at Microsoft. And IoT is one of our fastest-growing Azure services, to
have a lot of these devices be powered by Windows and to have even more of these
devices use our Azure IoT services that allow them to do compute on the device
itself. You can imagine building a neural network on -- in Azure and then deploying it
to an Edge device that's doing something super interesting. Maybe it's a robot or a
snake that somebody's driving into a place that a human being can't crawl into to do
some sort of security thing. And that's an amazing opportunity. We think there's
going to be tons of these. I mentioned cameras getting smarter and smarter and
being able to do workplace safety, where you're building a sort of neural network on
Azure, deploying it to a device on the Edge. And that device on the Edge becomes
incredibly valuable to a company for all the things that it can do, whether it's
workplace safety, whether it's checking towers for needing to be repaired. Those
things are all super interesting to us. Retail is a vertical that we think this is really
interesting for. Discrete manufacturing is an industry, we think, is very -- this is very
interesting for. Financial services would be another one. Health care would be
another one. So 4 or 5 industries that we think IoT is particularly well suited to. And
this notion of devices on the edge of the cloud are areas where we're pretty excited
to go after. And hopefully, we'll see lots of great Azure growth. But also Windows-
embedded growth as well. As Windows powers a lot of devices you may not know
that it's powering: gas stations, vending machines, et cetera.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Other questions from the audience? We have another one right here.
Recently, there was a New York Times article on how Google has taken over the
classroom. And anecdotally, my son is in second grade. And when he does school
projects, he actually does not use Word. He uses Google Docs. And it's not his
choice. It's what the school, as a whole, uses. Is education and schools and
classrooms an important frontier for Microsoft?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes. It is. The education space is a really interesting space because there's --
everything is basically free when it comes to software and technology. The hardware
is obviously not free. But the software is. And so from a business model perspective,
you'd say, "Huh." But from a -- these are the workers of the future. These are the
CEOs and the inventors of the future. And so we think it's very important for us to
have today's students, particularly starting in middle school, maybe even fourth
grade and up using Windows and using Oﬃce and using Minecraft in the classroom,
using Skype in the classroom. We think these are really interesting opportunities for
us. I know the article you're talking about. A couple of weeks ago, we had a major
education event that Satya kicked oﬀ, where we introduced a new version of
Windows called Windows 10 S. And we introduced a bunch of hardware from our
hardware partners, including a brand-new laptop from Microsoft called the Surface
Laptop that runs on Windows 10 S. And Windows 10 S has the very important
capability of essentially being locked down. You can't download anything from theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-23

A - Christopher C. Caposselaweb on the machine. And it starts up very quickly. And it stays very clean and safe
and secure 1,000 days later after you started using it. And most Macs and Windows
PCs don't have that property. Because people can download anything, they sort of
great cruddy over time. And you have to go back and clean them up. And this is one
of the reasons that Google's had success in the education space with Chrome books
that don't have that property. So we think the combination of Windows 10 S, plus
low-priced hardware from our hardware partners, plus fantastic tools like OneNote,
which students absolutely love, like Minecraft, which helps kids to learn how to
program in the classroom, we have some real assets that Google doesn't have that,
we think, we're ready to really do a phenomenal job in the education space. And I
think that's super important. If you look broadly around the world, Windows and
Oﬃce are still incredibly strong in education. But there are countries like the U.S.
where we have a lot of room to do better. And we think Windows 10 S, great
hardware, great manageability to manage these devices, Minecraft, Skype, OneNote,
Oﬃce, we've got a really awesome story to tell. And we're going to go out and tell it
now.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
There's one back there.
You had just an in-depth comparison between Azure and AWS. Can you talk about
the diﬀerentiation you have between your AI and Google's AI, like, which one's
better? And you talked about data analytics and Google also oﬀer that. How do you
diﬀerentiate your product compared to theirs?

Yes. So Harry Shum would be a better person to answer this question than me. But I
would say that there's a whole series of tests that these AI engines get put through in
terms of who does a better job at a deeper level of understanding. And this is true
computer science. These aren't like industry benchmarks run by a Gartner, this is --
now we're talking about, "Let's go visit MIT, Carnegie Mellon, et cetera, et cetera."
And there are who people dedicate their lives to doing computer vision. And one of
the areas that we really excel in is computer vision, being able to recognize objects
in the world and not just tell you that it's a person. But actually be able to give you
incredible detail about what that person is doing, the emotions that, that person has,
what the person is looking at, if they're wearing glasses, if they're wearing a blouse,
what color is that blouse. Like it goes -- the ability for us to recognize objects goes, I
think, far beyond what anybody else has done. Now I'm sure Google is busy trying to
do better than us and we'll continue to sort of leapfrog, that is the technology world.
But I would say today, Harry would probably sit up here and say, "I'd happily
compare our algorithms around vision, text, speech, et cetera, to anybody's. And we
think they're better than anybody's in the world." You look at what we just showed
with PowerPoint. And we did this demo using, what we call, Translator integrated into
PowerPoint, where somebody was speaking to a PowerPoint slide in English and
anybody else on their phone could essentially dial in to the presentation. And you
choose the language that you want to see the subtitles in on your phone. And we
support something like 60 languages. So I'm speaking in English and on this phone,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-23

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantit's showing what I'm saying in Chinese. On this phone, it's showing in what I'm
saying in Spanish. On the screen, we're showing what I'm saying in French as
subtitles. That type of speech-to-text translation at high, high levels of accuracy, we
would say we're doing better than anybody else. I'm sure there's a slew of tests that
Google would say they're doing better than us. We're both quite good at this. But I
don't think there are 20 companies that are quite good at this. I think it's a very small
number of companies that can aﬀord to put the R&D into being really world class at
AI, just like there are very few companies that can be world class at running global
data centers. So we think it's a very small number of players, 1, 2 or 3, probably 2 or
3. And we're very proud to be at the top of that list. And we're going to ﬁght every
day. But there aren't going to be 20 of them. It's going to be a very small number. I
thought I saw a hand way in the back with a guy in the blue sweater. But maybe he
got his question answered. Any other questions?
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
There's one in the back left corner.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
I saw a phone waving it.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Yes.
Can you talk a little bit more about China? Microsoft has said repeatedly, Satya and
you just now, that Azure is the only public cloud to operate legally in China. Amazon
would disagree with that, I think. Can you go into a little more detail about what you
mean?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Well having a data center actually in China run through a joint venture with a
Chinese organization that the government recognizes, we're the only ones in the
world that do that. Google doesn't do that. Amazon doesn't do that. There are
Chinese companies that do it, of course. We're the only multinational that does that.
That's speciﬁcally what I'm talking about. Any others? There he is, yes.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
That was the one.
Can you talk about gross margin progression in your cloud business? I mean, overall
cloud makes 50% gross margins now, I believe. But can you comment on the
individual components? And how you see that over the next couple of years?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-23

Yes. That I can't comment on, the individual components. I'll get in deep trouble.
Amy will never ever let me out of the house again if I talk about the individual
components. I will tell you, I think if Amy were here, she would say, "Hi. look, the
progress that we're making, both on the cost of sale side, we're pleased with. And
also on the cost of providing the service, the actual COGS of running Azure or Oﬃce
365," we're making very -- we're making the progress that she expects us to make,
which I think is very good progress. So I think, both the cost to get a sale and the
marketing cost to acquire a customer, are headed in the right direction as well as
substantial improvements on the cost to run our cloud infrastructure. We want to see
progress on both of those things. And we are seeing progress on both of those
things. I think she'd also say, "Hi. quarter-to-quarter, you may see some lumpiness as
the investments we make in CapEx might boost a little bit this quarter when we open
up a new data center or what have you." But in general. I think we're very happy to
be on the plan that she has laid out, both from the $20 billion cloud revenue run
rate. But also from getting the gross margin to be where we want it to be. And I think
there's nothing that we see structurally that makes us feel like we can't be at the
scale that Amazon's at with fantastic -- or with very good gross margin. And I think
that answer will allow me to keep coming back to conferences like this.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
We would like that. We would like that. And on that note, we are out of time. We will
wrap up there. Chris, it's been such a great honor having you with us and thank you
for joining us.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Thank you. So much. Thank you, Mark. Nice to meet you.
