Presentation
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Welcome, everyone. I'm Brett Iversen, Vice President of Investor Relations. This is the
eighth in our series of quarterly videos focusing on strategic areas that are top of
mind for our investors. Today's discussion will cover data and AI, including our view
of the growth opportunity, our diﬀerentiated oﬀerings, and how customers are
already using our solutions today. We've brought together two of our key leaders to
answer your most frequently asked questions.
We have Jessica Hawk, who leads data and AI product marketing, and Eric Boyd,
who leads Azure AI product development eﬀorts.
As always, we'd welcome any feedback on speciﬁc topics, the format, or other
suggestions you might have after you view the video. Please reach out to our
Investor Relations team directly with any feedback. With that, let's kick things oﬀ.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Thank you, both for being here. Jessica, maybe you can lead us out with a little bit of
framing on how do we -- when you talk about data and AI together, how would you
help our audience think of those two concepts together and why we think that's
important?
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}
Sure.
So, I think you've probably heard me say "Data truly is the lifeblood of AI." And so, AI
is, without question, having just an amazing moment right now in the marketplace.
It's truly a call back to "how is your data organized?" It is a complete get-your-data-
house-in-order moment as customers get really excited about what these AI
capabilities can do for them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-20

A - Brett IversenWe -- there's some just horror stats out there about data, data growth, data sprawl,
data lakes everywhere.
The most recent one I've seen is that we're projecting 181 zettabytes of data by 2025,
which is a ginormous amount of data swirling around the ecosystem.
So for sure, just in terms of getting ready and organized to take advantage of the
moment, it is a complete call to action to accelerate your digital transformation
journey.
And so, last year, we announced the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform in
anticipation of these opportunities that we were bringing because we know that
customers need to get the data organized to take advantage.
So that's a -- think of it as the way we describe the full breadth of the data oﬀerings
in Azure that organize around operational databases, which are the data estate
systems that have been supporting apps for decades --
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}
-- analytics capability to make sense of all the data without impacting the
performance of the applications that are running on the operational data stores.
Then the governance that's required, especially with the ginormous growth of data
in the -- in our customers' environments, to ensure that the right people are seeing
the right data at the right time.
So, we organize the business at Microsoft as a data and AI unit, because truly, these
two things have to go hand in hand.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes.
Our phones have been ringing nonstop with some of the announcements lately as
well. Eric, we'll bring you in as well. And also, thank you both for spending the time
today.
One of the questions we ask in all of these sessions, given our ﬁnancial investor
audience, how would you think about the growth opportunity?
How would you help frame that for folks watching?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-20

A - Jessica Hawk{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
Yes. I mean Jessica sort of alluded to it with the technical term ginormous. Honestly,
when we think about it, this is really the most signiﬁcant, transformational technology
breakthrough in our lifetimes, which this -- that's saying something, right?
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
I mean we've lived through mobile. We've lived through the Internet. Like, the world
has changed dramatically, and we really feel like we're poised to see that happen
again with this transformation in AI.
We really feel like Microsoft is super well-positioned for this as well. I mean we have
the foundational infrastructure, everything from Azure to our developer tools with
Azure Machine Learning and our Cognitive Services, all the way up to our SaaS
oﬀerings all across the company from Oﬃce to GitHub to everything that we oﬀer.
And so, it really positions us in a really, very strong way.
So, we're really excited about the opportunities that we have here.
We also see these as additive opportunities as well. These are new things that
people are coming to us for. If you go and tell a company, "I can make your
developers 55% more productive by using GitHub Copilot," that's something they
want to go after. It saves them money, drives their productivity.
So, these are really additive scenarios to the work that Microsoft already does across
the board.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes. Ginormous works in their Excel models as well.
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
It's a -- yes.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
They're excited about it. Jessica, back to you. In terms of data and AI and its
relevance with the broader Microsoft Cloud vision, how would you help people think
of all of that together and where we're diﬀerentiated?

A - Brett Iversen
A - Jessica HawkSure. Well in the halls, you'll often hear me saying, "It's really an all-boats-rise
moment."
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}
And what I mean by that is, if you think about the Microsoft Cloud, we have our ﬁrst-
party oﬀerings, so things like Teams and Outlook and GitHub.
The neat thing about what we're doing is we are taking all of the work that Eric's
team is engineering, and we're infusing it into those ﬁrst-party products from the
get-go.
So, what does that mean?
It means that our testing cycles, our engagement loops between our engineering
teams, our internal engineering teams are our largest and probably most
challenging customer --
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
That's right. Yes.
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}
-- when you think about it.
But what an incredible opportunity from a software development life cycle
perspective, because Eric's team is getting this continuous cycle of improvement
and feedback and scale. The scale that these platforms operate at are second to
none.
So, we take that same incredible throughput and feedback loop, and then we put
that into our third-party oﬀerings, so all boats rise.
Our customers are getting tremendous AI-driven capabilities through our ﬁrst-party
products. That same technology is now available in Azure as a third-party service.
And what we're seeing is, imaginations are starting to open up now. People are
starting to really understand, this is unique. This is the biggest innovation in our
lifetime. They're seeing it and experiencing it and beneﬁting from it in their ﬁrst-party
solutions that they're using from Microsoft. And now they can go build their own
internal or customer-facing applications using our Azure services. It's truly an all-
boats-rise moment for our customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-20

A - Eric Boyd{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes. I have to think it's super comforting for our customers to hear we're using all of
the same tech that we're wanting them to embrace as well. Moving back to you, Eric,
on the, I think Jessica mentioned, Azure AI platform. Maybe you could give us a few
more details to help people that aren't as close to it as the two of you.
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
Yes, no, absolutely.
So, for us, it has always started with research.
So, we've been beneﬁted by having Microsoft Research as a part of Microsoft for
something like the last 30 years.
We've been ﬁrst to human parity in a whole number of ﬁelds in AI.
What we then work to do is, how do we bring that work that's happened in the lab
and makes a lovely research paper.
We need to now make that work for our enterprises. It needs to be at scale for all of
the things that our customers need to do.
And so, Jessica alluded to the beneﬁt that we have, we're really privileged as a
company to have so many diﬀerent businesses that we can partner with and learn,
how is this stuﬀ really working and how is it impacting businesses in a positive way?
And we then bring that into our products and make that available through Azure AI.
And so, all of this is built on the strong foundation of Azure, being able to have
access to thousands of GPUs and computers and being able to pull them together.
Then we provide developer tools. Azure Machine Learning is a layer that developers
can build and train and manage the full operational lifecycle, MLOps, of their
models.
Then, in the next layer up, we provide a suite of cognitive services, and so in areas
like vision, in language, in speech recognition, and of course, our partnership with
OpenAI shows up there. These are models that we've built, that we make available,
that customers can just go and call directly on their own.
Then, at the top level, we have Applied AI Services, where we look at the most
common patterns that we see on these cognitive services, and then we package
them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-20

A - Eric BoydSo, Form Recognizer makes it really easy to take this invoice and get it into that
database over there by using our vision services, our optical character recognition,
and things like that.
And so, putting that whole package together for developers, but then we also use all
of the breadth that we have across Microsoft.
So, it'll show up in developer platform where we'll make AI available, show up in the
Power Platform where all these AI models are available. It shows up in Oﬃce.
So, all throughout our suite of products, we're bringing AI to our customers,
leveraging this foundation that we have on Azure AI.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes. I think that breadth of oﬀering, and I'll probably come back to that in a little bit.
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
But again another area that's really kind of excited, maybe even caught our investors
by surprise at how quickly we have so many diﬀerent things out in market versus
conceptually years out.
One follow-up to one of the things you mentioned, so OpenAI partnership, again
our Investor Relations team, we get tons of questions on this.
Some of which we answer, some of which we don't.
But in terms of the importance of it and how we think about it, what can you help
share there?
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
Yes. I mean it's been a really transformational partnership for us as a company.
We see these large language models as being foundational to driving this
transformational change that we see really happening across the industry.
We realized early on that OpenAI had the same vision that we did for how you could
continue to grow and scale and make these models way more powerful by
continuing to train.
So that really formed the bedrock of our partnership.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-20

Page 7 of 20A - Brett Iversen

A - Jessica HawkAnd so, from there, we just see tremendous advantage. I mean we've renewed our
partnership.
We announced multiple years and multiple billion dollars, really to accelerate this
work going forward everything from the work that we do on supercomputers.
So, we learn tremendous amounts about how to build the right infrastructure, which
we then make available to other customers through our Azure platform, as well as
make these services available.
We really get a ﬁrst-mover advantage by being able to bring these to customers all
across our industries as well as throughout our internal products, and so tremendous
momentum there.
Then, of course, as a part of that, we're the exclusive cloud partner for OpenAI.
So just really strong beneﬁts for both companies in this partnership, and we're really
excited to see where we go with that going forward.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes. Whilst --
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}
And if I could just add onto that --
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes, please.
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}
-- for a second. I mentioned in the beginning when we were talking about what
happened in late fall, early winter. There's this interesting moment, and we have this
in other examples, mobile would be one that I would mention as well, where
technology breaks through into the consumer mindset. And Eric and I's children go
to school together.
I would argue they might be some of the most popular kids in that middle school
right now. Because their parents are somewhat associated with that amazing thing
that was launched on the Internet last year.
When I talk about customer imagination getting sparked, I think it used to be that
technology tended to follow what consumer demand was creating.
So, an example, pick your favorite app. It used to be, when companies would write
business requirement documents to go build something, back in the day it was, youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-20

A - Brett Iversenwould build everything you were going to do for the web presence, and then maybe
you'd get too mobile. It was almost always like the last part of the Word Document.
Then consumer apps started to come out, and demand -- user experience demand
went from just out in the consumer experience to, "I want the same amazing
capability and delightful experience in my -- what I do at my oﬃce too."
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Sure.
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}
And so, with the introduction of ChatGPT out in a consumer-facing way that's what I
mean by imagination getting sparked.
I think that the bar for excellence is much higher, and there's going to be less
patience with waiting for those types of delightful experiences.
So, what we're seeing is, our customers are maybe unlike with cloud when cloud ﬁrst
came out and there was some cloud adversity or concern, we're in the opposite
position, where I think people recognize there's huge value if you can create those
same delightful customer experiences with your commercial applications that
people are getting accustomed to on the consumer side.
And we're seeing it already. There's articles and news stories being written. My
favorite one is from a CNN article where they were citing that it's a real estate
agency, and the agents are saying, "I will not do my job now without ChatGPT." That
kind of speed, when you think about how fast that happened, they went out in
December, and that news article was written in January, I think we're going to just
see this massive lean-in and desire to innovate together, which is a, for technology,
it's a wonderful opportunity for all of us.
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
Yes, the energy from customers has been, honestly, like nothing I've seen on any
product anywhere, I mean --
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Across the board. Yes, right.
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
It's just really amazing.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}

But my girls are coming home from school and asking me questions about it and
talking about how they're using it with their friends. My mom's asking questions
about it.
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
Exactly.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
So you can see the --
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
The full span.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Totally. Like, and everyone has very speciﬁc case studies that are valuable to them
that really resonate, which is a great spot to be in.
So on that, it was a good segue then, Jessica. We've had -- as a very senior
marketing leader, you must have been excited about the steady drumbeat we've
continued to have in terms of rolling out services. What would you share?
I mean there's -- it's hard to pick favorites but what are some of the things that have
been resonating --
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}
Sure.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
-- that you'd share with our audience?
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}
Well I think one of my personal favorites is GitHub Copilot.
It's not just because I used to write software.
But really, it's because I think we should be very grounded in the experience or the
journey that we're all going through together, which is, this is a true technological
advancement, and I think folks are waiting a bit to see how it plays out in terms of
what's going to happen with the developer experience, for example.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-20
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 20A - Brett Iversen
A - Jessica Hawk
A - Brett IversenWhen we announced GitHub Copilot at Ignite, we were really excited about the
capability.
As a person who used to debug software all the time, I am not interested in doing
that. I never was. It was exciting to see some of that automation, but I think people
had reasonable questions about where this is all headed.
So fast forward six months, and it's pretty exciting when the GitHub Copilot
productivity stats, Eric mentioned it, 55% more productive. That's incredible.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}
But the one that really gets me is the excitement that the developers feel over their
job satisfaction. There's -- I think it's something over 74%. They feel more than 70%
more empowered to do the work that really matters.
That's what we're going for. This is truly a technology that's going to innovate for
productivity's sake.
When you have people who are more excited to get to their desk every day to do
their jobs as a result of some technology innovation, like, that's where we're all
beneﬁting.
So that one jumps out at me.
Viva Sales is pretty exciting. I used to run a sales team. Certainly, it is similar to
debugging in the software world. If you're a seller, CRM updates are pretty much the
very last thing that you ever want to do.
Yet, sales leaders and marketing, everyone's always, "Get your CRM updates in
there." And so just seeing that some of that sort of repetitive work, again same
concept. Like, take the part out of the work that people truly don't enjoy and give
them more time to do what they do enjoy.
So, Viva Sales is another one that really jumps out at me as pretty exciting.
I think it's just like increasing developer capacity, which is a concern for pretty much
every customer that we talk to.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Right. They're getting out.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-20

A - Jessica Hawk{BIO 20774986 <GO>}
I think sales managers and sellers are feeling the same type of pressure.
So, I think we're going to see a similar cycle of adoption with Viva Sales.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes. I was in the U.S. subsidiary of Microsoft a few jobs ago, and my sales friends
would deﬁnitely agree with you that CRM updates is not what they would consider
the most valuable portion of their day so if we can help simplify that. Eric, similar to
what we do with the platform, maybe -- this is to both of you, maybe if you have a
few more details on Azure OpenAI services.
Then, Jessica, you could help breathe life into it from a customer perspective with
some examples and things that we're seeing people do.
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
Yes, sure.
So, the Azure OpenAI Service really is to provide our customers with access to all of
the latest models that we've partnered with OpenAI to create.
So, obviously, GPT-3 and 3.5 were sort of the ﬁrst versions that people could sort of
get their hands on to experience the power of these large language models.
Then Codex, which powers the Copilot experience, DALL-E 2, which is a visual image
generation one which has seen a tremendous amount of uptake, and then, of course,
the amazing amount of interest we've seen around ChatGPT.
And so being able to get direct access to that model, really for use within their
customers and for -- within all the diﬀerent things they want to do for their
applications.
We've worked at Microsoft really hard at sort of developing that through all of our
diﬀerent applications as well. I mean Jessica touched on that really powerful cycle
that we have of being able to work with our ﬁrst-party customers and really learn,
where is this working, and how do we need to change the way these oﬀerings are set
up, and how do we need to really tune these models to work best?
And so, through that, we're able to oﬀer just much better services on the other end
to our third-party customers, having proven them at scale, having proven out the use
cases with them and really made them work great.

Page 12 of 20A - Brett Iversen
A - Jessica Hawk
A - Brett Iversen
A - Jessica Hawk
A - Brett Iversen
A - Jessica HawkYes. And I'd say in terms of customer adoption, we have over 1,000 customers who
are using the service.
If I were to try to pick a couple that jump out at me, CarMax is a great example that I
love to talk about, especially, again because it's a story of truly empowering an
editorial team where they took all of their user reviews.
So, if you think about the last time you tried to go pick a restaurant for dinner --
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}
-- the stars aren't really getting it done anymore. People are reading through, or at
least I am --
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}
-- to understand more about this restaurant. CarMax has a similar situation when you
think about the service they're oﬀering. It's, "I'm going to buy a car, and I want to go
look at the user reviews on the car beyond the speciﬁcations that they had already
coded into the platform." And so, user reviews are becoming a very good signal for
buyers, but they have a small editorial team.
The last thing that that editorial team wants to do is read through user reviews to try
to summarize what those reviews are saying.
And so, because they had already gone through the digital transformation process
of getting their data up and running into Azure, they were able to apply the Azure
OpenAI Service, which their senior development lead described as a comically easy
thing to do, and I'll get back to that in a second, to then go learn from the sentiment
in the user reviews, and you might say "Well we've had that for a while," but then go
generate ﬁndings from that so that the editorial team could focus on creating the
most engaging experience for somebody coming to try to learn about the cars.
They estimated that it would've taken them 11 years to do what they did in just a few
days and weeks --
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
It's amazing.
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-20
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 13 of 20-- using the OpenAI Service, and so -- and the team is doing their best work.
So CarMax is one example. There's a global Austrian construction company called
STRABAG, very similar situation. They were already getting the need for digital
transformation.
So, they had taken their data estate and done the work of centralizing it up into
Azure.
So similarly, they were able to take the Azure OpenAI Service and use it. They trained
it on just a few months' worth of data, which that's a small sample. They went and
looked at risk for their projects and were able to score Azure OpenAI's ability to go
ﬁnd that risk.
It was eﬀective in 80% of the cases.
So, if you're thinking about companies looking at risk, projects, are they on time?
Are they on budget?
Are there considerations about what's happening at the job site that might put this
project at the top of the list that's worthy of a phone call to see how things are
going?
They have the ability now to get in the driver's seat, not ﬁnd out after the problem
has occurred, but actually start to seek signal earlier.
It's because they're using a service that can run across so much data that is beyond
our ability to keep a developer coding for all the possible diﬀerent inputs.
That's what we mean when we talk about generative AI that it's able to learn and
create new experiences that which it's just impossible to keep up with from a
software developer perspective.
So, they're in a position now where they can go ﬁnd that risk ahead of time, which is
job number one for companies like that.
Then, I said I would come back to it. I think this is a -- it's a rallying cry for our
customers who have maybe been looking at digital transformation and getting the
data house in order. The other part of my portfolio, I've got all the databases.
There's -- customers are trying to make it a priority. There's no question that there's
massive capability and advantage that comes from getting your data house in order.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-20

is there, and it's been working.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}
So why now?
And I would say that this moment, as, again people are starting to internalize what it
can do from a true business impact level, I mean the web experience with ChatGPT
is fun. Nobody's knocking it. I've used it a ton. I had it help me with some naming
things recently.
But these scenarios I just described with CarMax and STRABAG, they're real, true,
hard-hitting problems in the enterprise that they're now saying, "Okay now I have a
real business case for doing that migration."
And so, we've been saying, "Migrate to innovate." And I think we're seeing a
diﬀerent level of conversation with our customers right now, about their excitement
to accelerate their data transformations.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes. I love all these productivity themes that both of you have mentioned. I even --
but even the creativity side.
One of our analysts called me soon after they were able to start playing with some of
the early models, and it was a visualization. He was like, "Brett, this isn't just ﬁnding a
visual that is closest to what I'm describing. This is creating and authoring brand new
content." And we were supposed to have an hour-long call on a whole bunch of
topics, and we spent it all on that one topic because he was so excited.
But well, I don't think you've given risk, and this topic is so big, it's always important
as we're talking about AI and kind of what we're doing now on our path forward to
touch on the responsible AI portion as well, because I know people want to hear
how we think about that, et cetera.
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}

A - Jessica HawkWell I'd start with what you just said there, which is, there's an education journey --
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}
-- that we're all on, right?
What -- why is this moment with these large language models, we're using the term
generative now, what does that mean?
How is it diﬀerent from what we had with neural network capabilities back in 2017?
So, I do think this is an opportunity for us to live our mission where we're truly
empowering our customers. There's a lot of education to be doing.
We've been working very, very diligently on building out responsible-use
frameworks as an organization for many years now.
So, starting in 2017, we started to invest in a focused part of our -- both our legal
team and our engineering teams to build out our principles.
We -- that's a -- it's a huge issue so you have to start with principles.
So, we developed our six principles.
Then our engineering team has basically been customer zero for how you put those
principles into practice.
But what's really interesting and where I get excited in terms of trying to help our
customers, because I think there is a desire to jump into the pool. There's also a
recognition that this needs to be done very carefully, as with any technology, once it
comes into an organization, despite the best of intentions, there's plenty of CIOs
who could validate this, I'm sure. Things tend to take a life of their own, and so I think
similar to how customers think about data governance, they're thinking about
responsible AI governance.
So, we did something that I think is somewhat unusual for us.
We took all of the learning that we developed between our engineering and our
legal team that's really focused on helping think through these issues, and we made
that experience and the standard with which we operate against those principles
available to the market.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-20

A - Brett IversenSo last June, we put the Responsible AI Standard out for customers to learn from, to
adopt.
We always say, "This is a journey we're all on together." And so, we're trying to help
recognize that the principles are great. Customers then want to say, "Okay but when
I get ﬁngers to keyboard, how do I think about doing this?" And so put putting that
standard, think of it as a playbook, out there for folks to learn from, and then, of
course, we continue to just infuse AI capability through tools and into our products
directly.
So our company, customers, leaders, who I think need to meet the demand and the
excitement from the C-suite, from the board, from investors, with an understanding
that they have an ability to go execute against the opportunity and do it in a
responsible way we're constantly infusing that directly into the products and have
continued to put out a bunch of dashboards and toolsets that customers can use to
just go inspect how are we doing against the principles?
Is the model being used the way it needs to be used?
Is there transparency in how the technology is creating insights or generating new
content?
Transparency tends to be particularly important in this space, just to give them a way
to go and seek signal and make sure that things are being used the way that they
would want to be.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Got it. Given the size of the opportunity and the excitement around that in the
ﬁnance world, at least, is, well, how much is it going to cost?
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
That's right.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
And so like, speciﬁcally, kind of the capital spend over time that we think will be
needed to scale this vision the way that we think it will scale.
So, no math speciﬁc needed, Eric, but how would you help us -- if I could adopt you
into the ﬁnance group for a minute to help us think about this, what would you share
with our audience?
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
I was a math major, so I can do some math.

Page 17 of 20A - Eric Boyd
A - Brett Iversen
A - Eric BoydI have no doubt.
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
Yes. I mean obviously, these models are very large and use a lot of data, and so
there's a lot of compute used in them.
So, we certainly see that as a trend that we will see.
But that said, we also -- we use this, the compute fabric that we have, ours -- all of our
GPUs, we use for all of the diﬀerent use cases we have all across the company.
So, by having sort of this common fabric, we really get economies of scale.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
And so, we're able to use the same sets of GPUs for Bing as we use for Oﬃce, as we
use for a lot of our internal training, and all of those workloads really sharing that
common fabric.
So, we see a lot of beneﬁts coming from that.
Additionally, these models are going to get cheaper over time. We're already seeing
that. I mean from sort of the ﬁrst versions that we get of a model to sort of where we
get them in production, we're able to dramatically reduce the cost that it takes to
serve.
We do a lot of diﬀerent work on it. Everything from looking at the individual kernels
of code that are running on each individual piece of hardware and optimizing that to
thinking about how I can use multiple GPUs and machines to sort of pipeline and
stage things together and a lot of optimization techniques.
And I -- with so much focus and interest on this, we're just going to see more. We're
going to see more optimization really coming around that, that's really going to drive
this beneﬁt to it.
So, I think we'll see a lot of beneﬁt from that.
The other interesting thing to think about as you think about sort of this, the cost
associated with it. AI has gravity to it.
So being able to really have these models, and then they need to run on data, the
closer you can sort of bring that data to the model, the speed of light is a factor.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-20

A - Brett IversenWe just can't -- we can't go faster.
So how close can you get things really brings beneﬁt to customers?
And so, if you're looking for the fastest way to sort of serve these models, the fastest
inferencing speed and all those things, bringing everything together is going to be a
big beneﬁt.
So again we see a lot of potential with that in the work that we're doing.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes. I'm sure it's only additive to customer conversations we're already having. It's
just one more compelling reason.
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
Absolutely.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
I mean Jessica sort of alluded to it, right, like, customers that are on the fence of,
"Should I get my data estate in order?
Should I ﬁgure out how do I do my digital transformation?"
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 20815367 <GO>}
"Is it ﬁnally time?" There's so much interest, and everyone is sort of moving in this
direction.
So the people who are the laggards are starting to worry about, "Boy, we might
become the laggards." And so how do they really jump on this wave and really
accelerate the work that they've been doing?
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
One -- before I close this out, one last question maybe for both of you. Yes, just ﬁnal
thoughts and/or kind of what do you think about in terms of what's next?
Like, what would you -- where would you leave our audience in terms of closing
thoughts on this topic?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-20

Yes. I mean, I opened with, I think this is one of the most signiﬁcant technological
transformations in our lifetimes.
So, the other exciting part with that is we're literally at the starting line. I mean we've
ﬁgured out some of the things that we can do, but we're constantly learning and
iterating with our internal teams, with our customers, and sort of starting to see
where all of this can go.
And I mean Jessica touched on the use cases. They're, like, all over the map in terms
of the things customers are doing in every single industry that we see.
So, there's just so much more to come in this.
We haven't reached diminishing returns in any of the things we're starting to see as
we continue to build these models and make them larger and really prove them out.
So, there's just so much opportunity just right in front of us that I think these next few
years are going to be really exciting and fun to just sort of see where they go.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20774986 <GO>}
Yes. I would just add, I was on the phone with one of our large GSI partners this
morning. I would say it's a "where do you want to go with your imagination"
moment.
It's been a real rallying cry for those partners who are taking those customer calls just
like we are around, "Get that the opportunity is here. It's amazing that the technology
is here. I can't believe how quickly you guys pulled all this together. It's available for
us to go build on now too. Help us think through, where do we get started?"
So, there's a lot of ideation workshops going on.
I love that it's a -- I've been around technology for a couple decades now. It's a total
business-and-IT-together moment, which is, I think personally pretty satisfying for
folks that work in this. Lots of conversation around, "We see the opportunity. The use
cases are really quite broad. Let's get excited and focused on, where do we want to
start.
Then let's just go."FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-20

Page 20 of 20A - Brett IversenSo, a lot of our partners are getting super engaged in the conversation in terms of
helping customers continue with their digital transformation and then prioritize,
where do we start with all the opportunity?
So, I think us continuing to support our partners as they build up those practices is
pretty exciting.
Then I would say for sure, it's, again supporting customers on their journey with
regards to responsible AI.
So, you'll see lots coming around more support that we can provide our customers
directly on that.
Then, ﬁnally, we're going to continue to infuse all of Eric's team's goodness into the
rest of our ﬁrst-party oﬀerings, so you can be watching for that as well.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes. When the space is as big as it is, it totally makes sense to me that partners are
like, "Hi, we're really excited, but help us know where to start," because there's so
many places you could start.
Well, I know you both are incredibly busy, given how much this space is on ﬁre.
So, thank you for both your time today as well as your insights. I appreciate it.
And we thank everyone for watching. We're excited, as you've heard, about the data
and AI opportunity ahead, our position in this market where we feel like we're in a
leadership moment, which is really exciting, and the value customers are already
seeing with our solutions. We're glad we had some time to talk to you about it today
so thank you.
