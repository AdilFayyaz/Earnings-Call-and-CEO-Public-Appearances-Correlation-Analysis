{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Thanks, Simona; and thanks, everyone, for joining. I'm delighted to announce that
NVIDIA has agreed with SoftBank to acquire one of the greatest technology
companies the world has ever seen, Arm. This transaction is very signiﬁcant for
NVIDIA, for the tech sector and for the UK where Arm is based. As all of you know,
Arm is the world's most popular computing platform. Arm's customers have shipped
an astounding 180 billion chips based on its CPU. And its technology is used by 7%
of the world's population. Arm chips power everything from cellphones,
smartphones to PCs, to network infrastructures, supercomputers. We have also used
Arm's technology for years including our SoC for Nintendo Switch Console, our self-
driving car computer, the new Mellanox BlueField SmartNICand our Jetson robotics
computer. By combining the world's most popular CPU with NVIDIA's AI computing
platform, we're creating the leading computing company for the age of AI.
Before I get into the deal announcement, let me explain how we see the world and
how this transaction ﬁts in with it. Today, the Internet connects billions of people to
giant cloud data centers. In the future, trillions of devices will be connected to
millions of data centers, creating a new Internet-of-things that is thousands of times
bigger than today's Internet of people.
From smart retail to manufacturing and service robots, while driving cars to smart
streets and cities, computing will extend from cloud data centers to every corner of
the world. The software powering this new Internet will not be written by humans,
but by computers learning from data. This is the new way of computing and it's
called AI. The age of AI is driving a tremendous acceleration in the demand for
computing, precisely at a time that Moore's Law has slowed. This requires a new
approach in computing as legacy architectures are not keeping up. Accelerators
NVIDIA is already computing platform has risen to the challenge and is leading the
path forward and is the backdrop to why this deal is so compelling and
complementary for both businesses.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 19Simon SegarsThere are several exciting growth drivers in our combination. First, Arm's vast
ecosystem. We can bring NVIDIA's GPU and AI technology to large end markets,
including mobile and PCs. Second, in the data center, NVIDIA will turbocharge Arm's
R&D and meet cloud computing customers demand for a higher velocity Arm CPU --
Arm server CPU roadmap. NVIDIA AI would be an excellent support for all data
center CPUs x86-powered Arm. And third, we can accelerate our Edge AI and IoT
roadmap in growth trajectory for the next wave of computing. The combination will
boost our ecosystem of developers who are the cornerstone of our computing
platform.
Arm expands NVIDIA's developer reach from 2 million to over 15 million. The deal
will also bring tremendous beneﬁts to customers. We will oﬀer Arm customers
access to NVIDIA's AI and GPU IP. We will boost Arm's vast software ecosystem with
NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing platform. And we will oﬀer cloud data center
customers the broader computer industry, a stronger server CPU roadmap. NVIDIA
will maintain Arm's open license model and customer neutrality, serving customers
in any industry across the world. We will also retain the name and a strong brand
identity of Arm. And it's home base in Cambridge. Simon and his management team
are excited to join NVIDIA.
This combination makes ﬁnancial sense. It is a great deal for both SoftBank and for
us. We expect it to be immediately accretive to NVIDIA's non-GAAP gross margin
and non-GAAP EPS on closing. It will also more than double our target addressable
market to $250 billion, spanning from computer graphics, smartphones and other
devices, to data centers, automotive, Edge and IoT. I am beyond excited to have
joined forces with the talented people of Arm to build this future together.
Let me now turn it over to Simon to say a few words. Simon?
{BIO 7061810 <GO>}
Thanks, Jensen; and thanks to everyone for joining. The proposed acquisition is a
huge moment for Arm. And for Arm and NVIDIA, it's a new chapter and a new
opportunity for us to change the shape of computing over the next 30 years, just as
we have in the last 30 years. The next wave of computing is where AI will be the
deﬁning technology. The computing platform of the future runs a complex software
stack upon an array of processing elements, CPUs, GPUs and DPUs or data
processing units, and that's across networks with applications running
simultaneously in the cloud on the endpoint and at the Edge.
The hardware and software challenges that must be overcome to deliver this future
are vast, bringing together the technological strength of the Arm and NVIDIA will, I
believe, enable us to uniquely address these challenges and put solutions in the
hands of innovators who will continue to deliver amazing products built on top of
our platforms.
As part of NVIDIA, Arm will continue to operate its open licensing model, while
maintaining the global customer neutrality that has been foundational to ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 19Colette Kresssuccess. With 180 billion chips shipped to-date by our licensees, there is so much
more we can do together as a combined company. As Jensen mentioned, NVIDIA
has committed to opening a new global center of AI excellence in Cambridge, which
will include an Arm-based supercomputer dedicated to AI research and open to
researchers in the UK and the rest of the world. This is a big investment in the UK and
will attract the world's banks to come and work with us and advance the state of AI in
industries such as healthcare, robotics and automation. We believe that the
combined strength in both companies will result in even better solutions for our
partners and we are very excited about the possibilities.
I truly believe that there is an exciting future ahead for Arm as part of NVIDIA, where,
together, we can create even greater impact. This is exciting new phase for Arm and
we look forward to writing this next chapter together.
Let me turn it over now to Colette, who will give you more details on the proposed
transaction.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thanks, Simon. Today, we announced the proposed acquisition of Arm from
SoftBank in a cash and stock transaction valued at $40 billion. We expect the
acquisition to close in approximately 18 months, subject to regulatory approvals in
various jurisdictions. The transaction has been approved by NVIDIA's, SoftBank's and
Arm's Board of Directors. In addition to the strategic rationale Jensen outlined, we
believe this is a ﬁnancially compelling transaction. Upon closing, we expect to be
immediately accretive to our non-GAAP gross margins and non-GAAP earnings per
share.
Arm has a great business model with very high margin, reoccurring revenues. In the
trailing 12 months ended March unaudited pro forma IFRS revenue was $1.8 billion,
with 94% gross margins and adjusted pro forma EBITDA margin of approximately
35%. No, this does not include the IoT Services Group, which is not part of this
transaction.
Let me also touch on the transaction structure. NVIDIA will pay as consideration to
SoftBank and the Vision Fund an aggregate of $21.5 billion in common stock
And $12 billion in cash; of which, $2 billion of cash will be paid at the signing and the
rest will be paid at closing. Additionally, NVIDIA will pay up to $5 billion in earn-out
of cash or stock based on Arm ﬁnancial performance targets. NVIDIA will also issue
$1.5 billion in equity to ARM employees for post-closing retention. Based on these
terms, SoftBank and SoftBank Vision Fund is expected to own, in aggregate, less
than 10% of NVIDIA's stock, depending on the ﬁnal amount of the earn-out in the
form of consideration elected by SoftBank, contributing to continuity going forward.
NVIDIA intends to ﬁnance the cash portion of the transaction with balance sheet
cash.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14

A - Jensen HuangLastly, let me provide an update on our capital allocation strategy. We believe the
proposal, acquisition of Arm is an outstanding use of cash. We expect to continue to
generate a substantial amount of cash in the 18 months that we expect to take for the
transaction to close. We currently have $11 billion in cash and cash equivalents and
marketable securities on the balance sheet. And over the last four quarters, we
generated $5 billion in free cash ﬂow. Our business continues to grow to a robust
pace and we are positive on our future. We expect to maintain an investment-grade
rating, following this transaction and plan to continue our dividend.
We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for
questions? Thank you.
Questions And Answers
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Mark
Lipacis from Jeﬀeries. Your line is open.
{BIO 2380059 <GO>}
Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the announcement. Question for
Jensen, I think. Jensen, you said that dominant compute platforms in the past have
been general purpose platforms. And if you look at the data center ﬁve to 10 years
from now, is your view that this is going to be multiple diﬀerent general purpose
compute platforms with a diﬀerent platform to run parallel process synapse in a
diﬀerent one for serial, or is this ultimately a single platform and that runs all the
workloads, and is that where NVIDIA plus Arm really ends up is that with really
driving core? Thank you.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yeah. Thanks for the question. Appreciate that. A computing platform has to be
programmable. A computer -- a computing platform has to be -- has to allow
software developers to continue to advance and come up with creativity and run old
software, run new software is architecturally compatible from generation to
generation. That's a computing platform.
A computing platform of the last generation we know quite well a CPU ISA [ph] that
has retained its ISA and its compatibility for generations. Going forward, you're
going to see that computers, because of the diverse workloads and because of the
intense amount of computation and the data processing that has to happen,
because no computer stands alone anymore and the type of application it runs like
artiﬁcial intelligence require acceleration. But the architecture that's the most
sensible that the industry is gathering around is a multi-type of processor what is
otherwise known as heterogeneous type of a computing architecture.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14

processing. The GPU is really fantastic at high throughput data processing. And the
DPU is really good at network and serial data movements security processing. These
three types of processors will deﬁne the future of computing. It is exactly the reason
why we're so excited about this acquisition that with Arm and NVIDIA and Mellanox,
we have three computing platforms, one for networking, one for high throughput
computing, accelerated computing and AI computing and one for CPUs and single
threaded computing. These three are incredible platforms with large ecosystems
with industry support broad and wide and together, we're going to be able to do
great things together.
Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your
line is open.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Good morning and thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen,
congratulations on the deal.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Thank you.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
I had a question on how you're thinking about the R&D trajectory at Arm post-close
and Arm's future prospects in the server CPU space. In terms of R&D, if I recall
correctly, I think SoftBank more than doubled Arm's R&D budget post-acquisition to
accelerate innovation, but what are your plans from an R&D perspective, assuming
the deal goes ahead?
And in terms of server CPUs, what would you bring to the table that would
turbocharge Arm's market share growth? And I ask the latter question, because
we've seen many companies in the past take a stab at Arm-based server CPUs only
to, for the most part, being successful. Thank you.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yeah. Toshiya, you and I both know that we've seen the journey of Arm server CPUs
over the last several years. And my enthusiasm is at a time when several things have
changed. But let me ﬁrst answer your question. There are three ways that we will
turbocharge the R&D of Arm server CPU roadmap. The ﬁrst is, NVIDIA's R&D
capacity or R&D platform is much larger than Arm's. And just leveraging the
capabilities we have, the existing capabilities we have and recognizing that we have
a lot of processor development ourselves, even though it's not related to Arm CPUs,
a lot of the tools, a lot of capabilities that we use to develop very high-performance
processors, could be very easily tapped into.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 19Q - Toshiya Hari
A - Jensen HuangThe second is the infrastructure that is required to turn a CPU core into a data center
server platform. It includes the SoC, of course, the rest of the system logic on the
motherboard, the rest of the system including the GPU, the DPU, the system
software, all of the algorithms on top, the various system stacks necessary for the
various main applications whether it's virtualized environments or high performance
computing environments or containerized orchestrated type of environments, micro-
services type of environments.
Each one of those stacks is really, really rigorous and we have the capabilities at
NVIDIA within our -- already within our capabilities to bring all of that to Arm. And so
for the very ﬁrst time we'll be able to create a choice for the data center world that is
absolutely world-class that is complete. The fully integrated, the fully developed and
optimized stacks and as a result, data centers, whether it's in the cloud for whatever
applications or in the enterprise or at the Edge can take advantage of this fully
optimized stack.
And then lastly, there are many things that we're developing both of us that are
developing in our future roadmaps that we can now harmonize. And so the -- just the
existing engineering we already have in our company, when we put them -- target
them to bear focus on to bear on Arm CPU servers strategy will accelerate
tremendously. And I think this is one of the reasons why the customers are going to
love it. The data center -- the cloud data centers have been waiting for the ability to
pull all of this stuﬀ together, the processors, the chips, the platforms, the software.
Until now, it's not really been possible. And that's one of the reasons why it never
succeeded. Building a chip alone is not suﬃcient anymore. The x86 ecosystem is not
just about the chip, but it's about the whole platform solution that has been
optimized over time. For us, we've been doing this and this is one of the great
strengths of our Company. We are a computing platform company that is able to
innovate from the chips to the systems, system software, all the way to the
application stack from top. And for all of the application domains that we do in AI
computing in the cloud, we have a complete stack. And so we should be able to
help customers take advantage of the Arm CPUs readily.
Now whether we build the Arm CPUs ourselves or not is relevant. We're delighted
that Amazon is doing it, the other cloud CSPs have adopted Arm as building data
center CPUs. We're delighted to see Fujitsu use it for supercomputers. And we're
delighted to see NVIDIA's own BlueField use Arm CPUs to oﬄoad the data center
operating system onto the SmartNIC and we're seeing this all over the world. So
data center processors of all diﬀerent types and shapes are going to evolve. And
with our banking, with our combination, we're going to be able to really accelerate
that.

Q - Vivek Arya
A - Jensen HuangOur next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line
is open.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my question and congratulations to all on the announcement.
Jensen, my question is on the regulatory and the ecosystem hurdles. So what kind of
push-back do you see from regulators, especially in China, given all the trade
tensions? And then separately, any push-back from Arm's customers several of
whom are your competitors today and they have unfettered access to Arm's
technology. So what kind of hurdles do you foresee right from both that regulatory
and ecosystem perspective?
And if I could just quickly sneak in one question for Colette, the sense of cost and
revenue synergies and any initial views would be very helpful. Thank you.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
The customers, after they heard the rumors, have reached out to Simon. And he
spoken to a lot of customers. And the fact that we're announcing the deal tells you a
little something that we believe that the customers are going to be satisﬁed with our
genuine intention to keep the platform open and neutral. We bought the company
and we paid, as you know, a very signiﬁcant price, because of the vast network and
the vast ecosystem of Arm. We love the business model. And they reach customers
that we can't reach, they reach industries we don't reach.
NVIDIA sells something along the lines of, call it, 100 million chips a year. Last year,
Arm sold 22 billion chips. We believe all of those chips in the future are going to
include AI computing. We believe all of those chips in the future will be accelerated
computing. And we don't have to build all of them. We would love to extend our
architecture to all of them. And so, the economics of leveraging the core architecture
and the core technology NVIDIA has already built through the Arm network and
ecosystem and this incredible support system they've created over the last 30 years.
And the reputation for supporting IP that they've created. We're going to be able to
take our technology through that, that is incredibly exciting to me.
And so, so that -- the fact that we would like to oﬀer, number one, to keep the
business model exactly as it was before open and fair, and in fact oﬀer all of those all
of Arm's customers even more IP, I think is going to be very exciting. Regulatory,
they're focused on pro competition, a condition that can ensure pro competition and
pro customers, pro customer choice. We are going to bring customers more choice.
We are going to, for the very ﬁrst time, has a credible plan to turn the Arm CPU core
into a full out data center platform. And the data center platform that -- for clouds,
for high performance computing, for Edge, 5G Edge data centers to enterprise data
centers, for the very ﬁrst time we can visualize the ability to do that. Frankly we've
been building that out for every CPU, for every x86 CPUs which are a little diﬀerent
for power CPU.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14

Q - Aaron Rakers
A - Jensen HuangAnd last year we decided we're going to do it for Arm CPUs. We realized what an
incredible investment this is going to be and we realized that this is going to
generate a lot of value, and so -- this combination really allows us to focus that
energy and capture the value and deliver it to the market. Alternative platform that is
going to be very powerful, very capable. And so the regulators love to see pro-
competitive dynamics in the marketplace. And so, we're pro customers, we're pro
competition, the regulators should be very supportive of it.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
And let me see if I can address your question that you had regarding the synergies.
When we looked at this business, remember, this is a piece of the overall Arm
business as a whole. We have a high growth, high performing group coming
onboard here to NVIDIA. We have the opportunity to now expand in terms of our
R&D across both to really attack good portion of this opportunity that's in front of us.
So at this time, it's a little bit early to talk about any of the synergies. But again, I think
we're taking on already a very high growth both performing group.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Thank you.
Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is
open.
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and also congratulations on the acquisition. I
wanted to go a little bit deeper in response to this last question. In your
presentation, you highlight oﬀering Arm customers access to NVIDIA's AI and GPU
IP. Jensen, I'm just curious of how you see that evolving, how deeply you will go in
terms of providing customers with licensable GPU IP? And how do you think about
the NVIDIA business model evolving with this acquisition?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
We're in no mobile devices. NVIDIA builds very few SoCs. We are in very few
embedded systems. And the numbers describe it perfectly. Arm sold 22 billion chips
last year, 22 billion chips. NVIDIA is in the 100 million chips space. The opportunity --
the unserved market is nearly all 22 billion. And so that kind of tell you something
about the opportunity that we see here. And yet, all of those, all of those devices, I
believe, AI is going to deﬁne the way that software is going to get written. And AI
processing will be done in every computer and every device. And those 22 billion
chips are going to be AI computing chips and they're going to do amazing things,
some of them will be robots, some of them will be self-driving cars, some of them
will be 5G radios and some of them will be embedded systems. And those are all
wonderful platforms that we would like to go and participate in, but we can't build
them all. And so, the simple way that we're thinking about it is wouldn't to be greaterFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14

A - Jensen Huangif NVIDIA IP, NVIDIA GPU cores and AI cores were made available through that
network and customers could take advantage of it.
It's really quite as elegant as that. We can't do this. This idea it sounds so simple and
elegant, but it really is impossible, if not for the incredible reach of Arm and the
network of support and the reputation and the engineering operations of turning
technology into IP reusable blocks, all of that is what we're buying into. This
incredibly energy eﬃcient processor, combined with the business model, combined
with the vast ecosystem that has built over the years, this is a once-in-a-generation
company. And now we could take the NVIDIA IP through there. You could imagine
some simple math and the economics could be really exciting.
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Thank you.
And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is
open.
Yeah. Good morning, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess two if I
could. The ﬁrst one, Jensen, we've talked in the past about the diﬃculty of bringing
CUDA to the Edge for low-cost type solution. So, curious how are you thinking about
with the combination of Arm unifying your solution, your CUDA software from the
data center to the Edge. So that's the ﬁrst question.
Then the second is, I guess more on the regulatory side with China you're keeping
the IP in the UK, so I think that's a good start. But curious how you're thinking about
their reaction. Would you grant an evergreen license to China to get approval? Any
thoughts there would be great. Thank you.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
One of the things, C.J., that we all know is that Moore's Laws come to an end. And
there are several things that we know about those 22 billion chips that are going to
get sold and eventually 1 trillion chips are going to get sold. The journey to 1 trillion
chips is through AI. And AI is a accelerated computing method of processing. And
so, in order for us to go from 22 billion units a year to a lot more than that and
having trillions of devices that are around the world that are operating AI software
and operating autonomously, that computer architecture, the computing platform
has to evolve.
The Arm CPU is so energy eﬃcient and the NVIDIA GPU is so energy eﬃcient that we
could increase the adoption of accelerated computing and AI computing in those 22
billion units moving to hundreds of billions of units over years just through the
course of time. And we can now build very sophisticated AI chips in just a few
hundred milliwatts and that ﬁts into a very large number of computing devices. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14

Q - Stacy Rasgon
A - Jensen Huangso, I think, it's a forgone conclusion that computing is going to be accelerated, that
computing will -- most computing platforms will be about AI processing and as the
world leader in AI computing and Arm, the most popular CPU and the largest
ecosystem in the world, we should be able to connect these two things together and
provides the AI processors and our AI architecture, accelerated computing
architecture to all of the ARM partners. And so I'm excited about that part.
With respect to China, the important thing to realize is that the ownership, the
company ownership of the IP is not the relevant issue. The origin of the IP is the
relevant factor in export control. The IP of Arm was originated, created, developed
over three decades in Cambridge. And so, the amount of soft -- the amount of code,
the amount of innovation is measured in thousands of human years.
And so, the IP will essentially stay in the UK. The headquarters of Arm will be in UK.
We're going to continue to advance the technology in the UK. In Arm, in Cambridge
is a pool -- is a company, some of the ﬁnest computer scientists in the world. And so,
of course, we're going to continue to invest there and build there. And so, the origin
of the technology won't change. And as a result, the fact that Arm now belongs to an
American company versus a Japanese company that doesn't change your exports
control in anyway.
Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.
Your line is open.
{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to the customer
acceptance of this. I hear what you're saying around keeping the ecosystem neutral. I
hear what you're saying about the potential value the customers will have. But at the
same time, how does this really work in practice? I mean, it's a practical
consideration that you're going to get ﬁrst look at everything, you're going to control
the direction of innovation of the companies, you're going to know all of your
customers' roadmaps before they do.
So how are they really going to get comfortable with this, especially in some of these
like high performance computing and servers? And I sort of asked this within the
envelope of maybe some of your prior eﬀorts to drive an IP licensing business, which
to my recollection did not go all that well and was not nearly accepting all the
welcome customers. So just in general, given all of that and how much you're going
to -- you own of this ecosystem, how much visibility you'll have into that they're
doing like, how are -- how you're really going to get them comfortable and do you
anticipate any issues. And if there are customer disagreements, would that stand in
the way of closing the deal?

Page 12 of 19Q - Stacy RasgonWe would protect the conﬁdentiality information of all of our customers the way we
do today and the way that Arm does today. Neither of us really know what the
customers are doing with our technology. And of course, we work with every
company in the world and so does Arm work with every computer company in the
world. We keep all of -- we keep everybody's conﬁdentiality protected for all of the
obvious reasons. I mean, we are a computing platform company. NVIDIA sell chips to
all of the computer makers. We also license software to them today that runs in their
data centers or are doing optimizing compilers or all of our CUDA DNA and all of
the AI optimization libraries are licensed to all of our partners. And then, of course,
we provide application stacks even on top of that.
We work in three layers. Our Company has evolved far from the chip company years
ago, we oﬀer technology, which is at the chip level, but we oﬀer platform technology,
which includes a lot of software, a lot of SDKs, and then in some cases we even oﬀer
the entire application stack on top. We open up these -- this three-layer approach of
accessing NVIDIA's platform and the customers decide whether they want to use
layer one, layer two or layer three. And if a customer would like to partner with us, for
example, one of the telcos who want to partner with us, to bring GeForce now to the
market, we partnered with them.
If somebody would like to only buy our GPU and develop the entire stack
themselves for their own cloud gaming service, we're more than happy to do that.
And they're willing to -- if they would like to use layer one and layer two and then
build on top of it themselves for their layer three service or store, we're more than
delighted to do that. We do that in gaming, we do that in autonomous vehicles, we
do that in robotics.
And in the case of Arm, this will just be our layer one technology oﬀering, meaning
that, in the case that a customer would like to have our technology already ﬁxed and
hardened in a chip, that's ﬁne. But if they would like to have it be soft and malleable,
that's ﬁne too. I think that the business model, the modern business model, this is
just not as odd as it seems. We got the cloud and we have infrastructure-as-a-service,
platform-as-a-service, software-as-a-service, and the platforms make themselves
available to you, however, you would like to be -- like you to engage it.
I think, fundamentally, NVIDIA is, of course, going to continue to protect our most
important thing, which is our enterprise reputation, that we have to be a company
that customers and our partners can trust. We are the only AI company in the world
that I know of that work with every AI company in the world. And maintaining that
trust of openness and fairness and protection of people's privacy and conﬁdentiality,
that's something that is pretty sacred to us. And we're going to continue to do that.
And so we decided that this business model was something that we want to bring to
make part of an extension of our company that we think it's great for our business,
it's great for economics, that it's great for our strategy and that it's going to be a
pillar for extending our computing platform. If we believe that, as I do, and we make
a commitment to keep it open, we will.

margins on below 15%. Is the diﬀerential just the removal of the IT services business,
is it stock comp, just what's driving that diﬀerential?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
That's correct, Stacy. As we discussed, we're just buying the IPG group and leaving
the IoT, data science group on that. So that is the most of the diﬀerence between the
two.
{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you very much, guys. Good luck.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Thank you.
Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from J.P. Morgan. Your line is
open.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Morning, and congratulations on the announcement. Maybe to follow up on that last
question, Arm has built its business model around customer neutrality by not
competing with its semiconductor customers. Maybe we can take, Jensen, speciﬁc
examples, in the areas of embedded with your Jetson platform, automotive, with
DRIVE EGX gaming with your ASIC solutions, networking with BlueField processors,
will you guys design your own multi-core Arm-based processor chips. Here you
actually will be competing with your customers. So how again do you address Arm's
customer neutrality philosophy in these particular areas?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
By doing just that, keeping -- staying neutral. Remember, we work with all of the
companies that are in the semiconductor industry. We worked very closely with Intel,
we worked very closely with A&D. We selected A&D in our latest generation DGXs
and we were delighted by it, we celebrated it. And the two engineering teams
worked incredibly close together. We -- people say that NVIDIA's primary competitor
in AI computing is the TPU. And yet, on the ﬁrst day of the ampere launch, the only
customer that stood there with us was the ﬁrst customer that launched was Google.
And so, there is a -- I think that there is a maturity about the technology industry that
it is possible to collaborate largely and in some areas where you compete. We work
so closely with all the semiconductor companies. We buy from them. Our systems
are only possible because our chips and their chips. We don't build every chip. We
don't build voltage regulators. We don't build a lot of repeaters. We don't build a lot
of zerties [ph]. A lot of very complicated things that are inside these systems and weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14

Operatordon't build them. And we rely on core partners to do so and we are grateful for their
partnership. They support us with excellent engineering and we will do so in return.
But mostly, the important thing to realize is whatever business model you decide you
want to endeavor, you've got to believe in it, and you've got to be committed to it.
And this business model, we are committed to the open computing business model.
NVIDIA is an open computing company. On the one hand we build systems, but on
the other hand we completely open the insides of it, so that people could use our
components, whether it's at the platform level, at the system component level, all the
way down to the chip level and all the software in between. We make it possible for
you to use whatever you decide to use.
In the self-driving car world, notice, on the one hand in our Mercedes business
model, we are developing the entire stack, even creating the data center and
operating the ﬂeet for as long as we shall live. For the 10 million, 20 million
Mercedes cars that are going to be out there, we're going to operate them, oﬀer
services and software to it. Meanwhile, we're selling chips to Tier 1s and OEMs
around the world and start-ups around the world who are building their software
stack on top of our chips. And sometimes -- and many times, they oﬀer it to the same
end customers. We're delighted by that. We're delighted by that. We can't win
everything in the world, but the one thing that we believe to be foundational to
everything we do is that the more people use our computing platform, the more
developers are developing on a computing platform, the more resilient, the more
sustainable, the more contribution we can make and the more opportunities it will
ﬁnd for us. That we believe to be foundational.
And so, I will all day long be more than joyed for somebody to not buy our system,
but buy our chip, to not buy our chip, but to license our IP, I'd be more than joyed for
that. It's a win for us no matter what, okay. So I think the business model is something
we love very much. I just got to kind -- you got to see that math. NVIDIA sells 100
million chips a year. There are 21.9 billion chip opportunity for us to go. And we
believe they're all going to be accelerated. Moore's Law has ended. We believe AI
computing is going to be on all of them. Of course, it is; Of course, it is. And so,
considering those facts, the opportunity to use this business model that has taken
three decades to build, of course, we're going to honor it, of course, we love it and
of course we're going to use it to continue to extend our platform. It's wonderful for
us.

Page 15 of 19Q - Matt Ramsay
A - Jensen Huang{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Congrats all around. I actually have a question that I wanted to
ask from -- to both Jensen and to Simon from your own perspectives. Obviously,
NVIDIA is an inﬂuential member of the Arm partnership. You guys have license for
essentially all of Arm's core technology, plus an architectural license for V8, and I'm
sure V9 as it comes out. So I guess, Jensen, the question that I've been getting from
folks is why by the whole company, right. what things are you looking forward to in
close collaboration of CPU and GPU in the data center or putting your IP on clients
and Edge devices could you not have accomplished by just being an inﬂuential
member of the Arm partnership band and doing your own architectural license
implementation of chips. And I guess Simon from the opposite perspective, what
things are you now going to be able to do with NVIDIA's inﬂuence that you might
not have gone under the more traditional Arm relationship with partners? Thanks.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yeah, really good question. Really excellent question. I'm glad you asked it. Why
didn't we just kept a license? We were delightful licensees of Arm. As you know, we,
use Arm in our -- one of our most important new initiatives and very exciting and
something I want to tell you guys a lot more about, the BlueField DPU. We use it for
the Nintendo Switch. It's going to be the most popular, the most successful game
console in the history of gaming consoles. And so, we are enthusiastic Arm
licensees.
There are three reasons why we -- that we should buy this company and we should
buy as soon as we can. And the reason for that, number one, is this. As you know, we
would love to take NVIDIA's IP through Arm's network. Unless we were one
company, I think the ability for us to do that and to do that with all of our might is
very challenging. And so, I don't take other people's products to my channel. I don't
expose my ecosystem to other companies' products. The ecosystem is hard earned.
It took 30 years for Arm to get here here. And so we have an opportunity to oﬀer that
whole network, that vast ecosystem of partners and customers NVIDIA's IP, number
one. So you can do some simple math and try to the decide the scale of your
imagination, but the economics there should be very, very exciting.
Number two, we would like to lean in very hard into the Arm CPU data center
platform. There is a fundamental diﬀerence between a data center CPU core and a
data center CPU chip, and a data center CPU platform, a data center computing
platform. We, last year, decided that we would adopt and support the Arm
architecture for the full NVIDIA stack, and that was a giant commitment. The day we
decided to do that, we realized this is going to get for as long as we shall live. And
the reason for that is because once you start supporting the ecosystem, you can't
back out. And for all the same reasons when you're a computing platform company
and people depend on you, you have to support them for as long as you shall live
and we do. And we take that we take the promise very seriously.
And so we are about to put the entire might of our Company behind this
architecture, from the CPU core to the CPU chips from all of these diﬀerentFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 16 of 19A - Simon Segarscustomers, all these diﬀerent partners, Ampere or Marvell or Amazon or Fujitsu or
the number of companies out there that are considering building Arm CPUs out of
the Arm CPU cores, data center CPU cores is really quite exciting. The investments
that Simon and the team have made in the last four years, while they work out of the
public market has proven to be incredibly valuable. And now, we want to lean hard
into that and make Arm a ﬁrst-class data center platform, a ﬁrst-class data center
platform from the chips to the GPUs, to the DPUs, to the software stack, to the system
stack, to all the application stacks, on top we want to make it a full-out ﬁrst-class data
center platform. Well, before we do that, it would be great to own it. We're going to
accrue so much value to this architecture in the world of data center. Before we go
and make that gigantic investment and gigantic focus, why don't we own it. And so,
that's the second reason.
Third reason, we want to go invent the future of cloud to Edge, the future of
computing where all these autonomous systems are powered by AI and powered by
accelerated computing and all the things that we've been talking about, that future
has been invented as we speak. And there are so many great opportunities there.
Edge data centers, 5G Edge data centers, autonomous machines of all sizes and
shapes, autonomous factories. We, NVIDIA has built a lot of software, as you guys
have seen, Metropolis, Clara, Isaac, DRIVE, Jarvis, Aerial, all of these platforms are
built on top of Arm, all of these platforms are built on top of Arm.
And before we go in and see the inﬂection point, wouldn't it be great if we were one
company? And so the timing is really quite important. I think we've invested so much
in all -- across all of these diﬀerent areas that we felt that we really, really ought to
take the opportunity, own the company and collaborate deeply as we invent the
future. So that's the answer.
{BIO 7061810 <GO>}
So, from my side, if I can follow-up on that, if I can follow that, the way I look at it is a
clearly couple of diﬀerent dimensions. Firstly, just picking up on the point of AI, I do
truly believe that AI is going to be the deﬁning technology of compute for the future.
And we've made great progress on that, we've made great strides in thinking about
AI, the Edge, AI running on the tiniest microcontrollers and how you enable that,
how you do that in an energy-eﬃcient way, how you get the software stack going,
but we are just to be the starting point on this transition to the world of compute
being a world of AI. And we think that by combining forces, there's just so much
more resource and weight that we can put into that. And this gives us an opportunity
to take a lead in a way that we couldn't have done on our own.
Similarly, when we think about the data center, the data center has been one of the
big bets that we've made over the last four years on the SoftBank's ownership. We
just couldn't have done that as a public company, and Matt you and I have discussed
that a number of times over the years. But the increase in R&D that we've done over
the last four years has enabled us to get to a very diﬀerent place and we can now go
further, we can now take that to the next level by applying the might of NVIDIA
behind it. Now, tactically, as we think about the NVIDIA's IP portfolio and how we
might package that up into products that we can license to the rest of our customer
base that gives us more to go and sell. That's great. And we're going to do that. ButFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14

{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Thanks.
And our ﬁnal question today will come from the line of John Pitzer from Credit
Suisse. Your line is open.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Yeah. Good morning. Congratulations, Jensen and Simon. Appreciate you letting me
ask the last question. Gentlemen, you kind of look at the success you've had in the
data center, I think one of the key pillars has been your ability to lower the cost of
compute for your customer well summed up what you always say, the more you buy
the more you save. When you look at the Mellanox acquisition, it's fairly easy to see
how that ﬁts into that prism of lowering the cost of compute in the data center. I'm
just wondering if you can help me understand how I should view the Arm acquisition
through that lens.
And then as a quick housekeeping for Colette. Colette, the $2 billion that you are
giving to SoftBank at signing, is that eﬀectively a break-up fee that has non-recourse?
And is that the only break-up free or how do I think about a potential break-up fee
here if the regulators don't see the world the way you see it?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
As you know, Arm is the most energy eﬃcient architecture in the world. It's the most
energy eﬃcient computer architecture in the world. And computer -- energy
eﬃciency in a power-limited data center, which is always power-limited, whatever
size data center you see, there is a limit to the power that it provisions. The more
energy eﬃciency, the greater number of processors you could ﬁt inside. The greater
number of processor cores you could ﬁt inside, the more throughput or the more
customers you could serve. So whether you want to think about it as in dollars per
compute or the dollars you can make per compute with your data center, either way,
the Arm energy eﬃciency is extraordinary. That is exactly the reason why Amazon is
so excited about Graviton1 and Graviton2. You're going to see many others that want
to follow suit.
And so, the energy eﬃciency of the Arm processors has really, really revealed its
amazing cost beneﬁts in the world of data centers. And now with the workload, and
this is a very important thing, a very important dynamic and I think it was Toshiya thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-14

A - Jensen Huangmentioned it earlier about the previous history of why Arm CPUs weren't that
successful in data centers has fundamentally changed. It used to be that data centers
was hyperconverged and the workload was monolithic virtualized, monolithic
virtualized in a hyperconverged environment. In that world, I used a lot of buzz
words and I'm sorry about that, but in that world, the right architecture is x86, it runs
all of the applications in the world.
But since then, the world has become disaggregated, containerized micro-services.
That is the way that these data centers are built today. Because of that migration,
because of that evolution, applications has been refactored. The applications have
been re-factored and AI has been infused into it. It is now possible to run on any
CPUs. It just has to be very energy eﬃcient, it has to be performant, and most
importantly, very importantly, it has to be supported by all of the computing
infrastructure around it.
The value of the x86 CPU and data centers is not just the core itself, but is the core is
the hardware ecosystem. All of the system components that supported all of the
software services that run on top of it, it's all fully optimized. NVIDIA has that stack.
We have the networking storage security virtualization stack as a result of Mellanox.
We have NVIDIA's AI stack and computing stack whether it's Kubernetes-based or
virtualized-based or cluster-based and multi-GPU based, multi-node based, no
matter what the computing infrastructure environment is, NVIDIA has that stack now.
We're going to bring all of it to Arm. We're going to bring all of it to this new
ecosystem and I think our ability to expand the market is going to be greatly
enhanced.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So, let me just quickly answer that last question regarding the break-up fee. The $2
billion that is paid at signing as essentially a down payment towards the $12 billion of
cash that is owed. Yes, that is all that is a break-up fee. But keep in mind, there is also
an Arm license within that as well. So it's not all break-up fee. And no, there is no
other break-up fees.
