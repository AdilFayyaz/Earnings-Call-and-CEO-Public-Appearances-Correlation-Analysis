Welcome everyone. My name is Phil Winslow, and thank you for coming to the 26th
Annual Technology Conference, very excited to have Microsoft joining us. We have
Alysa Taylor. So, Alysa thank you for coming down. But I think the weather is better
here than Seattle right now. So, I think is the (Multiple Speakers)
I know it's snowing Seattle, which is--
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
This is a win. But thank you for coming down.
Of course, my pleasure.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Joking aside. So appreciate, as always the IR team for all the work they do. So maybe
just to level set things. Maybe your role obviously touches multiple parts of
Microsoft. Maybe for the audience, maybe don't know you as well, can you give us a
sense of your roles, responsibilities et cetera at Microsoft?
Absolutely, so I am responsible for our Azure and our Global Industry business at
Microsoft. And the division that I run is responsible for working closely with our
engineering team and what services we're going to build, and then how we bring
them to market. So how everything from our product strategy to how we price,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-11-29

partners.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Excellent, keeps you busy. There's a lot there. So I think maybe we'll start this
conversation like a lot of the conversations there with sort of the high-level macro
questions and then we'll drill in from there, but you're sitting here today, obviously,
there's more, more questions, just have to look at the news outside, about just a
macro economic uncertainty. What are customer conversations like, you called over
the last month, versus the beginning of the year, how things change?
Well, I think we've all seen this, but there is a variety of things that are happening in
the market right now. So everything from, obviously, the economic concerns that are
happening; all the way to the energy crisis that's happening in Western Europe; and
then the workforce transformation is still very much top of mind (Technical Diﬃculty).
So, there's a bunch of diﬀerent facets that are coming, converging on organizations
that they're dealing with.
Yes . And I think as organizations are looking to, how do they weather these diﬀerent
assets. There a -- there like what - how do you navigate through the hybrid
workforce? How are they able to make employees more productive, but yet still deal
with some of the societal pressures that are coming to bear. So it's been an ongoing
years, we've come out of the pandemic, we've come into these new set of
challenges that we're facing and there's a lot that's happening in the market and
across organizations right now.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Lot of variables, lot of variables. Let's just stay on this topic, but how are customers
prioritize -- prioritizing, and how are the priorities changing really is my question?
And what products are you seeing the most strength and resiliency versus those that
are maybe call it at risk of being pushed?
There's a number of priorities that I would cite. I would say the ﬁrst is obviously cost
and how organizations are managing costs, particular sectors right now, technology
are under great pressure to manage -- eﬀectively manage cost. And so for us, when
we think about how Microsoft is helping, there's a lot that we do around helping
organizations migrate to the cloud.
There's a fair amount of if you think about just IT management, facilities, energy cost
savings that come from migration. So that's been at the top of your how do we help
organizations, leverage the assets that they have, but also be able to quickly migrateFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-11-29

Phil Winslow
Alysa Taylorlegacy assets to the cloud and realize energy savings and overall cost savings. So
that's been a big focus.
The second that we've seen is around automation and this has been prevalent in
most of the customer conversations that both I've had and our senior leadership
team have had around how do you automate things like repetitive tasks? How do
you free up resources? T-Mobile's a great customer of ours, they implemented Power
Automate, which is our RPA system and it saved them 600 FTE man hours,just being
able to free up some of those again repetitive tasks to put people on higher-value
tasks.
So cost savings with migration, automation, hybrid work is another big one. How do
you navigate and hybrid work is taken an interesting, obviously it was all around how
do you get the workforce into a full remote with the pandemic. Now it's well what is
hybrid look like and how are you accommodating those that are remote in-person?
How are you navigating things like people being connected and the social aspect of
that? There's a big component of that in the hybrid workforce. And then the last I
would say is, which is still pretty prevalent is around the data story. So how are you
aggregating data? How are you getting insights? How are you more eﬃciently
running your organization very data-driven culture that hasn't gone away that's still
actually very much at the top of the list of priorities?
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Interesting. Interesting. Yeah, now, I was wondering if you speak to ﬁgure out energy.
I saw a graph recently as how much a 20 megawatt data center in Germany, now,
cost of power, it's pretty astounding, (Multiple Speakers) So that's like, we've talk
about energy, so that was top of mind when I saw that graph, like ooh that's a real
number now.
Yeah. (Multiple Speakers) And you see organizations they're wanting to quantify
these savings like, we talk about a 30% savings when you migrate on-prem
application to the cloud, like these are things that it's aligning both the how you
quantify those savings with the business outcomes.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Exactly. That's excellent. Okay, let's drill on this, on the ﬁscal Q1 conference call. You
can start mainly highlight customers focus on what they were calling optimization of
their Azure states, and that was going to be impacting your growth in the near term.
What are you seeing in terms of optimization? I get that question a lot of, sort of like,
what are they referring to, and like, what are the areas of focus and why?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-11-29
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 10Phil Winslow
Alysa Taylor
Phil WinslowWell, I think optimization is not a new thing. If you think about the cycle, particularly
in cloud-based workloads, you migrate them, you optimize them, and then you
reinvest in new workloads, that's a normal cycle. I think, what we have seen is as cost
pressure has come to bear, organizations are optimizing faster than and putting that
as a priority.
And so we are still very committed to making sure that we're helping customers
seamlessly migrate and then helping them optimize, and then being able to reinvest
in things like automation, security, those higher value data, data aggregation type
workloads.
So, I think that is not a new thing and it's interesting because, if you think about even
an on-prem world, this isn't a new phenomenon, like we virtualized servers and in an
on-prem. So optimizing in a cloud is just -- it's a natural IT cycle.
But it is happening very, very quickly right now, and it's an area of focus for
organizations. And so for us, we're looking at how do we partner with organizations,
help them optimize so they can realize those cost savings. And then again reinvest in
things like making sure they're securing their data workloads, they're securing their
data centers. They're being able to focus on analytics projects to get greater insights
into their business. So it's all about kind of taking those savings and helping reinvest,
to continue to move the business forward.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yeah. Reminds me a little bit of sort of the -- those middle quarters of calendar 2020,
where there was similar kind of commentary from Satya, any sort of optimization
workloads. But then to make way for new workloads in the future and make sure
your state is properly optimized, because when the next wave comes, you need to
make room for that, but make sure what you have is properly, what you call it
resourced, et cetera.
Yes. You asked about those priorities. So we want to make sure that we're helping to
optimize the existing workload, so they can focus -- organizations can focus on the
priorities that they want to expand into.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Exactly. Now industry, let's ﬂip over that. It's one of my favorite themes, I don't know
obviously yours too, but obviously that was a big theme at Ignite this year and
Microsoft now has seven industry clouds available.
And one of the things we've seen is, like customers sort of increasing wand sort of to
be agile and future proof themselves particularly sort of on a verticalized basis. Now,
what industry speciﬁc used cases do you see resonating the most with customers?
And what does the future look like in terms of expanding to more clouds?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-11-29
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 10Alysa Taylor
Phil WinslowThat's a great question. So when we talked about the macro trends that are
happening. But then if you narrow, Zoom in, every industry has a very speciﬁc set of
both challenges and opportunities that they're facing. So if you take Healthcare as an
example. So how you serve patients in a hybrid environment has been top of mind
for healthcare organizations. It came to the forefront in the pandemic, but this notion
of virtual health sort of came out of nowhere.
But it has a real both beneﬁt in terms of being able to make patients be able to
service, be in service in a variety of diﬀerent ways, but then also making the
physicians more eﬀective. Another thing that's facing healthcare right now is
physician burn-out, and that's been -- there's 50% more, the physicians are reporting
50% more burn-out today than they were in the pandemic.
And so like that, like that's -- you're seeing that sort of increases, the time, pressure
along with doing things like routine tasks that we've talked about paperwork in
putting patient data. So that's healthcare and then if you move over into retail,
curbside pickup was something again that didn't exist pre-pandemic and had to
quickly come into the vernacular of every retailer. They're also now looking at how
do you do frictionless check-out.
Manufacturing is all around automation, building the agile future of your factories.
So digital twins is now a big thing of how do you do sustainable factories? So each
one of these industries has these very diﬀerent what I would say, coupled with the
macro trends, these very speciﬁc industry trends that they're dealing with.
And so we at Microsoft have always served, we've served organizations in all
industries, but what we realized is that we had to make sure that the Microsoft Cloud,
so every aspect of the Microsoft Cloud from our application layer, all the way to our
infrastructure layer was -- had a way to verticalize it, to be able to help organizations
realize these trends faster.
And so, we took a pretty unique I think approach to our industry cloud. So other
organizations have separate systems that are designed for industry, what we have
done is we've taken ﬁrst-party assets to verticalize the Microsoft Cloud. So things like
starter applications, data models, connectors, APIs that will actually take these
scenarios like curbside pickup or virtual help and allow an organization to bring the
virtual health capabilities into Microsoft teams, allow them to organize their data in
Microsoft Synapse, be able to then pull all of that relevant data that is patient-speciﬁc
into things like Dynamics 365.
So it's the - we've taken these very, very speciﬁc industry use cases and we've built
technology that will actually enable those used cases within the existing Microsoft
Cloud horizontal assets.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-11-29
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 10Alysa TaylorYes, exactly. It's sort of like a natural progression of software, you start with sort of the
horizontal suite, get all the assets and then you accelerate time to value by
verticalizing them, the functions of packaging to your point, the ﬁrst-party
applications on top of it, so it's great to see that.
And that's like I said, one of the things that we've gotten a lot of feedback on was
just how diﬀerentiated Microsoft and Azure is in the industry, so that was a lot of
great detail.
But I'm going to stick on the industry and cloud for a little bit because, like I said, one
of my favorite topics, I mean, obviously, it's built on the strength of just Microsoft
Cloud as you were saying. What are you seeing sort of across the breadth of your
oﬀerings? You touched on this a little bit, but what Microsoft oﬀers that horizontal
suite is so broad. What are you seeing there? And then put it in a sort of vertical
context?
Well, if you look at the Microsoft Cloud, so if we start with Azure as the global
hyperscale platform, then we look at what are all of the developer assets putting the
Power Platform, Visual Studio that we have to be able to build on top of our cloud
platform. And then you have the application layer. So we have Dynamics 365,
Microsoft 365, that's it on top, so that's -- and then security kind of wraps around all
of that. So that's the Microsoft Cloud.
As I talked about, we've released and you mentioned, we have seven industry clouds
than verticalized that stack. And we continue to look at where are the industries that
have the greatest, at-scale need for that verticalization and what are the used cases
that are most prevalent.
And one of the things that we've seen, and we actually just are most recent industry
call oﬀer is around sustainability, and being able to bring sustainability especially,
there's new regulation coming to market, the Western Europe -- the European
regulation around sustainability and carbon emissions that was just announced at
KAR 27.
How do you then use the Microsoft Cloud for sustainability to meet your
sustainability goals and regulation that is coming? And so, these are areas that we --
and again the sustainability is all around taking all of that disparate data, when you
think about carbon emissions and how do you track carbon emissions?
There are thousands of diﬀerent data sources. It's about bringing in those data --
bringing in that data, being able to organize that data and then actually be able to
report, record and report that data. And so, that's the capability that we have
enabled with the Microsoft Cloud for sustainability.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-11-29

Page 7 of 10Phil Winslow

Phil WinslowAnd again, it's using assets like, our data services, our -- being able to have out-of-
the-box connectors to things like standard ERP systems, and then being able to do
the reporting directly into a system of record, and then use things like Power BI to do
the analytics on top of it. So that's an example of, with the industry clouds, how we
are taking a very speciﬁc thing like sustainability and bringing that to the market.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Great. Let's switch gears a little bit and talk about just sort of the go-to-market
approach. I mean, what makes the Microsoft's approach just diﬀerent? Is it more
about just what you call the product itself? Is there something about go-to-market
motions, sales and marketing process, or perhaps even some of the unique
partnerships that we've all discussed in sort of these speciﬁc verticals?
Deﬁnitely. So when we think about our go-to-market, we start obviously very similar
to what you and I have been talking about here which is what are we hearing in the
market? What are we hearing from customers? What are we hearing from our
partners? We start there. And then we go through what is called a semester planning
cycle. So we actually work very closely like in collaboration with my team, with the
engineering team to say, what are we prioritizing. What do we build by and partner?
Where do we partner in that?
And then, bringing the actual -- probably the newest thing, so that's -- we've been
doing that for years. The semester planning is something that is new and we've got
more rigorous around. But the actual how we bring it to market, I would say the two
facets that are new and where we continue to invest.
One is our account teams are now all vertically aligned, so that's a very big change
for Microsoft, which is having both the deep, deep industry expertise at the account
level, and then having all of our specialists at the technology layer. And so it's this
marriage of industry plus deep technical capabilities that we brought together
across the -- all of our subsidiaries across the world, so that's new.
And then our ecosystem -- our partner ecosystem, so continuing to make sure that
we have, when we think about even on the industry side or on the Azure side, all the
use cases that we've talked about, all of the scenarios, making sure that we have
both system integrators that can bring to bear that very custom solutions.
And then ISV ecosystem, that brings to market the extended vertical and micro
vertical solutions, and so investing in that and there's new capabilities we brought to
market. Our marketplace is a great example of being able to bring all of our partner
solutions to our customers very quickly, through an integrated marketplace. So,
those are some of the new areas of both investment and focus in our go-to-market.

Phil Winslow
Alysa TaylorYeah. That's something that I've heard to, just on the go-to-market particularly sort of
verticalization of it that especially call it in these times than having somebody that
sort of speaks the language of the vertical, somebody that speaks sort of ﬁnancial
services -- selling to ﬁnancial services and saying sort of this is how you even sell the
project internally actually helps you or just sales cycle, your sales process win and
sort of the sales person speaks the language of the customer, it can almost help the
customers sell it internally so to speak.
Yes.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
You're the call it, the Champion, you sell it internally.
Yes. If you sit with the Chief Medical Oﬃcer and try to talk to her about the data
center, him or her, that's not going to go very well. So you have to -- you actually
have to deeply understand what a Chief Medical Oﬃcer is facing every day, things
like, physician burn-out and patient engagement and being able to -- enable
frontline workers. So it's a very, very diﬀerent orientation for how you actually serve
customers.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. So, a right time to make that change. The vertical alignment -- it's now as good
as ever. So wrapping up here in the last couple of minutes here. Let's say we're
sitting on stage two, three years from now, what technology change or trend you
think we're going to look back on and say, hey, this was more widespread or more
transformative for Microsoft's customers and maybe people were giving a credit for
back-ended 2022?
I think there's two areas, the ﬁrst is there's a lot of buzz in the market right now about
the Metaverse. And I think most people think of Metaverse, they think of gaming or
social, but there's actually an industrial side of Metaverse that is emerging, that I
think is one that has a ton of potential.
So if you think, I talked a little bit about digital twins in the manufacturing, but if you
think about being able to blend that physical and digital world in a way that allows
you to do things like replicate entire buildings, replicate entire factory ﬂoors, being
able to then remotely monitor those factories, as an example. So, being able to
replicate, monitor and then actually drive eﬃciency. When we talk about the
Industrial Metaverse that's what we're talking about.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-11-29
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 10Phil Winslow

Phil Winslow
Alysa TaylorAnd so it's a Great Coca-Cola -- their Austrian Bottling Company, is a great example
of. They actually would have to go out and have routine maintenance, which is you
don't know if the factory needs to be maintained, but they actually stood up a digital
twin. They can zero in to all of their diﬀerent bottling companies around the world.
And they actually can then maintain, so actually monitor and maintain that bottling
facility. So they can look at things like water output, they can predict where there
might be breaks in the line.
And so, then they aren't doing the costly ﬂy out to that bottling company and do the
standard 30, 60, 90 day maintenance, they're doing maintenance as needed and
then they're doing predictive maintenance. And they're able to also have their
experts from around the world troubleshoot without having to ﬂy them in.
And so, if you think about that, like then you are both saving costs on things like
maintenance, being able to be in a proactive state, you are actually able to do things
like lower your carbon emissions, because you're not ﬂying people all around the
world to maintain that factory, and you're able to do things like understand where
there is automation that you can reply into the factory to make it more eﬃcient.
And so, I think the industrial Metaverse is something that has huge potential and I
think we're on the very early cusp of realizing that. And so I think that's one that I
would say is we'll sit here and however many years and I think I think it'll be a much
more prevalent type set of technologies that companies are using, because they can
be more eﬃcient, they can save costs and they can be also more sustainable.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Interesting.
So, I put that at the top, ﬁrst. And then I think just a bridge on that, I do think mostly
because of where the world is going, and coupled with regulation, Sustainability and
how you do, not only just carbon emissions but water and waste is another area that
is going to be more and more I think at the top of everyone's list from a priority
standpoint.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yeah. 100% on both those too. Great. Well, I appreciate the time. Like I said, thank
you for your coming -- it was great conversation and well maybe check back in 2, 3
years and we'll check on the Metaverse and sustainability clouds.
I love it. Right. Thank you. Thank you for having me.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-11-29
